<title>-Isms and the Kids</title>
<body>There are moments when my internal eyebrows arch upwards like a giant McDonald&#39;s sign and one of those moments occurred this past Spring when Youngest came home from middle school and pulled a book, lent to him by a buddy, out of his backpack.&amp;nbsp; We had begun chatting and he produced the paperback with the comment that his buddy was a big fan.&amp;nbsp;: The book?&amp;nbsp; Marx&#39; The Communist Manifesto.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - September 2016:&nbsp; The Potemkin Village Shelves</title>
<body>Another month of pricing for the PracticalDad Price Index is finished and the results for September, 2016 are calculated.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index, comprising the full 47 item market&#45;basket, declined in September to 98.28 from August&#39;s 100.19, a full 1.91 basis points (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The 37 item Food&#45;only Sub&#45;Index, comprising the 37 foodstuff items within the basket, dropped even more significantly from August; the September Sub&#45;Index was 97.26, down 2.48 basis points from August&#39;s index of 99.74 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; This is one of the largest swings in either direction in the almost six year history of the PracticalDad Price Index.
Here&#39;s a little perspective.&amp;nbsp; I began the Index in November 2010, in the midst of the Fed&#39;s QE2 Program and both Index and Sub&#45;Index climbed until they peaked in January 2015 (111.32) and December 2014 (115.13) respectively.&amp;nbsp; This was shortly after QE3 ended in late October 2014.&amp;nbsp; It took more than four years to induce these apogees but without the stimulus provided by the Fed&#39;s programs however, deflation has ground away and the both Indices have literally collapsed.&amp;nbsp; The cost of the full market&#45;basket was actually less in June 2016 than at the outset of the project and the food&#45;stuffs segment likewise reached that point in July 2016, a month later.
One of the things that I&#39;ve noticed while pricing for the past several months has been the quantity of items on the shelves and by extension, the condition of the grocery supply chain.&amp;nbsp; This is in terms both of the seeming appearance of more widely spaced shelves and also the periodic disappearance of items from the shelves completely.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not like the photos of desolate shelves pre&#45;hurricane or even the absolute disappearance of product a la  2016 Venezuela, but it&#39;s little things.&amp;nbsp; A particular item will be gone for a month or two &#45; not just unstocked but with even the shelf label gone &#45; only to reappear later; in multiple instances, the item has not only returned but been supplemented by an even lower&#45;cost alternative, what economists refer to as an inferior good.&amp;nbsp; When this has shown to be consistent in the subsequent months, I have have made note and replaced the store&#45;brand with the inferior item in the index pricing.&amp;nbsp; Also noticed has been wider shelf spacing between products in particular grocery departments (health and beauty, cereal, hot dog cases).&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re willing to make the effort, check occasionally for empty space behind the front two rows of products, which might have been moved forward to the very front of the shelf to make it appear more well&#45;stocked.&amp;nbsp; This Potemkin&#45;Village effect is a wonderful metaphor for what&#39;s become of the American economy as the media touts the stock market but the large majority of Americans grow poorer.&amp;nbsp; But it was a recent article about the effects of deflation upon the grocery supply chain at zerohedge that confirmed what I&#39;ve noticed.&amp;nbsp; As prices have collapsed, the entities at the various levels throughout the supply chain are scrambling to adjust and companies are either surviving or dying and it&#39;s the indications of this that are being exhibited subtly in the grocery aisles.</body>

<title>A View From The Ridge, Part 8</title>
<body>There have been moments in the life of this project when I&#39;ve encountered what I now call a view from the ridge.&amp;nbsp; These are instances in which you get a sense that you&#39;ve emerged from the thickets of daily family life &#45; appointments, events, stuff &#45; and find yourself at a juncture where you can suddenly assess where you&#39;re at and where you&#39;re going.&amp;nbsp; This late August  morning is such a time.&amp;nbsp; When the first View note &#45; linked above &#45; was written seven years ago, Eldest was entering high school, Middle was entering his last year of elementary school and Youngest was finishing first grade and discovering a love for baseball.
This morning&#39;s instance was the awakening to the fact that Eldest is now officially out of the household.&amp;nbsp; I awoke early and padded down the hallway, entering a closed door to a room that was now empty except for a single bed.&amp;nbsp; All of the remaining furniture and clothing was gone, packed up and moved out several days previously.&amp;nbsp; Such a process is slowly occurring in Middle&#39;s room, now in college; it&#39;s become clear that this past summer was his last at home as his own studies and professional development will require that he pursue opportunities in major urban areas.&amp;nbsp; All of the furniture is still there, but that which gives it personality &#45; that which makes you understand that it&#39;s Middle&#39;s room &#45; is partially gone to his new college digs.&amp;nbsp; Youngest&#39;s room is still clustered there with his siblings&#39; rooms but he is now entering high school himself and gearing up for a Fall/Winter run at making the school baseball team, a far cry from the T&#45;ball year when I started writing.&amp;nbsp;
In the other direction, the elder generation is finally settled after a lengthy period in which I sometimes wondered whether the sandwich in the term sandwich generation was actually a panini, hard pressed.&amp;nbsp; There are still rough patches ahead as age and disease process continue, but a look backwards is revealing for the thicketed woods through which we&#39;ve come.&amp;nbsp;What hasn&#39;t changed through this is the presence of my Better Half, a person about whom I&#39;ve largely been silent in the writings.&amp;nbsp; BH is my companion and love, a person with gifts at which I still marvel and without whom the thickets would be far more difficult.&amp;nbsp; And perhaps that&#39;s the one of the biggest surprises as I sit here mulling what to write...that as the kids grow and move out into the world, you again find the time and energy to rediscover that one person with whom you began to travel the road.&amp;nbsp; Make the effort to step back from the day&#45;to&#45;day occasionally to apprise where you are and take stock of what you&#39;ve come through, where you&#39;re going and most importantly, who you&#39;re with.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - August 2016</title>
<body>PracticalDad note:&amp;nbsp; The process of writing in the past year has slowed appreciably and has actually come to a stop within the past three months.&amp;nbsp; There are certainly still things to be written because the situations, observations and conversations with the kids have continued nonetheless, but the process of being sandwiched has risen to impressive levels.&amp;nbsp; But it is beginning to resolve and my hope is that life will right itself enough that I can get back to this.&amp;nbsp; That said, I at least managed to get the pricing for the Price Index done.
The prices for the August 2016 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index have been noted and the results calculated and they are, as they were in July, continuing to bounce around at the levels they were when the Index began in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; The full marketbasket of 47 items actually rose over half a point in August to 100.19 from July&#39;s result of 99.51 (November 2010 = 100) while the 37 item foodstuff only Sub&#45;Index rose almost three quarters of a basis point to 99.74 from July&#39;s result of 99.01 (again, November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; Certainly there are items that are more expensive than they were at the outset of the project almost six years ago, but enough items have been offset enough in prices to actually bring the average cost of the marketbasket back to a point at which it stood back in November of 2010.
What is notable about this month?&amp;nbsp;
There is yet another product that is being dropped from the shelves by grocers because it apparently doesn&#39;t generate enough revenue to justify its continuance on the shelves.&amp;nbsp; This store&#45;brand item is still available at a single grocer but even that item was noted to have undergone stealth inflation as the container size dropped from 12.8 ounces to 12 ounces.
There continue to be instances in which the shelving is empty at different parts of the store.&amp;nbsp; There were several instances this month in which the sampled items were absent from the shelves and it was only by locating the shelf label that I could verify whether or not it continued to be even offered.
There is yet another instance of stealth deflation as one of the grocers returned it&#39;s packaging to the original size.&amp;nbsp; The cost is higher than it was with the smaller packaging, but on a per&#45;ounce, price&#45;adjusted basis, it is less expensive.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - July 2016:&nbsp; Confirming Deflation</title>
<body>It used to be that you could get a candy bar for a nickel.&amp;nbsp; Then a year later, you could get three candy bars for a dime.&amp;nbsp; A year after that, nobody had a dime.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&#45; explanatory comment about deflation by &#39;Dryfly&#39; to the writer in the comment thread of Calculated Risk, circa 2008
The prices for the PracticalDad Price Index grocery basket have been collected from the three separate and unrelated grocers and the results continue to confirm deflation and the failure of the Quantitative Easing programs to spark moderated inflation.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index of the 47 item basket dropped again, this time to 99.51 from June&#39;s 99.90 (November 2010 = 100); the 37 Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index (the 37 foodstuff items such as dairy, meats, etc) likewise dropped from June&#39;s 100.24 to this month&#39;s level of 99.01 (again, November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The upshot?&amp;nbsp; Although the aggregate cost of the full basket was actually less than at the project&#39;s outset in November, 2010, the aggregate cost of the 37 foodstuff items within the basket was still slightly higher.&amp;nbsp; As of this month&#39;s result however, that Sub&#45;index is now likewise lower than at the project&#39;s outset in November, 2010.&amp;nbsp; So yes, hamburger will still cost more than almost six years ago, but there have been enough changes in other items to offset that and lower the aggregate cost.
You&#39;d say that prices have actually decreased, which is seemingly a good thing.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s supposedly what we want, with prices stable or even a little lower so that we can get more for our dollar.&amp;nbsp; But it really isn&#39;t all that it&#39;s cracked up to be and the opening comment from Dryfly &#45; the nom de blog of an exceptionally astute individual &#45; illustrates why.&amp;nbsp; Prices for items can go up and down for different reasons, but the largest reason for the prices of everyday items to rise and fall is the aggregate amount of money coursing through the economy.&amp;nbsp; When there is sufficient money flowing through, normally through family income, people are willing to spend and the price of a particular item is usually the point at which buyers and sellers agree that a sale should occur.&amp;nbsp; It used to be that you could get a candy bar for a nickel.&amp;nbsp; But if the underlying money supply begins to diminish, buyers become more cautious about how they spend their money and sellers have to work harder to persuade buyers to spend their money.&amp;nbsp; Then a year later, you could get three candy bars for a dime.&amp;nbsp; In a truly deflationary economy however, the money supply held by the public is so low that people simply have no money or refuse to spend what little they have and the sellers simply go out of business.&amp;nbsp; A year after that, nobody had a dime.&amp;nbsp; The unspoken phrase in this brief sentence is that there was nobody around to sell a candy bar, either.&amp;nbsp; This was the Great Depression of 1929 in a nutshell and it&#39;s not for nothing that Ben Bernanke was selected to replace Alan Greenspan as chair of the Federal Reserve since Bernanke&#39;s theses had been about the then&#45;Fed&#39;s errors in responding to the Depression.&amp;nbsp; People lost their money and businesses lost control of prices as they engaged in bare&#45;knuckle behavior in order to stay in business and more often than not, they went bankrupt.
So this new monthly Index level isn&#39;t as good of a thing as the Fed would like to see.&amp;nbsp; It continues to illustrate the effect of the family&#39;s loss of income; for the average family, not only is their income less, but they are now forced to contend with competing demands for their income as other costs are off&#45;loaded by corporations and the government onto their narrow shoulders.&amp;nbsp; It also says something that despite the efforts of a central bank to inject trillions of dollars into the economy, so little has been accomplished for the family while so much has been accomplished for the uber&#45;wealthy, the .01%.&amp;nbsp; The grocers are taking multiple approaches to both maintain sales and keep things affordable for the consumer:
They are keeping meat prices within reach by starting to contract with high volume meatpackers who sell their products in chubs.
They are now including what economists refer to as inferior goods, i.e. items that are cheaper substitutes that wouldn&#39;t be purchased when incomes were more flush.&amp;nbsp; When I began this project, the most affordable alternative on the store shelf was the generic store brand and the inferior good alternatives were available only at discount grocery stores where the majority of the population doesn&#39;t shop.&amp;nbsp; But the grocers are now starting to introduce these labels into their own stores so that the store&#45;brand products become the mid&#45;line alternatives.
They have always paid attention to the profitability of items on their shelves but now instead of dropping individual brands, they are dropping entire products from any producer so that the consumer no longer has that option within that store.&amp;nbsp; The logistics of the survey are that I visit the same three stores each month and price the 47 marketbasket items within each for a total of 141 items cumulatively.&amp;nbsp; Already, I have to account for the fact that two of the three stores no longer even stock one of the original items and that particular item is now dependent solely upon the remaining store for inclusion; if that store were to drop the item, I would end the survey.&amp;nbsp; This month, two separate grocers each discontinued carrying a single item and that leaves me with two more of the 141 now missing.&amp;nbsp; I have given thought to discontinuing the project if it reaches a point that so many of the original items are missing that the validity is threatened but it&#39;s not enough of a factor yet that it&#39;s in the cards.&amp;nbsp; Of course, if it does reach that point that too many of these common grocery items are missing from the store shelves, then it&#39;s moot because we&#39;re going to have far bigger fish to fry instead.
The grocers are decreasing their overall inventory and placing less on the shelves.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d noticed in the past year that shelf spacing was becoming erratic and in the past several months have purposefully paid attention to the appearance of the shelves.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve seen is that the grocers do seem to be increasing the empty space between products although I haven&#39;t gone in with a ruler to measure them.&amp;nbsp; In the case of one grocer, there&#39;s an appreciable difference in the shelf area for non&#45;food personal care items such as shampoos and in another, in the cereal aisle.
The grocers have periodically changed their package sizing to meet the situation.&amp;nbsp; When the QE programs were in effect and commodity prices were rising, products underwent stealth inflation as prices remained the same yet the package sizing decreased so that the net effect was an increase in price for that item had the sizing remained the same.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve begun to see is the reverse, stealth deflation, as the package sizing is actually increasing with either no change in price or only a moderate increase that reflects an actual price drop in the item.&amp;nbsp; This has happened several times with store&#45;brand coffee and most recently with the Suave Shampoo brand, which replaced the 22.5 ounce container with a 30 ounce bottle.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the shampoo, the price changes have not been high enough and when the pricing is recalculated to the original size bottle, the effect is a per ounce price cut.
The grocers are also finding ways to mass their purchasing power and force concessions from the producers.&amp;nbsp; The one grocer is owned by an international firm and I can see how they&#39;re exerting their buying power on the producers as they&#39;re simply cutting prices on more and more items.&amp;nbsp; There is also the likelihood that they&#39;re driving things down purposefully in order to overwhelm and outlast their smaller competitors; yet the reality is that the prices on similar items are being cut in the other grocers as well.
The takeaway is this.&amp;nbsp; These changes aren&#39;t occurring because the grocers and producers are being kind to stretched consumers.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re happening because the grocers have to find a way to maintain sales in a population in which the money increasingly just isn&#39;t there.&amp;nbsp; And that is deflation.
And now for the past six months of results.&amp;nbsp; Note:&amp;nbsp; There was an error in last month&#39;s table for the June results and I have corrected this in this table.&amp;nbsp; The correct figures were reported in last month&#39;s text but the numbers were listed incorrectly in the table.&amp;nbsp; This did not, however, alter the fact that the Total Index for June 2016 did breach the original index floor of 100 for that month.

<category>Family Management</category>
<title>Inventory Management on the Other End</title>
<body>It shouldn&#39;t be this way, but a fair part of being a parent is inventory management as you try to work through all of the stuff that comes into the home.&amp;nbsp; You are fortunate if you have links to other families with growing kids and are able to save money by sharing hand&#45;me&#45;down clothing.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a great thing but the down side is that you can&#39;t control when it arrives and so you suddenly find yourself working through one or more bags to ascertain what might work.&amp;nbsp; This process also involves corralling a resistant child who would rather have a tooth extracted than try on clothing.&amp;nbsp; Dad, it fits, it fits already! kvetches the youngster as he edges towards the door in the hope of escape.&amp;nbsp; But the process slows as the kids grow and reach their expected height and sense of style and the push to manage the inventory diminishes.&amp;nbsp; There does come a time in middle age however, when the necessity to manage the inventory again grows and you find yourself handling boxes, bags and paperwork except that this time it&#39;s on the other end of the age spectrum.
So precisely what do I mean by the other end?&amp;nbsp; If you have kids when you&#39;re younger, the other end will be the kids as they come and go to college and you suddenly find the living room or garage again full of boxes and bags brought home from school for the summer as they have to vacate dorm rooms and campus apartments.&amp;nbsp; You turn around and Wham!, you&#39;ve got a raft of  debris filling the family space.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;ve had kids when you&#39;re older, then the other end will consist not only of the kids returning but also the elders who are liable to be looking to lighten their own load.&amp;nbsp; About two years ago, my mother&#45;in&#45;law &#45; actually a wonderful woman &#45; showed up to visit and handed me a box of old tupperware containers with the comment This makes me happy, so just say thank you.&amp;nbsp; The saving grace in this little episode is that it was a ripple on the shore compared to the tsunami that arrived years ago when two elderly relatives on both sides of our family entered retirement facilities in the same summer, an event from which my garage has never fully recovered and has led to the requisite rental of a storage unit.&amp;nbsp; That summer&#39;s nadir was the arrival of a one&#45;horse plow fished at the last minute from the suburban backyard shed of an elderly grandmother, who had kept it out of a sentimental attachment to her North Carolinian farmer&#45;father.&amp;nbsp; That it wound up at our house was a testament to the amount of items and the rapidity with which they had to be disposed.&amp;nbsp; My wife&#39;s thought was just bring it north and we&#39;ll figure out what to do with it.
Why go to the effort of trying to sort and manage it instead of just tossing it into a dumpster?&amp;nbsp; First, there is actually an emotional component to some of the items.&amp;nbsp; I began writing this article in my spare time three nights ago and last night, Eldest &#45; now a college graduate &#45; inquired about a half&#45;completed quilt begun for her many years ago by her now&#45;deceased great&#45;grandmother.&amp;nbsp; It is presently wrapped and stored in our basement and I suspect that she&#39;ll pull it and complete it herself.&amp;nbsp; But the other reality is that there are also heirloom and economic issues as well.&amp;nbsp; Our own children will become adults and anything that we can do to help get them established &#45; and providing them with quality furniture checks off that box &#45; is worth the effort.&amp;nbsp; They might not appreciate an heirloom solid cherry desk or bedroom suite now, but I expect that they will when they&#39;re older and don&#39;t have to fork over money for knock&#45;off imported crap.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not for nothing that we took in a 75 year old single owner Baldwin baby grand piano from a deceased family friend; Middle already loves the instrument and we&#39;ve all agreed, even his siblings, that it will someday go to him when he is capable of taking it.&amp;nbsp; What that means for us is that we&#39;ve had to rent a storage unit and take care of what and how we place furniture there in order to maintain it and prevent its ruin.&amp;nbsp; It also means an on&#45;going review and debate of what we can and need to keep as we move forward.&amp;nbsp;
What are some of my criteria?
First, is there a story or something truly personal about it?&amp;nbsp; A hand&#45;made wool Navaho blanket given as a wedding gift to my parents more than six decades ago...stays.&amp;nbsp; A half&#45;completed quilt for a great&#45;grandchild...stays.&amp;nbsp; A stack of blankets/towels/linens from Target...gone.
Is the item one that will actually have a perceptible use or value to myself or one of the kids within the next X number of years?&amp;nbsp; Toolbox full of old shipbuilding tools?&amp;nbsp; Gone.&amp;nbsp; Excellent condition baby grand piano?&amp;nbsp; Stays.
Is it better shared elsewhere if there&#39;s historical or collectible value yet space is an issue?&amp;nbsp; Maybe that vintage Wehrmacht microscope with Zeiss optics and signed factory inspection papers is better served at a museum than in my attic (actually happened here).
In the alternative, can I better use the money from selling or donating it?
Can I properly store the item without causing it damage and would proper storage be cost&#45;prohibitive?
Does my better half likewise agree with the decision?&amp;nbsp; If not, then it&#39;s probably best to just suck it up and manage until the situation resolves itself either via change of circumstance or mind.
If you sit back and consider them, you&#39;re likely to find that there are other decision criteria than what&#39;s just listed above.&amp;nbsp; But the important thing is to understand that the time is likely to come when you&#39;re going to be involved in helping to manage the inventory of elderly friends and relatives.&amp;nbsp; When it does, determine your criteria and then hew to it as closely as possible.
Just what did happen to the horse&#45;drawn hand plow?&amp;nbsp; After a few weeks sitting in the garage as we worked through the other items, my wife suggested that I contact a local state historical museum that specialized in early American agriculture and I did so, leaving multiple messages over several weeks with the director and receiving no response.&amp;nbsp; Several weeks after the last phone call, the plow went to the curb to the curiosity of neighbors and garbagemen.&amp;nbsp; Two weeks after that, the museum director called me back.
But at least the plow was out of my garage.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - June 2016:&nbsp; We Just Broke the Buck</title>
<body>The PracticalDad Price Index for June 2016 is completed and calculated and the results are simple.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index of a market basket consisting of 47 grocery store items again lost ground from the previous month and broke the buck, actually declining to a level below its initial start point in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; The June 2016 Total Index declined to 99.90 (November 2010 = 100) from May&#39;s near&#45;zero reading of 100.66.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index of 37 foodstuff items within the same marketbasket likewise lost ground from May&#39;s level of 101.60 to this June&#39;s reading of 100.24 (November 2010 = 100).
What precisely does that mean?&amp;nbsp; Simple:&amp;nbsp; It now officially costs less to buy the market basket of 47 grocery items than it did at the beginning of the survey in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; So much for Quantitative Easing.
What does it mean to break the buck?&amp;nbsp; The term comes from the money market group of mutual funds and refers to the scenario that all money market managers try desperately to avoid &#45; when the Net Asset Value of their fund&#39;s actual investments decreases below the $1 per share floor.&amp;nbsp; Understand that money market funds are considered to be the safest investments around since they invest their proceeds in extremely short term debt instruments, which are of such short duration that they are considered ultra&#45;safe.&amp;nbsp; But while safe, money market funds aren&#39;t insured by the FDIC so the managers work assiduously to ensure that their share Net Asset Values don&#39;t break the buck and breach the $1 floor, an event with signficant psychological impact upon the fund&#45;holders.&amp;nbsp; The last time that a fund did so was in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis and the government actually created a fund to insure and stabilize that market.&amp;nbsp; As I sat and reviewed the results, it seemed to be an appropriate term that&#39;s applicable to situation.&amp;nbsp; The Fed&#39;s intent with the multiple Quantitative Easing Programs was to invoke inflationary pressures and so long as they could inject liquidity into the system, it managed to create a modicum of steam to drive inflation.&amp;nbsp; But the ending of QE 3 in late October of 2014 doused the boilers and brought a deflationary return that commenced within only two months and has continued almost continuously since then.&amp;nbsp; What it took the Fed to accomplish in 49 months &#45; with some help from real supply/demand issues in beef and dairy &#45; has been simply reversed back to, and beyond, the original point in only 18 months.&amp;nbsp; The Fed must indeed feel like that 2008 Fund manager as they too, break the buck to a point where they don&#39;t wish to be.
And now for the past six months of results.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - May 2016:&nbsp; Start Watching the Shelves</title>
<body>Deflation reigns.
The May installment of the PracticalDad Price Index is now ready, prices for the 47 item marketbasket gathered at three unrelated grocers, averaged and calculated.&amp;nbsp; The result?&amp;nbsp; Deflation continues as the Total Index dropped from April&#39;s level of 101.64 to a current level in May 2016 of 100.66 (November 2010 = 100), a decrease of almost a full basis point.&amp;nbsp; When I remove the ten non&#45;food items, the remaining 37 item Food&#45;Only Index did increase marginally from April&#39;s 101.40 to May&#39;s 101.60 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; This month&#39;s Total Index drop was fueled by one grocer&#39;s decision to drop the cost of a package of Enfamil formula and another&#39;s decision to significantly drop the price of both adult and children&#39;s store&#45;brand ibuprofen.&amp;nbsp; Magnify these types of decisions by the untold number of prices that are on the shelves of grocers across the United States and you have a sense of what&#39;s occurring.
There is another significant difference this month and that pertains to what I&#39;ve noticed as to the inventory levels maintained by the grocers.&amp;nbsp; There have been occasional blurbs noted online &#45; and I can&#39;t verify where I&#39;ve read them &#45; about what might be going on with the inventory levels at retailers as people might have noticed that clothing racks suddenly appear to be more widely spaced apart than they might have been in a previous visit several months before.&amp;nbsp; Because the PracticalDad Price Index is a monitor of grocery prices instead of inventory levels, I haven&#39;t paid explicit attention to what&#39;s happening with the product inventory.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve begun to notice within the past years in a huh... fashion as shelves might appear to have fewer of the item in stock than previously or even missing it completely, leaving me to work with the shelving label.&amp;nbsp; But I was taken aback this month to see entire gaps in the frozen food section of one grocer as multiple products were missing in entirety from the case &#45; and the shelves were still labelled for those products.&amp;nbsp; This observation raised a mental concern and that concern was confirmed when I visited another grocer to find a perceptible difference in the quantity of products on the shelves of the health/beauty aisle.&amp;nbsp; In this particular store, there was the typical variety of health/beauty products for sale but in far less quantity than I ever recalled seeing previously; there would be handful of an item but it would be set back against the back of the shelf and the front part of the shelf would be completely empty.&amp;nbsp; Magnify this across an entire spectrum of products in the health/beauty section and it appeared utterly barren.&amp;nbsp; When I continued through that particular store, I began to note other areas in which the product line appeared to be well&#45;stocked but only because the amount on the shelves had been moved forward but there was very little behind it.&amp;nbsp; In other words, there was no product in depth on the shelving as I&#39;d seen in previous months or years.
So what is the upshot?&amp;nbsp; As family incomes continue to decline and the middle&#45;class American is stretched, this economic emaciation is beginning to move through the greater economy as grocers now appear to be far more actively culling their inventory levels to maintain their margins and profitability.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve already noted that a grocer might opt to no longer carry a product because it simply isn&#39;t profitable &#45; two of the three grocers no longer carry cases of size 3 store&#45;brand diapers, for example &#45; but this is now moving beyond the individual product choice to a broader spectrum.&amp;nbsp; So when you next walk through the aisles, looking at the shelves and have a huh... moment, there&#39;s a decent chance that it isn&#39;t just you.</body>

<title>A View From The Ridge, Part 7</title>
<body>I&#39;ve said before that being an engaged father is akin to hiking a heavily forested area.&amp;nbsp; The life with kids and their activities is a forest for the trees experience as the rush from one place to the next fills your vision and planner and you don&#39;t always have the opportunity to take a moment to reflect.&amp;nbsp; But then your wooded trail comes to a ridgeline and you can suddenly see for miles, backwards to where you&#39;ve been as well as forward to what lies ahead and you sit for a moment and take it all in.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case this weekend as Eldest &#45; who was in middle school when I first thought of this site &#45; graduated from college.
The benefit of arriving early to grab seats for elderly relatives was that I could look in different directions from the ridgeline.&amp;nbsp; When I looked in one direction, considering the event in terms of this website, Eldest had progressed from middle&#45;schooler to college graduate.&amp;nbsp; Middle, the elementary school kid at the site&#39;s inception, had arrived the previous day with his grandparents, who picked him up at a nearby train station where he&#39;d caught a morning train from the city where he himself is now in college.&amp;nbsp; Youngest, at the outset just entering kindergarten, was now himself in middle school and en route to becoming a truly stalwart adult of honestly surprising capabilities of observation and common sense.&amp;nbsp; When the doors finally opened and I found seats that worked, my Better Half ushered in her parents and the sons followed with Boyfriend, who had come along unannounced to surprise Eldest.
In another direction from the ridge was to see things in terms of the college experience and while one was now graduating college, the youngest was still a good two years away from beginning the pathway to higher education; it will probably be a college degree given his growing skill set and inclination, but the reality is that the cost of a degree is such that it can no longer be the de facto choice, the road taken simply because it&#39;s what everybody is expected to do when high school is finished.&amp;nbsp; My wife and I have now lived through two rounds of college solicitations &#45; and folks, it&#39;s fascinating to see how different the college mailings are from one kid to the next &#45; and prospect visits, completion of the dreaded FAFSA and the excitement of the acceptances and first moves away from home.&amp;nbsp; What also crossed my mind was that the funding of college was now a family affair.&amp;nbsp; This was, for Eldest, a communal family effort as her debt&#45;free degree was in due to multiple parts:  a decent scholarship that made the difference between this particular university and a local state university; four years of hard work through summer jobs to help pay for her annual contribution to the cause; years of savings and then input into the pot by us; and a lovely piece of generosity from another elderly relative.
In another direction was the view of my own age and mortality.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s now more than two decades since Eldest&#39;s birth and as she has aged, so have I.&amp;nbsp; Some years ago, a now&#45;deceased elderly friend commented to me that in his head, he was the same guy who once served as a Marine and a firefighter and I have come to appreciate his statement.&amp;nbsp; All three of the kids have grown up knowing that their father has a physical debility and each has adapted to it through the years.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s fallen most upon Youngest to help pick up the slack caused by the issue and his siblings&#39; college absence.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a most curious coincidence that he is now the largest and strongest of any of us within the household, most capable of picking up and covering for said slack and I go to lengths to avoid abusing him because of it.&amp;nbsp; I have to admit that there was conflict between personal pride and common sense during the wait, as I considered a lengthy drive behind the wheel of a 16&#39; box truck with no cruise control and it was only after acknowledging to myself that I&#39;m no longer a thirty&#45;something young father, that I agreed to let someone else handle that aspect of the move.&amp;nbsp; I plan to be around for Youngest&#39;s event in less than a decade but there&#39;s a point at which you realize that it&#39;s time to adjust the speed downwards and go for distance instead of speed.
But doors open, crowds enter and the view fades and you are once again in the forest amidst the trees, waiting for that next moment when you reach the ridge.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I should make it a point to try for the ridgeline more often.</body>

<title>Post-Consumer Parenting</title>
<body>We have many jobs and roles as parents, too many to note.&amp;nbsp; But all of these things happen to only one purpose &#45; to raise the kids to make their way in the adult world; successfully, we hope.&amp;nbsp; Much of their success will be dependent upon their own efforts but it&#39;s the simple truth that their efforts will be built upon the foundation that we give them.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s crucial that we teach them about the great, wide world then we have to understand that the world in which we were ourselves raised has changed and that particularly goes to our economic system.&amp;nbsp; We must now purposefully buck the long&#45;prevailing consumer&#45;model &#45; in which the lion&#39;s share of American economic activity is predicated upon the typical American&#39;s willingness to spend &#45; as that is functionally dead.&amp;nbsp; We have to now raise our kids to both survive and live within a post&#45;consumer system.
Post&#45;consumer is a term typically tied to ecology and sustainability.&amp;nbsp; We see the term posted on the park benches made from recycled plastic products and on cereal boxes touting that they&#39;ve been made from 30% recycled paper and cardboard materials.&amp;nbsp; It has come about because of the earth&#45;friendly ecology movement that launched in the latter part of the twentieth century and the whole movement has a new&#45;age, California, touchy&#45;feely vibe to it.&amp;nbsp; Yet post&#45;consumer also has a much more hard&#45;nosed aspect to it that is intimately tied to what we&#39;re seeing in both America and the world around us.&amp;nbsp; Remember that the words ecology and economics are at their heart related to the same thing, albeit from different angles.&amp;nbsp; Each is based upon the prefix eco&#45;, derived ultimately from the greek oikos&#45;, meaning household or habitat.
Ecology literally translates as the study (&#45;ology) of our household or habitat but became synonymous with the environment in the wake of a series of widely covered environmental disasters such as the infamous incident in which an Ohio river, the Cuyahoga, caught fire in the late 1960s.&amp;nbsp; It was inconceivable to even the most common person that water could be so utterly polluted and fouled that it lost the most basic property of being able to extinguish burning debris floating upon it.&amp;nbsp; Coupled with a multitude of images of dead and befouled wildlife and adopted as a cause by the then&#45;young and hip Boomer generation and it took on today&#39;s evocation.&amp;nbsp; Economy is a word likewise coupled with the root of household and habitat but from a different aspect, that of how it is numbered (&#45;nomics).&amp;nbsp; Step back from the hard&#45;math financial aspects promoted by many economists, economics is at its heart a matter of how our resources are not only numbered but allocated and &#45; boy howdy! &#45; are we looking at the America of today.&amp;nbsp; Wealth gap, anyone?
Ours is at least the third generation to be raised under the consumer&#45;driven model of the economy.&amp;nbsp; This model conceives of the average American &#45; the consumer &#45; as a driver for economic growth and was first proposed by macro&#45;economists in the early twentieth century but didn&#39;t become an economic reality until it was pushed in the years immediately following the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; The principal economic driver beforehand had been Business and Capital Investment but its collapse in the Great Depression meant that American political and economic leaders began to look elsewhere for a driver to supplement that if not outright replace it.&amp;nbsp; What made the consumer&#45;model possible was more than just the growth of personal income via well&#45;paying jobs; it was also that many costs previously borne by the individual were now partially borne by other sectors of the economy.&amp;nbsp; Insurance for health&#45;care costs was becoming a standard benefit for corporations that hired many Americans.&amp;nbsp; Educational costs for the youngsters was subsidized by the state first via the GI Bill of 1944 and then subsequently through public funding of state supported colleges and universities.&amp;nbsp; Old age was no longer feared economically as there were corporate and public&#45;sector pensions and the government now guaranteed a base minimum via Social Security.&amp;nbsp; There was now not only income, but disposable income that allowed for the things &#45; the niceties &#45; that were previously unaffordable to previous generations.&amp;nbsp; The wants that we&#39;ve now been ably taught to accept as needs.
The truth is that the consumer&#45;driven model is now functionally dead, an economic zombie shambling along and awaiting the merciful head shot that drops it, allowing it to be kicked into the gutter and out of the way.&amp;nbsp; The very factors that made it possible are either falling away as we watch or gone completely.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve now seen almost an entire decade of falling family incomes and the wealth gap is increasing to levels unseen since the Gilded Age of the late 19th century.&amp;nbsp; Health insurance?&amp;nbsp; Increasingly unaffordable and shifted back to the family and individual.&amp;nbsp; Educational costs?&amp;nbsp; Disproportionately expensive and with public funding cut back, costs borne more and more by the family and youth.&amp;nbsp; Retirement?&amp;nbsp; Likewise shifted back to the individual with an increasing reliance upon self&#45;funding via the IRA/401k.&amp;nbsp; The you can have it all mantra with which we were incubated in the consumer&#45;model system is now replaced by a painful and simple reality.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t.
This sea&#45;change is the truth with which we have to contend and which we will have to teach our children.&amp;nbsp; It is not, however, a truth that the economic and political establishment wishes to acknowledge.&amp;nbsp; Establishment mouthpieces such as the Wall Street Journal print missives to the American public telling them that they aren&#39;t doing their part as consumers.&amp;nbsp; Economists at the Federal Reserve publish studies about Americans not spending and slant their  phrasing phrasing negatively when they state that Americans are hoarding money.&amp;nbsp; When former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke to a group of high school educators, his choice of terminology was telling.&amp;nbsp; When he referenced teens, he referred to them as students and young people; when he referenced adults however, he predominantly used the term consumer with the implication that our job is to raise our young people to be consumers.&amp;nbsp; In the days immediately following the 9/11 attacks, then&#45;President George W. Bush even spoke to the American people and urged that they shouldn&#39;t let the terrorists win but should instead go back out and shop.&amp;nbsp; Seriously...shop?&amp;nbsp; So obviously, spending money matters.&amp;nbsp; Questioning the consumer model is a threat to the corporate profits that are directed to a smaller and smaller cadre of executives and investors that make up the high tier of the wealthy class.&amp;nbsp; Questioning this model is a threat to the profitable tenure and security of our elected and government officials, many of whom will exit government to cushy sinecures in the private sector.&amp;nbsp; Acknowledging this will require the public will for change that is a threat to the cancerous symbiosis between the corporate and political sectors that is, at its heart, fascism.
The rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as presidential contenders is a clear sign of the public pushback.&amp;nbsp; There are commonalities at the core of each movement that ultimately lead back to renewed opportunity for the individual and most importantly, sustainable, living&#45;wage jobs.&amp;nbsp; There are massive differences in how each candidate would hope to achieve these ends but when you cut through them, the heart of each pertains ultimately to trade, jobs and income.
This consumer&#45;driven economic model that we&#39;ve followed has been around for longer than the lifespan of most Americans and like anything, it will change and be replaced by something else.&amp;nbsp; That is at the heart of our present upset because nobody knows with what it should be replaced and such a real&#45;life process is neither as sterile nor academic as it would seem when written on a page.&amp;nbsp; What the Establishment seems to want is a perpetuation of the model even though they understand that it continues the hemorrhage of the American Middle&#45;Class until the. masses of our countrymen are reduced to a servitude of dead&#45;end jobs and interest payments.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s what they know and as the saying goes, if you give a monkey a hammer, then that&#39;s what it&#39;s going to use.&amp;nbsp; However, that doesn&#39;t square with the great mass of Americans who understand that something is badly amiss yet can&#39;t precisely enunciate what it is.
So here are the takeaways.
First, the Consumer&#45;Model economic driver of the past six&#45;plus decades is officially dead.&amp;nbsp; It has been killed by a combination of falling incomes on one side and competing demands for that same income on the other side.
Second, the Corporate/Political Establishment has a vested interest in perpetuating this dead model.&amp;nbsp; The Corporate because it allows money to be extracted from someone else &#45; the Consumer &#45; and redirected to them.&amp;nbsp; The Political because of unchecked campaign finance practices and a post&#45;political career revolving door into the lucrative corporate sector.
Third, we cannot assume that whatever replaces the consumer model is already pre&#45;ordained.&amp;nbsp; What we are witnessing with the utterly unexpected rise of Trump and Sanders are early salvos in a contest between this Establishment and the diverse citizenry.&amp;nbsp; If the Gilded Age is any example, it will be a contest that will last for decades.&amp;nbsp; That means that we have to remove our noses from Facebook pages and begin to think in the longer term.
Fourth, parents must begin to purposefully raise their children so that they aren&#39;t herded into a dead economic system that views them solely as prey.&amp;nbsp; We must be overt and direct in our conversations with them and we must likewise model an economic behavior of controlled consumption that is, for many of us, uncomfortably new.
We must become the first generation of Post&#45;Consumer Parents.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - April 2016:&nbsp; The Failure of QE</title>
<body>Frequently, compiling the monthly PracticalDad Price Index is less than exciting &#45; have you ever wondered how stupid you must look when you&#39;re on your knees checking a shelf label six inches from the floor? &#45; and the results can be dull.&amp;nbsp; But there are times when it is exciting, and the past number of months are a case in point.&amp;nbsp; Last evening&#39;s final calculation for April led to an audible sonuvabitch as I considered the number on the spreadsheet.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index result for the 47 item marketbasket dropped by more than a full basis point to an April level of 101.64 while the 37 foodstuff item Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index declined by almost one and a half basis points to an April level of 101.40.&amp;nbsp; What does this mean?&amp;nbsp; It means that everything that the Federal Reserve has tried to achieve with three rounds of Quantitative Easing, the trillions of dollars added to the money supply and their own balance sheet in an effort to spur inflation, is being utterly wiped away in abject failure.&amp;nbsp; Unless, of course, you&#39;re a hedge fund manager with assets in the market.&amp;nbsp;
The 47 item grocery marketbasket index began in November 2010 with a baseline index of 100 and through QE programs 2 and 3, the programs were able to induce a degree of mild inflation to offset the dread deflation.&amp;nbsp; But QE 3 ended at the end of October, 2014 and the 37 item foodstuff sub&#45;index subsequently peaked in December, 2014 &#45; only a month later &#45; with a sub&#45;index reading of 115.13 (again, November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; To purchase the same 37 foodstuff items more than four years after the outset of the Index would have cost 15.33% more at the peak.&amp;nbsp; And now?&amp;nbsp; Less than a year and a half later, with no QE, that has been almost wiped away and the indices are once again back where they were in the first quarter of 2011, only months after the start of QE 2.&amp;nbsp;
Take note of one particular element of the data listed below.&amp;nbsp; The final column is labelled Spread and is literally the differential between the Total Index and Food&#45;Only Subindex results.&amp;nbsp; For me, it&#39;s an indication of where the activity within the marketbasket is taking place, whether the 37 foodstuff items alone (for a breakdown of the items surveyed, see here) or whether there&#39;s more effect among the ten non&#45;foodstuff items such as soap, ibuprofen or trash bags.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve come to find is that the foodstuff segment of the Index is more sensitive to factors than the more stable 10 item non&#45;foodstuff segment.&amp;nbsp; Most of the rise in the Index has been fed by this more sensitive foodstuff segment and during the last months of the QE 3 program, the spread between the two was at times greater than three basis points with the Food&#45;Only Subindex leading.&amp;nbsp; But this month is only the third time in more than 65 months of consistent pricing that the Subindex trails; food led the way as an inflationary indicator and now it leads the way as a deflationary indicator.&amp;nbsp;
It shouldn&#39;t have been a surprise since the first part of the week brought a mailer from one of the surveyed supermarkets, which touted Thousands More Prices Just Dropped.&amp;nbsp; This market, along with the two surveyed competitors, have taken multiple steps in the past year to adjust to the economic environment of increased food stamp usage and diminished family incomes.&amp;nbsp; New suppliers have been found for their store brand offerings and cut&#45;rate products are now sitting on the shelves for the price&#45;conscious.&amp;nbsp; Yes, meat is still higher than it was at the outset years ago, but that kind of supply/demand imbalance brought about by decades&#45;low herd sizes doesn&#39;t end even remotely overnight.&amp;nbsp; It can be mitigated by factory techniques brought to the meatpacking industry and this is happening as more stores are now selling their 80% lean ground in factory&#45;packed plastic tubes called chubs.&amp;nbsp; Yes, more temporary supply dislocations brought about by factors such as avian flu can arise, but these resolve more quickly and the products, especially eggs, are lower in price than they were.&amp;nbsp; Yes, commodities such as sugar and coffee have suffered stealth inflation so that they&#39;re now sold in smaller containers, but even their prices have ebbed from their previous highs as the hot money of QE has ended.&amp;nbsp; But the problem of the diminished family income, further weighted by new claims upon it by higher education and healthcare costs, isn&#39;t so easily treated.&amp;nbsp; So the grocers do everything within their power to make their products more affordable so that they can compete and this bareknuckle price competition is symptomatic of deflation...brought about by a smaller money supply amongst the general public.
Which is perversely fascinating given all of the money that&#39;s been created by the Federal Reserve since the initial Quantitative Easing attempt began more than seven years ago.
This little datapoint of the prices at three unrelated grocery stores is fully related to the much larger issues being revealed by the chaos of the 2016 Presidential Electoral Process.&amp;nbsp; Massive amounts of money have been created out of whole cloth yet so little is reaching the general public that true deflation is being exhibited by the pricing and production behaviors of the grocers, as close to the first line of consumer spending as any line of business on the planet.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this political anger, fueled by unpopular trade policies and protracted military engagements that remove living&#45;wage jobs and detract from important public investment, that gives literal rise to the figurative middle fingers of both left and right of the political spectrum to the establishment mandarins.&amp;nbsp; Make no mistake about it, the anger from both sides is coming together as the divides are two sides of the same coin with the common element of anger directed at this government/corporate beast that we&#39;ve allowed to be created.
So what happens to the prices going forward?&amp;nbsp; While my guess is as good as anyone else&#39;s, the bet is that they&#39;ll continue to decline.&amp;nbsp; Some items are more expensive than they were five and a half years ago, but there will be enough offset elsewhere that the cost of purchasing a marketbasket of the same items will actually be cheaper than they were at the outset.&amp;nbsp; Unless they either re&#45;institute another round of QE &#45; which would be disastrous without fundamental changes to the existing system that&#39;s already created such divisions of wealth and class &#45; or find a way to promote the creation of sustainable, living wage jobs, then the hemorrhaging and deflation will continue.&amp;nbsp; So, here are the indices for the past six months.

<title>Kids, Socialism and the Communist Manifesto (Really&#8230;)</title>
<body>The conversation occurred one evening when Middle was home from college on break.&amp;nbsp; Given the political primaries occurring shortly, it naturally pertained to politics and where we stood on the issues.&amp;nbsp; But as the time passed, the discussion widened from specific issues and candidates to one of more general political leanings and it was here that I learned that Middle was now classifying himself as a Democratic Socialist cut from the European mold.&amp;nbsp; He likewise noted that many of his peers and friends now were leaning in that general direction and it was certainly in sync with the recent article that</body>

<title>Driving Up the Cost of Higher Ed:&nbsp; Bette and the New Educational Baseline</title>
<body>Before he departed for his freshman year in college, Middle and I were talking about student debt and the high cost of a college degree.&amp;nbsp; He looked at me and asked &quot;How in the hell did this happen?&quot;&amp;nbsp; This article is the third in a series that tries to make sense of what in the hell did happen to so disproportionately ratchet up the costs of higher education.
The cost of a degree didn&#39;t just skyrocket willy&#45;nilly over the course of decades, much as the shuttle Challenger didn&#39;t just explode and the Titanic didn&#39;t just sink.&amp;nbsp; In each instance, there were a variety of reasons that came together to set the stage for the events in question by guaranteeing that higher education now had a far more massive demand for its services than ever existed previously in American history.&amp;nbsp; In terms of the demand for higher education, the first factor was globalization and the knowledge&#45;based economy.&amp;nbsp; The theory was that the lower&#45;end and unpleasant manufacturing would be farmed out overseas and the Americans would, in their wisdom and foresight (and for those with Asperger&#39;s, this is sarcasm), keep the higher&#45;end technical manufacturing, administrative and service functions here.&amp;nbsp;  The second factor &#45; and the one that we&#39;ll explore here &#45; is also business&#45;related:&amp;nbsp; starting in the 1970s and afterwards, the business community shifted the educational baseline for employment from the high school diploma to the college degree.
A reasonable part of the shift during the last quarter of the twentieth century was objective.&amp;nbsp; The baseline for academic performance &#45; rightly or wrongly &#45; is the SAT and since the the Golden Era of the 1960s, the average SAT scores on both the verbal and math components had dropped consistently.&amp;nbsp;  There was also continuing criticism of the public school system and its apparent inability to prepare young people to compete in the workplace.&amp;nbsp; No, folks, what we discuss today has been around in one form or another for decades.&amp;nbsp; American business through the 1970s and 1980s was in the process of having its lunch eaten by the Japanese and Germans and entire industries were simply being destroyed.&amp;nbsp; Remember the textile industry?&amp;nbsp; Foreign competition was hungrier and the sense was that the former Axis powers had lost the Second World War but were well into the process of winning the peace.&amp;nbsp; Given these factors, the push was on in the business world to recruit more and more college graduates to work instead of those with potentially suspect high school diplomas.&amp;nbsp; Hey, our high schoolers might be idiots but the good ones go through the still&#45;respected college system and are ready to roll in the workforce was the attitude.&amp;nbsp; If you are old enough to recall the stories about Ford Pintos catching fire and Chrysler employees sending cars out the factory doors with empty bottles rattling around inside the car doors, it actually made sense.&amp;nbsp; This gave the kids another four years to mature and gain a better education in preparation for the world.
But increasing global competitiveness wasn&#39;t the only reason that businesses shifted their baselines upwards.&amp;nbsp; The other reason was simply a question of cosmetics and I was privileged to be intimately acquainted with two separate instances of cosmetic baseline changes.&amp;nbsp; The first instance was cosmetic in terms of appearance to other businesses.&amp;nbsp; My first real job was when an employer hired me as part of its first group of college&#45;educated &quot;professional&quot; hires for a particular operational area.&amp;nbsp; It was the job that actually paid me enough money to allow myself to move out of the family household, where I&#39;d lived for a year after my own college graduation and it pertained to ceded reinsurance.&amp;nbsp; You can certainly refer back to the link, but the best real&#45;world example is that of a bookie laying off bets with other bookies so that he isn&#39;t wiped out should that million&#45;to&#45;one shot actually pay off.&amp;nbsp; Many insurance policies were written with reinsurance provisions that allowed a company with a large loss to be reimbursed by other companies and it was my job, along with the others, to review all of these losses and first ascertain if a reinsurance provision existed, then determine the amount to be billed and finally to get the money back from them.&amp;nbsp; It is an arcane, technical arena of insurance and the hubs for such work are all in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Munich, Atlanta and London.&amp;nbsp; My hire came about because the operations director for my new employer had looked around and noticed that everyone with whom his department interacted to retrieve the monies had, at the minimum, a bachelor&#39;s degree and in his mind, they&#39;d be more willing to pay if they had faith in the competence of the people doing the billing.&amp;nbsp; It made sense cosmetically.&amp;nbsp; But the reality was that with adequate training, the job didn&#39;t actually require a college degree as much as the capacity to focus and a simple willingness to learn and this was something that the majority of the existing non&#45;college staff had in abundance.&amp;nbsp; We new hires did have to undergo two full weeks of classroom training before the director even allowed us onto the floor to shadow our non&#45;degreed trainers and to say that it was uncomfortable was an understatement.&amp;nbsp; The demand for a degree was further fueled when these same staffers were told that if they wanted to go anywhere else within the company at or above their pay&#45;grade, they would now require a college degree.
The second instance of a cosmetic baseline change was to demonstrate perceived competence to prospective customers, even if the job again didn&#39;t require a college degree.&amp;nbsp; Hey, we&#39;re better!&amp;nbsp; Our people have college degrees!&amp;nbsp; I left the reinsurance position to move to a smaller city where my better half was in school.&amp;nbsp; There was no hope of another reinsurance job but I managed to swing another hire as a commercial claims adjuster for a regional insurance carrier.&amp;nbsp; It is a mystery greater than the disappearance of Amelia Earhart that the claims manager and supervisor actually hired me since I had no actual experience doing this and simply had to learn on the spot, absorbing information and settling claims across a spectrum of insurance lines &#45; workers&#39; compensation, commercial and auto liability.&amp;nbsp; But it was also another uncomfortable situation since that company had instituted a college&#45;degree requirement for all claims adjusters.&amp;nbsp; That meant that any future hires into adjusting positions had to be college graduates and that any future promotion for an adjuster was predicated upon the completion of a degree; another increase in the aggregate demand for a degree.&amp;nbsp; Because I didn&#39;t receive the home office training received by new hires with a degree, I was literally dependent upon the goodwill of those around me, most especially those non&#45;degreed adjusters now locked into a position.&amp;nbsp; When one of these adjusters &#45; Bette &#45; asked me to help clarify her purported confusion about a liability case, I agreed to do so and then smuggled the file out of the office to study it that evening to find the appropriate response.&amp;nbsp; When I gave her my response the following morning, I passed her test.
Bette was the perfect microcosm for the debate on whether a degree was truly necessary.&amp;nbsp; A claims adjuster is the person who proverbially walks behind cleaning up after the elephant parade; the adjuster is dealing with those who have had a loss and it&#39;s not uncommon to take undeserved heat arising from misplaced anger.&amp;nbsp; The questions that arise also beg answers that don&#39;t come from calculators:&amp;nbsp; How do you compensate someone for damage to an arm or leg?&amp;nbsp; Does a person who is considered ugly deserve less for a scar than someone who isn&#39;t considered ugly?&amp;nbsp; How much does someone deserve for pain and suffering?&amp;nbsp; It was Bette&#39;s handling of a particular case that taught me a life lesson in assessing value, detail and negotiation.&amp;nbsp; Our insured store&#39;s security had publicly and wrongly detained an African&#45;American educator in a neighborhood store for alleged shoplifting, immediately afterwards releasing him when the manager realized his innocence.&amp;nbsp; A claim was filed for wrongful detention and the insured wanted to see it negotiated promptly so as to avoid a publicly humiliating trial.&amp;nbsp; The case was assigned to Bette and she visited the educator and his wife, departing their home with the skeleton of what became a mutually satisfactory settlement after only the first visit.&amp;nbsp; What she noticed on the visit was a variety of travel magazines on the coffee and end tables and she used that as a departure point for cordial conversation.&amp;nbsp; After they began to discuss their claim, it became the segue to a settlement when she tied a potential amount to the cost of a vacation in their dream locale.&amp;nbsp; The upshot was that the couple happily had a two week vacation for considerably less than a possible jury verdict.&amp;nbsp; This case demonstrated more than anything that the college degree was utterly irrelevant to performance of the job at hand.&amp;nbsp; There was nothing about 120 credits of academia that could have successfully concluded this case, or almost any other for that matter.&amp;nbsp; What was required for a successful career was simply native intelligence, good people skills and an acute ability to observe.
There is a time and a place for higher education.&amp;nbsp; I want my bridge&#45;builder and aircraft designer to have a good basis in engineering, which can only come from concentrated study.&amp;nbsp; I want my Family Practitioner and medical researcher to likewise have skills that only arise from concentrated study.&amp;nbsp; But the simple reality is that we&#39;ve allowed ourselves to be told that the only route to financial success is via a college degree and business hiring has now cast that into cement and again, the only winner is the institution of higher education.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - March 2016:&nbsp; The Human Face of Deflation</title>
<body>The data is collected and calculated for the March 2016 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index and once again, the Index has declined as deflation now roars through the grocery stores.&amp;nbsp; The PracticalDad Index marketbasket consists of 47 items from a standard grocery store that are commonly purchased by a family on a budget.&amp;nbsp; These items compose the Total Index and for March 2016, the Total Index for this marketbasket was 102.86 (November 2010 = 100.00) and was down a full basis point from February&#39;s level of 103.86.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Subindex is composed of the 37 foodstuff items within the basket and in March was actually less, at 102.85 (November 2010 = 100.00) and declined by a considerable 1.42 basis points from February&#39;s Subindex reading of 104.27.&amp;nbsp;
Let&#39;s put this into perspective.&amp;nbsp; The PracticalDad Price Index began in November 2010 as a kitchen&#45;table project to ascertain what was actually happening to food prices on a family level.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Reserve had commenced the first of three efforts at Quantitative Easing, an untried and novel approach to kickstart economic activity by flooding the financial system with liquidity.&amp;nbsp; The QE programs were the brainchild of the then&#45;chairman Ben Bernanke, an economics professor whose academic expertise lay in the errors of his Great Depression era predecessors in the effort to fend off the deflation that laid waste to the global economy.&amp;nbsp; It was only natural that such an untried policy approach gave rise to immense debate over it&#39;s ultimate impact and whether it would fail, create the unicorn&#45;like moderated inflation of 2% or tear the economy a new one that spewed a raging storm of inflation.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, good times...&amp;nbsp; But for all of the conversation about isolated items rising or falling in price, or the closely followed CPI, how would this play out in the marketbasket composed of items purchased by the common American family?&amp;nbsp; And so the PracticalDad Price Index was born.&amp;nbsp;
So in five years and trillions of dollars created and injected into the Financial system by the Federal Reserve via three separate QE programs, what has been the result?&amp;nbsp; From the period of November 2010 to November 2015, the Federal Reserve more than doubled the asset holdings on its balance sheet, seeing an increase from approximately $3 Trillion to $7 Trillion while the DJIA during the period of November 2010 to March 2016 rose by 60%, from 11124 to 17829.&amp;nbsp; The gap between the uber&#45;wealthy and the average American increased in terms of amount of assets owned</body>

<title>On Being Sandwiched</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As we were, so you are.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As we are, so you will be.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &#45; Sign in the crypt of the Capuchin Order, Rome, Italy
You see some odd things as you travel and one of the oddest is the crypt of the Capuchin Friars in Rome.&amp;nbsp; It is a multi&#45;room collection of the bones &#45; some still full skeletons &#45; of more than 3700 Capuchin Friars and others, assembled in various displays that in some ways are morbidly artistic.&amp;nbsp; The captioned quote is on a sign in one of the rooms and serves as a graphic reminder to the tourist of the fleeting nature of life.&amp;nbsp; I saw the sign during a family vacation several years ago and noticing it served as the cherry on a thoroughly bizarre day.&amp;nbsp; But the full import was lost on me until I became sandwiched between the youngsters and an elderly parent.
For most people, life is a Bell Curve and the plateau for the total person &#45; mental, physical, emotional &#45; is typically reached during middle age.&amp;nbsp; When you have kids, you&#39;re at or near the top of your game and can focus on raising them, bringing them along and preparing them for their own adulthood.&amp;nbsp; It is hard work, as the Wall Street Journal noted in a groundbreaking article some years ago &#45; seriously, when I first read the article years ago, I actually looked at the title and exclaimed &quot;well, duh&quot; &#45; and when you have more than one young child, the work explodes on a seemingly exponential level.&amp;nbsp; But that work is also played out against a backdrop of anticipation, hope, love and at times, pure joy.&amp;nbsp; But there will come a time when the Bell Curve starts to slope downwards and while you are still approaching, at, or near the plateau, your own parents will start to descend that slope.&amp;nbsp; The parent&#39;s decline can be gradual and it certainly doesn&#39;t occur across all the phases &#45; mental, emotional, physical &#45; of the person.&amp;nbsp; But there can and probably will come a time when there&#39;s a break in the elder parent&#39;s descent and it goes beyond the capacity of one or both parents to manage it in the moment.&amp;nbsp; Falls that once would have left a bruise now leave a break and if the parent is sufficiently elderly, the break can create a cascade effect flowing further to the downside.&amp;nbsp; Middle&#45;aged moments of forgetting what you needed from upstairs become senior moments of forgetting to turn off a gas range or even where you live when you take a walk.&amp;nbsp; These are the situations that bring the phone calls soliciting help from the elders and lead to an entirely new dimension of adulthood:&amp;nbsp; parenting your own parent.
The slang term for the situation is being sandwiched because of the pressure that&#39;s felt from being responsible for both sides.&amp;nbsp; While it makes sense on one level, it&#39;s also deceptive.&amp;nbsp;  What&#39;s really happening is that you&#39;re simultaneously being stretched as the demands of each surrounding generation pull you in one direction and then in another.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;ve waited to have children until you&#39;re older, then the stretch is even more pronounced as you might find yourself visiting both pediatrician and geriatrician in the same week.&amp;nbsp; Trying to juggle making an appointment for the kid with the work schedule?&amp;nbsp; Now toss in having to make an appointment for your infirm father and the tension from the stretch becomes palpable.&amp;nbsp; As the American family has gone nuclear and mobile, creating physical distance between the adult generations, the response has been a budding growth industry for assisting the elderly when the adult children are absent.&amp;nbsp; The elderly with sufficient assets can enter full&#45;spectrum retirement communities able to meet their needs as they age; the parents can purchase a cottage and if and when the need arises, they can then shift to an apartment and later, be assured of a bed in assisted&#45;living or skilled care.&amp;nbsp; Want to stay at home?&amp;nbsp; Purchase a chairlift for the stairs or modify the bathtub to account for increasing issues with balance.&amp;nbsp; Hire a person to come visit for periods of time to combat the cumulative effects of isolation upon the mental faculties.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s a downside to this however and my wife noted it, in of all places, a commercial for Priceline.com.&amp;nbsp; The gist of the commercial was that another market segment for discount travel was for those who needed to get to elderly relatives quickly and inexpensively, because emergencies don&#39;t allow the luxury of planning six months ahead for the best rates.&amp;nbsp; In the commercial, an elderly woman was hiring someone to do repair work and the contractor was then coaxing her out of her social security number.&amp;nbsp; That came on the heels of a recent phone conversation between my wife and her own mother, who&#39;d related how an upset elderly neighbor had visited, frustrated that she had allowed herself to divulge her bank account information and number to an unknown person on the phone.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to necessarily imply that all businesses oriented towards the elder market are shady, because they aren&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; But it is a real and added concern for the adult children because they don&#39;t want to see their parents manipulated and gulled.
There is a common factor amongst the previous two paragraphs and it&#39;s one of which I am highly mindful as I look ahead:&amp;nbsp; assets.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve predicated our family structure and society upon a model that requires assets for optimal performance.&amp;nbsp; Americans are living longer and encountering aging issues that didn&#39;t exist before simply because people died before they could reach the point at which the issues became relevant in the aggregate.&amp;nbsp; But the American family isn&#39;t in the same situation as it was during our grandparent&#39;s generation.&amp;nbsp; The costs of healthcare and higher education are disproportionately higher relative to family income than two decades ago, yet the family and individual now must bear a greater burden than before...and on a family income that is, in the aggregate, declining.&amp;nbsp; The private assets simply aren&#39;t there to support such a model for more than another generation and it&#39;s already leading to generational warfare between the likes of AARP and the Millenials as squabbling begins for the allocation of public assets.&amp;nbsp; While raising children can bring the emotions of anticipation, hope and joy, what I honestly feel as I look forward isn&#39;t tension, but foreboding.&amp;nbsp; On a personal level, is this something I can expect?&amp;nbsp; Debility and dementia?&amp;nbsp; Frustration and fear because I might be increasingly incapable of navigating a technological system that&#39;s opaque to an elder American for its complexity?&amp;nbsp; Hell, I have difficulty figuring out the new smartphone already...what&#39;s going to happen when I&#39;m three&#45;quarters deaf and expected to walk through an automated phone registration system for some program or another?&amp;nbsp; As my late grandmother used to say, being old ain&#39;t for sissies.
That leads to the last aspect of being stretched.&amp;nbsp; The model for aging in America will have to change and as we grope our way forward to whatever that new model is going to be, it&#39;s incumbent upon me to figure out how to model an appropriate behavior upon which my own children can draw as they move into adulthood.&amp;nbsp; My own parents dealt with their parents from a nuclear family&#39;s distance of 225 miles, although one parent had a sibling nearby to her mother.&amp;nbsp; Until the bitter end, it was managed via phone calls and the occasional visit to handle business and it&#39;s not terribly far removed from the way that many of their peers managed as well.&amp;nbsp; But the stresses of American society are such that it&#39;s not so operative anymore and it will be better for all involved if the kids are more closely attuned to their parents&#39; situation, even if they aren&#39;t necessarily living down the street.&amp;nbsp; How often can I make medical appointments?&amp;nbsp; How do I honor a parent&#39;s desire for independence and yet assure safety for the parent and others?&amp;nbsp; What arrangements must I make if I&#39;m responsible yet want to take a week vacation with the family?&amp;nbsp; How do I manage my own frustrations as ancient issues resurface after decades of living on my own as an adult?&amp;nbsp; What must I do to prepare so that I can be on good relations and make their own way easier as they eventually move into this role?
I&#39;m a parameters guy.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s any one perfect way of addressing any situation.&amp;nbsp; You determine the parameters within which you have to work and then figure out a mechanism that&#39;s best for the given set of parameters and even then, it&#39;s not going to be perfect.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;m mindful that the parameters within which our country has operated are changing and doing so rapidly and that simply is creating additional pressure because we&#39;re now in the position of not just being sandwiched between generations, but being sandwiched between systems.</body>

<title>Technology, Fairness and Kids</title>
<body>It&#39;s not fair!&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s just not fair!
Almost all of us with kids have heard this phrase from their mouths at one time or another, especially if the child has a sibling.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been a chronic complaint for generations of parents as the egocentric kids worry that Sib is getting more than they are, whether it&#39;s a smartphone, an Easy&#45;Bake oven, a Hula hoop or a Dick Tracy detective kit.&amp;nbsp; And the response of most parents is a sigh or groan and an explanation that the Sib is really not being treated preferentially.&amp;nbsp; But does this age&#45;old situation taken on a new face?&amp;nbsp; Has the technology curve changed how we handle the concept of fairness and equity with the kids and how do we manage it?
From talking with my peers over the years, the common recollection was that most parents tried to maintain an almost mechanistic even&#45;handedness in dealing with the kids.&amp;nbsp; Like my own parents, if one child got a real desk at 10 years of age, then the next child received the same item at the same age.&amp;nbsp; It was a realistic defense in dealing with the kvetching that comes from kids sensitive to anything that threatens their own perceived place in the world.&amp;nbsp; And if anything can drive a parent batshit crazy, it&#39;s the constant grousing from one or more of the kids who chronically attempt to prove their point, as pointless as it may be.&amp;nbsp; My own history was one of the mechanistic even&#45;handed sort.&amp;nbsp; My older sister got some milestone item at a specific age and when I reached that same age a few years later, I received a like milestone item.&amp;nbsp; Desk?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; Decent bicycle?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; With many of my peers, it was a similar situation because typically, a kid didn&#39;t need a specific item until there was actually a perceptible need for it.&amp;nbsp;
While my wife and I worked with this process through the early years of our children&#39;s lives, it has taken a decidedly different turn in the past several months because of technology, specifically laptops and smartphones.&amp;nbsp; Until a few years ago, the family line was that there would be one family computer for the kids to share and that device was located in a common area of the house.&amp;nbsp; None of the kids had laptops that could be removed to bedrooms and there were no smartphones; the word on mobile phones was that when circumstance dictated it, then a child got a cellphone.&amp;nbsp; When Eldest was fifteen years of age and traveling to a distant city for a week&#45;long event, we got her a cellphone.&amp;nbsp; As her high school graduation gift, we footed a nice, high&#45;end laptop that would last through college.&amp;nbsp; Several years after Eldest blazed the way, Middle got a cellphone just before he was eligible to drive.&amp;nbsp; His laptop however, was earlier since the school decreed that all students would receive free laptops for use and lo and behold, a laptop appeared years before we had planned to foot for one and household guidelines had to be revised accordingly.&amp;nbsp; When the school district redrew boundary lines for the various schools to rebalance the size of their respective student bodies, we found that Youngest would be attending middle school at the school that was the further away so he got a simple cellphone for use in case or emergency; this was at an age several years younger than his siblings.
But the push has been on for months about upgrading to a better phone and by better, I mean a smartphone.&amp;nbsp; The repeated requests have been at Youngest&#39;s behest because his simple phone is incapable of handling the communications now used by his peers, all of whom possess one manner of smartphone or another.&amp;nbsp; As one of his buddies commented, Dude, you should get an Apple...we&#39;re an Apple family!&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve found that some of his friends will text with him simply because they&#39;re friends but he&#39;s the only one with whom they text and all else is handled via Instagram; this means that in oversight, there have been multiple events and get&#45;togethers from which he&#39;s been excluded and despite subsequent apologies from his buddies, it still hurts.&amp;nbsp; This realization has led to more discussion in the household.&amp;nbsp; Should we let the fact that he&#39;s the only one without the latest and greatest drive a family decision?&amp;nbsp; What are the new family guidelines on smartphone use?&amp;nbsp; How fair is it to the older siblings that he&#39;s received earlier access to technology and in some instances, by years?&amp;nbsp; Because Eldest was home visiting from college over a recent weekend, she responded that it was really irrelevant now.&amp;nbsp; The communication platforms favored by the youngsters &#45; even younger than the college crowd &#45; has changed significantly from when she was that age less than a decade before and if it was interfering with his capability to have a healthy and active social life with his peers, then it was worth the upgrade.&amp;nbsp; To be fully equitable however, we also upgraded Middle to a smartphone and as a favor to me, my wife also got me one as well.
So technological change has altered the question of maintaining a degree of fairness amongst the children.&amp;nbsp; What we&#39;ve seen is that the other factor which makes it more pertinent is the age differential between the various children.&amp;nbsp; If you have only a few years between the children, then the matter won&#39;t be a potential booby&#45;trap.&amp;nbsp; But if you&#39;re talking anywhere around the vicinity of five or more years between the kids, then it&#39;s liable to be more of a concern.&amp;nbsp; There are no right or wrong answers here.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s worthwhile to be aware of the trip hazards as you negotiate the debate.</body>

<title>Dystopia Comes Home</title>
<body>Teen and young adult dystopian literature has been around for a while but it&#39;s darkly fascinating to see how the notion that something&#39;s just not quite right is percolating through society.&amp;nbsp; So it was when I was chatting with Youngest one evening about his school day and found that he had an essay due along with the rest of his middle school English class.&amp;nbsp; The topic was both surprising and more than a little disturbing:&amp;nbsp; each student was to describe the one skill that they&#39;d most prize should the economy collapse and things go to hell (my term, not his).&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve known for a while that teens are feeling stress as acutely as adults and that their stress is timed to the school year.&amp;nbsp; The push for good grades and to ascertain what their career goals &#45; not to mention getting into and funding the right school &#45; make their teen years significantly more tense than it probably was two or three generations ago.&amp;nbsp; But throw in the refrain that a college degree has now supplanted the high school diploma as the baseline paper for some degree of financial success and the understanding that they&#39;re likely to graduate with the equivalent car loan around their neck for a barista&#39;s position, and they get it.&amp;nbsp; The question that it begs afterwards is how long this condition can last; more importantly, what happens to society afterwards?&amp;nbsp; So their literature has come to mirror adult literature with authors tapping into the zeitgeist to work through the issues.&amp;nbsp; Teens have seen their fictional societies ravaged by despotic regimes (Suzanne Collins&#39; The Hunger Games), aliens (Rick Yancey&#39;s The Fifth Wave), nuclear post&#45;apocolyptic societies (Veronica Roth&#39;s Divergent series), and zombies (James Dashner&#39;s Maze Runner and Charlie Higson&#39;s The Enemy series).&amp;nbsp; Having seen each of these series come through the household with one child or another, I can only ask myself what else could possibly go wrong?&amp;nbsp;
But this particular essay assignment doesn&#39;t have the Shakespearean suspend your disbelief quality that all of the previously mentioned series share.&amp;nbsp; This has an immediacy that touches them deeply.&amp;nbsp; Youngest&#39;s generation is a group that has seen parents downsized and has seen a suburban school district host clothing drives each year, an event that didn&#39;t exist until just a few years ago.&amp;nbsp; A nearby city school district has a Friday power&#45;pack program that hands out hundreds of food&#45;filled backpacks to students so that they have food for the weekend and don&#39;t return to school the following Monday suffering from hunger.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t fiction and this isn&#39;t unbelievable.&amp;nbsp; For them, this is real.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know what the teacher&#39;s thought process was behind the assignment and I don&#39;t know if that individual is a closet doomer or just looking to spur thought; I frankly don&#39;t plan to bother finding out.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s still an eye&#45;opening assignment.
So as Youngest and I spoke, I inquired as to what his response was and after sharing it with me, we talked further about it.&amp;nbsp; My own comments afterwards were to what I myself would consider the most important skill set and not surprisingly, it had to do with the ability to determine what holds value for people and then knowing how to negotiate and barter.&amp;nbsp; Because if the s*&amp;^ hits the fan as the phrase goes, money will rapidly disappear and we&#39;ll be working on a barter basis.&amp;nbsp; The conversation ranged to the highly practical &#45; and cynical &#45; view of human nature and that perhaps the family&#39;s stash of alcohol could be divvied into smaller containers for trade or supplemented with airline bottles.&amp;nbsp; It might even be of benefit to further supplement the stash with a supply of cartons of cigarettes for trade.&amp;nbsp; Is it an optimal outlook?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; But this type of scenario is going to require a pragmatic and clear view of the world around us, very different from what out youngsters have come to expect in their politically correct school cocoons.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s been an interesting thought experiment in the days since that conversation.&amp;nbsp; If there is an economic collapse &#45; and the constant 24/7 newscycle feeds that fear &#45; what should you expect?&amp;nbsp; What do you believe that would resemble and more importantly, what is your plan?&amp;nbsp; How would you plan to handle the first several weeks if there&#39;s a Greek/Cypriot style clampdown on bank ATMs or even a wholesale bank holiday?&amp;nbsp; Who is in your network of close friends upon whom you rely and in turn rely upon you?&amp;nbsp; Most importantly, what and how do you teach your children so that they can make their way as self&#45;reliant and capable adults in such a world?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not a theoretical question but goes to the heart of being a parent since our primary job is to raise the children to become self&#45;reliant, productive and moral adults capable of making their way in the world.&amp;nbsp;
I doubt that my conversation about bartering booze and smokes necessarily fits into the category of moral, but it can help get through the immediate crisis period while we work on the other skills that would serve them better in the long&#45;haul.&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s also part of our parental purview to help them determine what those skills are and how to foster them along.&amp;nbsp; So make an effort to prompt them on their days and their assignments.&amp;nbsp; The results can be more revealing than another piece of classwork designed solely to get them through the next standardized test.&amp;nbsp; And a note to myself &#45; get a final copy of Youngest&#39;s essay from his teacher.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s going to be an interesting read.</body>

<title>So, Who Do You Like?</title>
<body>The question about the upcoming presidential primaries for the 2016 nominees has arisen on both end of the spectrums, from one of the kids as well as from my mother, who popped it during a lunch the other day.&amp;nbsp; So, who do you like?
While it would be a beautiful thing to be able to spit out a response in favor of a singular candidate &#45; because it&#39;s just time for a woman president, that&#39;s why &#45; I find that it&#39;s difficult.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that the issue overshadowing all else is the control that the uber&#45;wealthy and corporations now have over the legislative and electoral process.&amp;nbsp; And by uber&#45;wealthy, I mean those who have .01% of the nation&#39;s wealth...welcome back to the age of the Robber Barons.&amp;nbsp;
So the question arose again the other night where two of the three kids were gathered with us awaiting Middle&#39;s event.&amp;nbsp; Both my wife and I looked at one another and the statements were identical and concise:&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t matter.&amp;nbsp; Taxes will go up regardless of who&#39;s in office and Sanders is the only one with the guts to acknowledge that that&#39;s going to happen.&amp;nbsp; But if Trump makes his way into office, don&#39;t be surprised if they increase there either since it&#39;s a mathematical certainty that the revenue will only flow if the taxes go up...because God knows we can&#39;t control our spending.&amp;nbsp; We both elaborated further, knowing that the problems are wholly systemic and metastasized throughout the governmental body.&amp;nbsp; If you want to know the truth, the ideal candidate is already resigned to the notion that it will be a single term presidency and he/she will lose, if even willing to run for a second term.&amp;nbsp; Because the system will have to be shaken to the core and if successful, that President will be hated and derided and probably for a generation.&amp;nbsp; To call it a sobering commentary would be an understatement.
Here&#39;s the thing behind the commentary.&amp;nbsp; Twain wrote that while history doesn&#39;t repeat itself, it does rhyme and we&#39;re now in a literal nursery rhyme with Andrew Jackson&#39;s clash with Nicholas Biddle&#39;s Second Bank of the United States.&amp;nbsp; In that instance, Biddle put the screws to the country by betraying its role as the ostensible central bank and withholding funds from smaller banks in order to pressure the Congress to renew their original charter.&amp;nbsp; This resulted in multiple small bank runs with the resultant ruin of thousands of depositors who lost all of their savings; but it also dramatized the threat that one or a few exceptionally wealthy and powerful individuals could pose to the body politic.&amp;nbsp; In that instance, Jackson&#39;s response &#45; combative and populist &#45; was to withdraw the government&#39;s deposits from Biddle&#39;s bank, which served as the capital base for all that that bank was supposed to do.&amp;nbsp; In essence, Jackson allowed the financial system to collapse in order to save the promise of the still very young Constitution.&amp;nbsp; To do otherwise would have been to allow a single individual to use the power of the pre&#45;eminent financial institution to gain control over the mechanism of government.&amp;nbsp; If Jackson folded and Biddle won, what else would have happened &#45; or not happened &#45; if it displeased the banker.
And with the Supreme Court&#39;s 2010 Citizens United decision that effectively quashed any campaign finance reform, please feel free to explain to me how this is any different from 180 years ago?
Some years ago, I used to spend considerable time on a wonderful financial/economics site and in the course of an evening&#39;s ongoing commentary with other members of that community, I commented this:&amp;nbsp; My hope is that when all of this is said and done, we come through everything with some semblance of an intact Constitution.&amp;nbsp; It sounds melodramatic, which I hate, but it&#39;s not at all far&#45;fetched.&amp;nbsp; The levers of power have been grabbed by the very wealthiest few and the corporations and they are actively solidifying their hold on said levers.&amp;nbsp; President Obama&#39;s response in his first term should have been Jacksonian, moving to reform and re&#45;institute meaningful regulation of the financial sector and he failed to do this.&amp;nbsp; That an Assistant Attorney General was canned and his then&#45;Attorney General later acknowledged that the fear of financial damage to the economy affects decisions on prosecutions indicates the level of power of that sector and the fear that it engenders.&amp;nbsp; And now that the heads of JPM Chase and Goldman Sachs have both become certifiable billionaires under this arrangement, the financial sector is wholly part and parcel of the cabal.
The threat to the country is no longer economic but now, for all intents and purposes, both Constitutional and existential.&amp;nbsp; My thinking had been that the key factor to my choice of candidate would be what kind of person they&#39;d likely nominate to the Supreme Court and how that individual would vote on such a decision as Citizens United.&amp;nbsp; That decision was reached by the narrowest margin of 5 &#45; 4 and the dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens &#45; eminently worthy of the read here &#45; is a good distillation of the ultimate controversy:&amp;nbsp; with whom does the power reside?&amp;nbsp; I have become convinced that the trade and monetary policies of the past three decades have been purposefully passed with the understanding that they will ultimately benefit only a relative very few and that, at the cost of the great majority of Americans.&amp;nbsp; The hemorrhaging of the median family income isn&#39;t a sudden event, but instead only the damage arising from the effects of three decades of cumulative muggings upon the American Middle Class.&amp;nbsp; Such is the effect of power moving to the control of a very self&#45;interested few.&amp;nbsp;
My thinking about the candidate that I&#39;d support went to the type of individual that would be nominated to the Supreme Court.&amp;nbsp; What would be the political persuasion and most importantly, their attitudes about the Constitution?&amp;nbsp; Strict constructionist?&amp;nbsp; Liberal?&amp;nbsp; It does matter because as much as I can appreciate the constructionist viewpoint, the reality is that we have issues today that would make our Founding Fathers&#39; eyes bleed.&amp;nbsp; Some things are the same, yet some are simply not.
At the end of the evening, we found out that Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away earlier that day and the narrow majority that ruled in favor of the Citizens United decision was now moot.&amp;nbsp; I was unaware of Scalia&#39;s age and believed that the decision to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice would wait until the next president but that assumption is now moot.&amp;nbsp; It is the purview of any sitting President to nominate a person for the Supreme Court and for either side to cry for a delay is politics at its most venal.&amp;nbsp; But make no mistake, with the average age of the Supreme Court north of 70 years of age, it&#39;s likely that the next President will also have the privilege of nominating a candidate.&amp;nbsp; If President Obama does nominate someone who would shift that 5 &#45; 4 margin in the direction favorable to overturning the Citizens United decision, it would still be only a razor thin majority.&amp;nbsp; So that&#39;s what I&#39;m considering as both sides of the political spectrum continue to throw the middle finger at the political class.&amp;nbsp; Do I have a list of candidates for the Court should Trump, Sanders, Hillary or anybody else take office?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;m not stupid either, and what they say &#45; and how much money that they take &#45; is a solid indication of where they&#39;ll go.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s likely to be where I&#39;ll head, too.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - February 2016:&nbsp; Bare-Knuckle Price Fighting&#8230;</title>
<body>The pricing for the February 2016 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index is in with deflation in the 47 item grocery market&#45;basket continuing.&amp;nbsp; As I sat there researching background information to understand something, it occurred that what we&#39;re watching in the retail economy is best described as bare knuckled price fighting.&amp;nbsp; There was a time when grocery stores were adding upscale coffee kiosks and organic produce sections to entice customers, but that&#39;s now in the past as stores are finding new ways to fight for the disappearing consumer dollar and it&#39;s creating a feedback loop for deflation.&amp;nbsp; But first, the numbers from this most recent monthly pricing and then some comments both about what I&#39;m seeing on the shelves and how this is impacting the Index.
The Total Index reading on the 47 item PracticalDad Price Index for February 2016 came in at 103.86 (November 2010 = 100), down from January&#39;s 104.54.&amp;nbsp; The 37 food&#45;stuff components sub&#45;index for February was 104.27 (November 2010 = 100), likewise down almost a full basis point from January&#39;s result of 105.25.&amp;nbsp; For the Food&#45;only Subindex, this most recent result of 104.27 is fully 70% less than the high&#45;point of that sub&#45;index; it reached a maximum of 115.13 in December 2014 and has declined since that time.&amp;nbsp;
So there you have it.&amp;nbsp; More than a half decade of artificially low rates pushing the zero&#45;rate boundary to spur inflation and all of those trillions of dollars of additional liquidity wiped away in the fourteen months since that peak.&amp;nbsp; Fourteen months and the aggregate pricing is now back at a level unseen since the summer of 2011.&amp;nbsp; A pound of hamburger and a package of hot dogs are still more expensive than at the outset of the survey in November 2010, as are some other food items, but it&#39;s what has occurred with other items that provide a good explanation of deflation and what&#39;s occurring within the greater economy.
What&#39;s accounting for the ongoing deflation?&amp;nbsp; Simply put, the grocers are doing everything that they can to fight for the average family&#39;s disappearing dollar &#45; understand that one in seven Americans is now receiving government food assistance &#45; and this consists principally of rolling out new products that cost less to produce, the lowest common denominator approach.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve noticed this within the past year as two of the three surveyed grocers &#45; each part of a separate grocery chain &#45; established new pricing policies that moved towards low prices on store&#45;brand products.&amp;nbsp; The third grocer is an independent whose store&#45;brand within the past year has been completely replaced by another supplier with an across&#45;the&#45;board reduction in the price of each item surveyed.&amp;nbsp; But what has happened within the past several months is that one of the grocery chains is now in the process of supplementing its store&#45;brand product line with another line of products that are offered by a grocery industry GPO (Group Purchasing Organization).&amp;nbsp; The savings on the products are significant; in the case of a can of vegetables, by a full 40% (from $.79/can to $.47/can) and this is being played out among other products within the basket.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also led to a mental debate on whether and how to account for this shifting in the PracticalDad Index.
When the concept for the Index arose in 2010, the pricing was based whenever possible upon the lowest prices for the items and these were, in all instances, the store&#45;brand (generic) lines of products.&amp;nbsp; Name&#45;brand items were only used when the lower&#45;cost store&#45;brands weren&#39;t available in all of the stores.&amp;nbsp; These lower priced alternatives to the store&#45;brands simply didn&#39;t exist in the products and it&#39;s only within the past few months that this has fed into multiple products.&amp;nbsp; Should I account for them or not?&amp;nbsp; Given that the baseline premise for the survey was a marketbasket of grocery items being purchased by a family with children living within an alloted monthly food budget, I opted to account for the product shift as these items would be purchased by the budget&#45;conscious family in lieu of the now more&#45;expensive store&#45;brand items.&amp;nbsp; These products aren&#39;t going away and the question that I have, based upon what I&#39;ve seen in one of the chain&#39;s stores, is whether it will actually be the store&#45;brand items going away instead.
I mentioned the term GPO in a previous paragraph and it&#39;s useful to explain what that is.&amp;nbsp; A Group Purchasing Organization is actually an old concept now brought to the grocery industry.&amp;nbsp; The first GPO was started in 1910 by the New York Bureau of Hospitals and centralized purchasing of medical items for a number of hospitals in order to maximize buying power and gain price concessions from manufacturers.&amp;nbsp; This has long since caught on amongst other industries and holds true for the grocery industry as well.&amp;nbsp; What the Index now reflects is that one of the surveyed grocers now offers the low&#45;end brand created and marketed by a GPO named Topco Associates, LLC.&amp;nbsp; This GPO is a privately held concern consisting of more than 50 separate grocery retail chains across the country with aggregate revenues in the billions of dollars and the organization uses this buying heft akin to that used by Walmart to gain concessions from food producers.&amp;nbsp; As I researched the concept of GPO for this article, I came across an online ad touting Do you want to be like Walmart?&amp;nbsp; The Walmartization of the American economy continues and I wonder where it will end.&amp;nbsp; As I write this, to my left is an orange can of low&#45;cost coffee now offered by the other grocery chain as a supplemental choice to it&#39;s own store&#45;brand coffee and I surmise that it&#39;s from yet another GPO (as yet to be determined).&amp;nbsp; And as you&#39;d expect, it&#39;s not good.
And now for the past six months of results.

<title>Driving Up the Cost of Higher Ed:&nbsp; Globalization and the Knowledge-Based Economy</title>
<body>A short while back, my middle child and eldest son &#45; aka &quot;Middle&quot; &#45; asked me how college costs managed to rise so disproportionately over the past several decades.&amp;nbsp; The resulting article was a response to his question and looked at five different factors, each of which contributed to the present mess in the cost of a college degree.&amp;nbsp; The first of these factors was Globalization and this article is the first of a series examining the factors in greater detail.
Globalization wouldn&#39;t be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about why the cost of higher education has risen so dramatically in the past three decades.&amp;nbsp; It frankly wouldn&#39;t be the second or third thing either, since the effect upon the cost of a college degree isn&#39;t primary.&amp;nbsp; The impact is derivative instead, yet it&#39;s still important because it helped to pave the road for the persistent annual tuition increases as the institutions of higher education realized that there was now a massive and sustained rise in demand for their product:&amp;nbsp; a college degree.
Globalization is the economic principle that economic progress and advancement is improved for everyone when there is a free&#45;flow of capital, technology, resources and labor across the globe and unhampered by national borders.&amp;nbsp; It is supposed to be a sort of rising tide lifts all boats effect as the aforementioned inputs flow to that global region best able to utilize them to produce in the most efficient and effective manner.&amp;nbsp; It is the linchpin concept behind the fiercely debated North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994 and the World Trade Organization, which was instituted by treaty in 1995.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s actually a reasonable concept and one that I didn&#39;t oppose when the debates occurred two decades ago.&amp;nbsp; But where the issue had an impact on higher education was a subsidiary concept:&amp;nbsp; the Knowledge&#45;Based Economy.
The Knowledge&#45;Based Economy is of more amorphous origin, but the principle is predicated upon the notion that global resources are allocated where they can be most efficiently used until they can be brought to market as a final good or product.&amp;nbsp; Since one of the basic variable costs in production is labor, it makes intellectual sense to shift lower&#45;end manufacturing &#45; requiring little education and training &#45; to third world locations where a peasant can be paid a small fraction of what&#39;s earned by an American laborer.&amp;nbsp; This would continue and the First World nations would be left to utilize their own resources in the conceptual, design and engineering aspects of the production.&amp;nbsp; Higher&#45;end and technical manufacturing would stay in the First World, at least until such time as the tides had lifted the other nations enough that they also had the intellectual and technical capabilities to support the design and engineering components.&amp;nbsp; Corollary to the Knowledge&#45;Based Economy was the Service Economy, where American workers would be spending their time providing higher end services to run and support the now&#45;displaced production aspects elsewhere across the globe.&amp;nbsp; I expect that some corporate visionaries envisioned a society in which the great mass of Americans became mandarin&#45;like technocrats in a great machine that churned out profits enriching the lives of all privileged enough to participate.&amp;nbsp; But I also now expect that there was another group of corporate visionaries who saw this as the opportunity to offshore all manner of labor costs so that unions could be undercut and profits grown.&amp;nbsp; Understand one small yet highly significant fact from the early and mid&#45;1980s:&amp;nbsp; there was a shift in how corporate senior executives were paid and stock packages and options now became even more potentially lucrative than salaries authorized by a Board of Directors.
So now start to think of higher education in terms of supply and demand and this is probably where these principles began to have an impact upon the cost of a college degree.&amp;nbsp; Preceding generations of young Americans had other alternatives to higher education so that there was less demand for it.&amp;nbsp; Young males could be drawn off into the military via the demands of the draft and the Cold War.&amp;nbsp; They also had options in sustainable, living&#45;wage manufacturing and trades that did not require a degree.&amp;nbsp; Fewer women pursued a college degree since there were fewer, then&#45;socially acceptable career paths available to them.&amp;nbsp; All of these factors meant that there was lesser demand for college, even though the GI Bill of 1944 had opened the spigot to higher education.&amp;nbsp; But then changes began.&amp;nbsp; The draft ended and the military shifted to an all&#45;volunteer basis, followed two decades later by the end of the Cold War.&amp;nbsp; Women began to achieve greater opportunities for careers and there was a decided societal push for women to obtain an education and then a career.&amp;nbsp; And through the last three or more decades, the trickling shift of American jobs began and then became a torrent.
It was now here, at the end of the 20th century, that Globalization and the Knowledge&#45;Based Economy became fully enunciated as guiding principles and the offshoring of American manufacturing began wholesale.&amp;nbsp; The resultant demand for a college degree turned the college marketing and admission process into a literal cattle chute and the colleges and universities realized that they had become &#45; for many Americans hopeful for a future &#45; the only game in town.&amp;nbsp; Even before this point, parents and guidance counselors pushed their kids to go to college so that they could have a better, more fulfilling future.&amp;nbsp; Mike Rowe, of Dirty Jobs fame, wrote about this in Popular Mechanics in August, 2013.&amp;nbsp; He described a conversation with his high school guidance counselor in which the counselor touted the value of a college degree, even to a kid who wasn&#39;t certain of what he wanted except for the understanding that his own skill set might be more technical and practical than intellectual.&amp;nbsp; I can attest to this type of conversation as well in my own experience.&amp;nbsp; So there was already a presumptuous mindset about the value of college: &amp;nbsp; but the increased demand that came from social change and the simple removal of other viable options simply drove everybody to the chutes.
But here&#39;s the thing about cattle chutes.&amp;nbsp; Some of them lead to slaughter pens.</body>

<title>The Cost of Higher Ed:&nbsp; &#8220;How in the Hell Did This Happen?&#8221;</title>
<body>PracticalDad note:&amp;nbsp; The pace of writing over the past number of months slowed significantly, even to a crawl, but the conversations with the kids have continued regardless.&amp;nbsp; Late this past summer, prior to his own departure to freshman year of college, I was talking with Middle about college costs and he looked at me and asked &quot;how in the hell did this happen?&quot;&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a great question deserving of an answer, but like so many others, not one that has an easy answer.&amp;nbsp; What follows is a series of articles looking at the interconnected factors that have contributed to the disproportionately high cost of college.

Higher Education is a hot, steaming mess.&amp;nbsp; If you look at the number of colleges and programs offered, you might not think so, but in terms of actually obtaining that college degree, it really is a hot, steaming mess.&amp;nbsp; When you actually review the data, you find that the cost of tuition has risen more than 1100% since 1978 and what&#39;s even more food for thought is that the linked article was published four years ago, in 2012.&amp;nbsp; Comparatively, the median American family income has risen only 269% in nominal dollars &#45; a not&#45;quite three fold increase over that same 1978 &#45; 2012 timespan.&amp;nbsp; Factor in the disproportionate rise in the cost of healthcare by 601% over the same period and acknowledge the fact that more of the burden of these same costs are now borne by the American family than in 1978 and you begin to understand why it&#39;s become such a hot&#45;button issue.&amp;nbsp;
But costs don&#39;t rise in such a fashion because they just levitate like so many feathers carried in the wind.&amp;nbsp; There are reasons for this and the reasons are multi&#45;fold and interconnected, one playing out upon another over the course of decades, unnoticed by the mass of people because they&#39;re engrossed in the very short&#45;term necessities of either raising a family and living a life, or just binging on Netflix.&amp;nbsp; From this perspective, there are five factors that have contributed to our present situation:

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;First, the effects of globalization and the shift to a &quot;knowledge&#45;based&quot; economy.&amp;nbsp; It used to be that entry into the fabled American middle class was predicated upon a sustainable, living wage job that could be had with just a high&#45;school degree.&amp;nbsp; That it was in a factory was acceptable since the employee could raise a family in a standard that was undreamed of during the Great Depression years, and it didn&#39;t require additional education unless the employee wanted it.&amp;nbsp; But starting in the 1980s, companies and Wall Street began touting globalization, a principle whereby American corporations maximized their their profit for shareholders by shifting the lower&#45;rung manufacturing overseas and retaining the higher&#45;end positions here.&amp;nbsp; In this model, Americans would design and engineer the goods that the world needed while the little brown and yellow people elsewhere would have to contend with the workplace drudgery and pollution that came with manufacturing.&amp;nbsp; That you didn&#39;t need to provide a sustainable living wage and could get a &#39;tween&#45;ager to manufacture a high&#45;end pair of sneakers for pennies?&amp;nbsp; For the win, baby!
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Second, there was a purposeful effort by companies in the late 20th century to alter their job requirements so that the baseline for hiring in a wide variety of positions was now a college degree instead of a high school diploma.&amp;nbsp; That these same positions were now already successfully filled by capable high school graduates was irrelevant, a degree replaced the diploma as the baseline.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s certainly an argument for some of that being the result of a desire to move beyond what was perceived to be a failing public education system incapable of turning out satisfactory candidates.&amp;nbsp; But I can speak from experience that there were other factors as well.&amp;nbsp; The predominant reason was that as businesses made this move to a degree the hiring baseline, it created a ripple effect as their competitors felt compelled to do so in order to maintain the semblance of competitiveness, particularly in the eyes of their customers.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Third, the effects of shifts in the funding paradigm for higher education.&amp;nbsp;  Where a significant support previously was provided by the government, the burden of educating young people has shifted first to the family and within the last decade, to the student.&amp;nbsp;  I don&#39;t believe that people truly understand the impact of the state and federal governments in the middle of the Twentieth Century upon higher education.&amp;nbsp; On the one side of the house, the Servicemen&#39;s Readjustment Act of 1944 &#45; aka The GI Bill &#45; made significant educational funding available to millions of servicemen who returned home from the Second World War and literally provided higher education for an entire generation of young adults.&amp;nbsp; On the other side of the house, state governments boosted spending for their state institutions through the next several decades until the amount spent per student climaxed and then began to decline in the 1980s.&amp;nbsp; The ebbing has occurred in that while there are still educational benefits for veterans, we now have a volunteer military and the numbers of available recipients is far less than in the decade immediately following the end of World War Two.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, purposeful budgetary funding per student by most, if not all, state legislatures has declined in the three decades since the Reagan Administration.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fourth, the shift to self funding by first the family and then the student was greased by years of low interest rates and the easy availability of credit.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s occurred with the funding of higher education is a microcosm of what&#39;s occurred within public society as well.&amp;nbsp; As the Congress and Executive began two decades of vicious sniping and attack, it has devolved into a farcical situation in which there is no longer an agreed upon budget but instead a lengthy trail of continuing spending authorizations and debt limit increases.&amp;nbsp; Because decisions can&#39;t be made and the debt continues to rise, the Federal Reserve has &#45; and I hate to say it, but it&#39;s true &#45; stepped into the breach to delay a day of reckoning by maintaining artificially low interest rates.&amp;nbsp; So the financial role of government in higher education has shifted from fiscal policy laid out in conscious budgetary decisions to monetary policy as shown by the low cost of borrowing money.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s the difference between fiscal and monetary policy:&amp;nbsp; fiscal policy is made by consensus, which is often messy and combative as issues are threshed through.&amp;nbsp; Monetary policy however, simply acts to delay any decisions because there is no perceived cost to borrowing and hence, no need to actually make a decision; can&#39;t make a decision because it&#39;s too unpleasant to hash through?&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t worry, we can hold off because it won&#39;t cost much.&amp;nbsp; On the micro&#45;level of the student and family, the story line for years was that borrowing to finance your education was wise because it was investing in yourself and would pay off in the long&#45;run.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fifth, all of the preceding factors braided together neatly to create an entitlement sense amongst higher education that it simply now had a captive market.&amp;nbsp; And based upon the ways in which some of the institutions have spent their money, their perception has seemed to be that the market was in the French Quarter as college presidents and administrators strolled down the Rue amidst a shower of cash screaming out laissez les bon temps rouler!&amp;nbsp; There was no perceived need to keep the spending down &#45; apart from paying for pesky things like permanent faculty &#45; since the money flowed and the steady flow of students continued.&amp;nbsp; Money was spent on increasing administration, extraneous and honestly unnecessary programs of study and physical plant and student options that are high&#45;end accessories as many of the institutions competed with one another.&amp;nbsp; And yes, when your brochures are showing photos of climbing walls and Mongolian Grills as student dining options, then that would arguably qualify as high&#45;end.&amp;nbsp;
So that&#39;s the short version.&amp;nbsp; Like much else in America, we&#39;ve gotten use to having plenty of options and choices without remembering that these options come with a price tag.&amp;nbsp; As my father used to comment from time to time:&amp;nbsp; champagne taste, beer budget.&amp;nbsp; Over the next several weeks, I&#39;ll expand upon these factors individually because honestly, there&#39;s some fascinating stuff out there.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - January 2016:&nbsp; Welcome to the Jungle</title>
<body>The pricing for the 47 item PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket is complete and after looking at the results, the one phrase that crossed my mind is welcome to the jungle.&amp;nbsp; The changes that I&#39;m seeing from one month to the next are symptomatic of what&#39;s occurring in the larger economy in multiple ways.
In terms of pure numbers, the 47 item January 2016 PracticalDad Price Index declined from December&#39;s 104.92 to January&#39;s 104.54 (November 2010 = 100) while the 37 Food&#45;Only Subindex dropped more than a full basis point from December&#39;s 106.39 to January&#39;s 105.25 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; Please note that for the Food&#45;Only Subindex, the cumulative decline from the December 2014 apex of 115.13 is now greater than 65%; it took more than four years of quantitative easing and loose monetary policy to bring that subindex for the 37 item foodstuff item marketbasket up by more than 15%.&amp;nbsp; With the cease of QE and persistent economic pressure upon the family, it&#39;s only taken 13 months to undo it.
So how is this akin to a jungle?&amp;nbsp; You have to understand why the three store average dropped as much as it did in one month &#45; unbelievably (to me, at least), the cost of a pound of 80% lean ground beef actually dropped by an average of 5.4%.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re going to store or watching the news, you&#39;d be in company with me at this drop.&amp;nbsp; But what was surprising &#45; and informative &#45; was the cause for the decline.&amp;nbsp;All of the surveyed stores sold their 80% lean beef in store wrapped packages but last week, two of the three &#45; each a part of a chain &#45; were selling their 80% in a large, pill&#45;shaped package called a chub instead of the usual packaging.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d seen the chubs before, but they had always been for the lower margin/higher fat 73% lean and because they were not part of the survey, I&#39;d simply ignored them.&amp;nbsp; When the numbers were tabulated and the indices found, I decided to go back to the two stores to examine the beef further.&amp;nbsp; Each of the chubs, now sold in the two chains, were produced by a firm called JBS LLC, USA; this is the American subsidiary of a Brazilian multinational meat packing firm founded in Brazil in 1953.&amp;nbsp; As I perused further, I saw that JBS had done a serious job of growth via acquisition of firms both in the US and elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; They have diversified first across types of protein so that they now produce poultry as well as beef and they&#39;ve diversified vertically by the purchase of massive feedlot operations used to fatten cattle prior to slaughter; in 2008, they purchased Five Rivers Cattle Feeding to make them the largest cattle feeder in the world.&amp;nbsp; They further extended their control by the 2010 purchase of the McElhaney Feedlot in Arizona, which increased their cattle feeding capacity by more than 130,000 head at one time.&amp;nbsp; So the producer of the chub is a massive presence in the beef production industry.
What scares the central banks about deflation is that during the Great Depression, money became so scarce that many companies lost control of their ability to set and maintain prices, resulting in their ultimate bankruptcies.&amp;nbsp; Competition amongst producers simply came down to which could survive long enough, a truly dog eat dog scenario.&amp;nbsp; This is eerily reminiscent as money continues to flow out of the middle class and budgeted food dollars are replaced only partially by government food stamp programs, placing greater pressure on the grocers and by extension, the producers.&amp;nbsp; As the preceding information about JBS SA shows, this is a firm that&#39;s built for survival via sheer economies of scale.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s also notable about this change in the offering of 80% lean is that the chub is now the package offering for a higher grade of ground beef.&amp;nbsp; If you accept the proposition that the lower and fattier grades of beef are the province of those with less money, then a shift in packaging to the chub by a mass producer is an indication that the extent of the family budget woes are creeping throughout the middle class.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, executives at the grocery chains are noticing drops in sales and are aware of why and rolling out a lower priced alternative is the logical response.&amp;nbsp; However, this is not the kind of indicator that you want to see.&amp;nbsp;
The jungle metaphor also refers back to one of the great impact novels of the early 20th century, Upton Sinclair&#39;s The Jungle.&amp;nbsp; Sinclair&#39;s book was a work that exposed the conditions of the meat&#45;packing industry of that period and by extension, the conditions that prevailed overall when businesses were able to operate without any form of oversight to enforce the most basic sanitary conditions.&amp;nbsp; It helped to establish the mindset that there was a legitimate role for government in the regulation of heretofore laissez faire competition.&amp;nbsp; One of the later upshots of this was the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration to oversee the safety of what goes on the table.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to necessarily say that the packing conditions are horrible and the product tainted, but when businesses get to the size that meat production is akin to factory conditions, then it does make me wonder.
And now to the results of the Indices for the past six months.

<title>Kids and Guns:&nbsp; Some Thoughts on Firearms in the House</title>
<body>The sales flyer came to the house just a few days before Thanksgiving, a mailer from a well&#45;stocked firearms dealer listing the daily special for each day between November 23 and November 30.&amp;nbsp; The predominant weapon of choice for each day&#39;s special was a pistol and given the spate about mass shootings that culminated in the ISIS attacks in Paris, most of the daily specials were a smaller size that could easily be utilized by someone with a carry/conceal permit.&amp;nbsp; Lo and behold, the data from the FBI showed that background checks were done at a rate of 2 per second, the highest rate in its history and higher than in the days after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.&amp;nbsp; But even before ISIS hit our radar screens, our society was being hit with an increased rate of random shooter incidents as disgruntled individuals took to theatres, campuses and streets to shoot out their frustration upon the innocent and the public sense of safety diminished accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Gun control rhetoric has ratcheted upwards &#45; when the NY Daily News photoshops the NRA&#39;s Wayne LaPierre&#39;s face onto the body of an arab terrorist, then rhetoric is officially on a car&#45;lift &#45; and the response of many is to wonder about society&#39;s ability to maintain some sense of order.&amp;nbsp; If public order is slipping, goes the thought, then perhaps I need to act to protect myself and my family.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a legitimate concern and the reality is that many thinking it have children &#45; and no previous experience with gun ownership.&amp;nbsp;
So if you&#39;re in this position, what are some of the things that you should consider?&amp;nbsp; Let me start off by giving a full disclosure:&amp;nbsp; I have been in this position and am now a gun&#45;owner.&amp;nbsp; This article won&#39;t go into details about specific steps to take, but it will take a look at some of the broader issues for parents considering firearms in the house.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a daunting prospect given that the there&#39;s real potential for accidental death and injury to children and teens; in 2013, more than 1600 American children died from accidental shootings and more than 9700 were injured.&amp;nbsp; Let me also state this:&amp;nbsp; this is also neither an endorsement for or against the decision to bring a firearm into the household.&amp;nbsp; That is your decision and you are responsible for any consequences that might occur.
Even before you get down to the brass tacks of responsible gun ownership, there are some basic issues to consider.&amp;nbsp; The first is to think about your own experience with firearms.&amp;nbsp; In my case, my father was a Korean War veteran who returned home from the war and sold every piece of his hunting, fishing and camping equipment so I not only had no experience with firearms, the household environment was one of absolute avoidance.&amp;nbsp; I recall him telling me as a teenager that he wanted no weapon in the household because if he ever was in the position of having to pull it on somebody, it would be with the intent of killing that person.&amp;nbsp; My wife, on the other hand, was raised with a father who worked in the judicial system and was consequently around guns her entire life.&amp;nbsp; It frankly took years for me to adjust to the concept of having a firearm in the house and it didn&#39;t happen until the kids were older and I was far more comfortable with the notion.
The second issue is to honestly consider your own experience with maintaining self&#45;discipline and whether you keep up with the requirements of anything that you take on.&amp;nbsp; Are you willing and able to follow&#45;through on a regimen of assuring that the household weapons are not only properly stored, but are even clear of bullets in both the chamber and magazine?&amp;nbsp; More important than that, if you plan to keep a loaded firearm in the house, how will you secure it so that the kids don&#39;t get hurt?&amp;nbsp; Almost three quarters of surveyed children under 10 know where their parents keep the weapons and more than a third of those kids admitted to the surveyor that they&#39;d handled them without their parents&#39; knowledge.&amp;nbsp; When in elementary school, I lived for a period up the street from a family whose father was an avid hunter.&amp;nbsp; I vividly recall that I&#39;d visit his sons and the boys &#45; my own age &#45; would pull the rifles and shotgun from the closet and play with them in my presence and without the parents&#39; knowledge.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t think that the kids won&#39;t know about the guns or won&#39;t find them, because they will.&amp;nbsp; Even &quot;good&quot; kids are curious and will rummage around closets and even dresser drawers when you aren&#39;t around.
Following on the heels of that is the question of how well your own kids listen to what you say and whether or not they heed it.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an unpleasant question and goes back to the heart of your own ability to maintain discipline amongst the kids in the household.&amp;nbsp; Two of the keys to successful discipline are whether or not you have a history of both consistency in your discipline and having a reputation amongst your kids of enforcing your discipline, or whether they understand that you won&#39;t follow through on what you say you&#39;ll do.&amp;nbsp; If you believe that the kids will mind you, then you have to decide on the guidelines for having them in the house and &#45; if you tell them about their existence &#45; what the repercussions are for the kids if they break those rules.&amp;nbsp; Kids actually do better if they understand the consequences of their actions since it gives them a clear indicator of something&#39;s seriousness.
What precisely is driving the decision to keeping a weapon in the house?&amp;nbsp; Bad news sells and the media will willingly play up the negative because it jacks up the angst and brings in the dollars.&amp;nbsp; What is happening with the crime rate in your area?&amp;nbsp; Do you live in the city or are you in a more remote rural area with a longer police response time?&amp;nbsp; If you do opt to keep a weapon in the house, then be sure to familiarize yourself with the state and local regulations on guns and home self&#45;defense.&amp;nbsp; Contact your local law enforcement officials or your state representative, or just Google the damned thing, to see what seminars and classes are being offered locally so that you have an informed base on your legal responsibilities as a gunowner.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s highly instructive to hear the local District Attorney discuss the process on what characterizes legitimate acts of self&#45;defense versus something that is legitimately prosecutable as a crime.
Ultimately, if you are going to teach the kids about responsible gun ownership, what are you going to do to teach them?&amp;nbsp; I would suggest that if you aren&#39;t someone who&#39;s familiar with firearms and are learning now, you find someone who can teach them adequately.&amp;nbsp; They can learn both a respect for the firearm and household rules from you, but actual hands&#45;on training would probably be better with an experienced individual.&amp;nbsp; Our own case was that all of us &#45; myself, wife and kids &#45; took individual sessions in gun safety and marksmanship with a man who was a former Marine non&#45;com and combat veteran and taught practical weapons usage; my comments to all of the kids prior to their sessions was that he&#39;s earned the respect and I will make your life unpleasant if you refer to him as anything other than Sir or Mister.&amp;nbsp; But even after that training, what will you do?&amp;nbsp; Target shooting has become a requested father/child activity with one of my kids and both of the others have gone on to earn the BSA Rifle Shooting merit badge.&amp;nbsp; As with anything else, practice and repetition breed comfort and familiarity.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s up to the parent to assure that familiarity doesn&#39;t give way to contempt.&amp;nbsp;
If you walk through all of the questions and still think that you&#39;re both ready and willing to bring a firearm into the household, then you need to consider both the mental/emotional and physical capabilities and constraints of the kids themselves.&amp;nbsp; Does your child have the maturity or even the mental capability of allowing a firearm in the house?&amp;nbsp; Is your child capable of learning how to use what you decide to bring in or is it beyond their physical constraints for his or her age?&amp;nbsp; If you purchase a weapon that the child is physically unready to handle &#45; whether by grip size or recoil &#45; you had better be damned sure that you&#39;ve secured it.&amp;nbsp; If you want your child to try a firearm, make absolutely certain that you&#39;ve considered these capabilities.&amp;nbsp; The incident in which a gun&#45;range instructor was killed by a nine year&#45;old girl firing an Uzi was a stunningly colossal failure in judgment by the girl&#39;s parents as well as the gun range owner and the instructor himself.&amp;nbsp; As with anything else, take the time to explore the opinions and experiences of others with firearms.&amp;nbsp; In talking with other fathers about purchasing a rifle, knowing that their own children used them and my own probably would, I found a difference in opinion on the most basic aspect of the rifle:&amp;nbsp; single&#45;shot or magazine load.&amp;nbsp; Several fathers believed that starting with the basic single&#45;shot bolt action was important as it forced the inexperienced user to slow down and think about the shot while others had no issue with going directly to the several shot capacity magazine load.
There is no clear across&#45;the&#45;board answer on whether to bring a firearm into the household.&amp;nbsp; After walking through the issues &#45; those of attitude, safety and practicality &#45;  some parents will opt to not take the risks that come with gun ownership while others will decide that they simply cannot accept those risks.&amp;nbsp; Either answer is correct if you&#39;ve done your full due diligence.&amp;nbsp; But the common element in either decision is a full review of the factors involved.&amp;nbsp; That is the ultimate breakdown in responsibility &#45; failing to walk through the different aspects to the final decision.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - December 2015</title>
<body>The data for the December 2015 PracticalDad Price Index was collected and calculated in the past three days and as I worked my way through the refrigerated aisles of the stores, I could only wonder about the price of eggnog.&amp;nbsp; This is the time that the dairies start rolling out the eggnog and knowing how the price of eggs has risen because of Avian&#45;Influenza effects upon the national supply, I wondered about the lag&#45;effect as this works through the food&#45;supply chain.&amp;nbsp; It certainly happened with the price of sweetened cereal (store brand frosted flakes) after the price of sugar rose because of hot money flows into physical commodities several years ago during one of the QE periods.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s not something covered routinely because it&#39;s simply not routine and frankly, it&#39;s pricey enough that the typical family isn&#39;t going to spend money on it.&amp;nbsp; So musings aside, what happened to the 47 item marketbasket this month?
Frankly, there was only a minimal increase in the Total Index for the 47 item basket, rising from November&#39;s 104.79 to December&#39;s 104.92 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The 37 foodstuff item subindex likewise rose from November&#39;s 105.97 to December&#39;s 106.39 (again, November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind that the Food&#45;Only Subindex now at 106.39 peaked a year ago in December 2014 at a high of 115.13, so it&#39;s still down 58% from it&#39;s all&#45;time high only a year ago.&amp;nbsp; There have been no new product substitutions made by the grocers, in which one grocer completely replaced it&#39;s store&#45;brand line at a markdown on products across the board.&amp;nbsp; Remember that the grocers have very thin profit margins and will be most sensitive to the spending patterns of their customers; as money flees the economy, they&#39;ll be the first to notice the changes in spending patterns via the profit per item on the available shelf space.&amp;nbsp;
The question now is this:&amp;nbsp; as the Federal Reserve prepares to increase the discount rate for the first time in years &#45; via a withdrawal of money from the system by way of reverse repos &#45; what will happen to these food prices?&amp;nbsp; Probably nothing in the immediate future, but after several months...look out below.</body>

<title>Whither Thanksgiving?</title>
<body>There have actually been occasions when I&#39;ve written because I&#39;ve been wrestling with a particular issue and the process of writing has helped to clarify points and issues for me.&amp;nbsp; This is going to be one of those articles and yes, it does pertain to how a larger American practice is impacting the PracticalDad household.&amp;nbsp; Most specifically, do I go out for &quot;Black Friday&quot; Christmas shopping on Thanksgiving Day itself?
In the past two decades, Black Friday has taken on an entirely new focus in American culture.&amp;nbsp; I used to think that the term was a pejorative amongst shoppers and retail staff to describe the conditions that prevailed as people crammed into stores and waited in lines for special loss leader products; I later learned that it actually referred to the accounting ledgers of many retailers, who hung on at a loss through the year as they awaited the post&#45;Thanksgiving holiday buying season and the chance to move into the profitable black.&amp;nbsp; As a kid, I knew that the folks would take us out on the weekend immediately after Thanksgiving for a Christmas buying spree but over the ensuing decades, that time span between the holiday and the shopping start has shortened.&amp;nbsp; My own experience with Black Friday began more than a decade ago when a close friend &#45; my may&#45;as&#45;well&#45;be sister invited me to join her for a pre&#45;dawn excursion to shop for presents at a now&#45;defunct mall toy&#45;retailer.&amp;nbsp; This entailed getting to the mall at 330 AM to find a good spot in line for the 530 AM store opening; the other mall stores would open around 6 or 7 AM.&amp;nbsp; This began more than a decade&#45;long tradition of grabbing the pre&#45;Thanksgiving newspaper for the shopping ads, which she and my wife would study to find those items that might best work for the Christmas lists for the half&#45;dozen kids that comprised our two households.&amp;nbsp; It became an exercise in the travelling salesman problem as we would split up lists and hit multiple locations and the cellphone made it a logistical effort worthy of transporting an army battalion.&amp;nbsp; As our kids aged and wanted to get into the act, this would be multiplied and we&#39;d have four or more individuals in multiple locations, all searching out their particular item for another person in one of the two families and it became a rite of passage for the youngsters to join in the fray.&amp;nbsp; The culmination of the experience would be lunch with any combination of the two families before heading home for a return to regular activities.&amp;nbsp; When Youngest was finally old enough to come along for this established tradition, the rest were old enough that they&#39;d moved beyond the toy phase and time had worked it&#39;s natural change upon the process.
Time also worked its own change upon the larger process as the stores opened earlier and earlier and that 530 AM opening became an almost quaint anachronism.&amp;nbsp; More stores opened at 530 AM and earlier and then the push to be first moved the opening times even earlier into the early morning hours.&amp;nbsp; This has become a vicious cycle as stores &#45; desperate for sales in an economy with a faltering middle class &#45; continuously pushed the time envelope back further and further until only the other year when suddenly, stores were opening on Thanksgiving evening itself.&amp;nbsp; As I sit here and think about it, three of the stores at the forefront of the early Black Friday morning sale &#45; KB Toys, Circuit City and Linens &#39;n Things &#45;  now defunct; it would seem that the desperation by these dying retailers fed a frenzy that&#39;s taken on a life of it&#39;s own.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s now a pushback as stores now purposefully advertise their willingness to let the employees have time with their families and people take note of the seeming callousness of the ones opening Thanksgiving Day.
So here&#39;s the crux of the situation.&amp;nbsp; I agree that the stores should stay closed on Thanksgiving and hadn&#39;t planned to go out until early Friday morning.&amp;nbsp; Yet both Eldest and Middle will be working on Thanksgiving Day &#45; one at a mall retailer and another at a local restaurant &#45; and my own family&#39;s Thanksgiving meal is purposefully being moved up to an earlier time to accommodate the evening work shifts.&amp;nbsp; Youngest has also asked for a specific item that&#39;s being sold as a loss leader at a retailer with a 6 PM opening on Thanksgiving evening.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s agreed that the item is costly enough that he&#39;s willing to contribute to defray the total cost and now the question is whether I go to the retailer in an attempt to purchase the item.&amp;nbsp; Given that it&#39;s a loss leader that would be far more expensive elsewhere, it&#39;s certain that I&#39;d also be leaving far earlier in order to stand in line.&amp;nbsp; So do I just acknowledge the practicality and give in to an already shot family Turkey Day or do I say no?
So that&#39;s where I&#39;m at.&amp;nbsp; But whatever is decided, I hope that you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll see what happens.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - November 2015:&nbsp; Deflation Reigns&#8230;</title>
<body>When I began the PracticalDad Price Index in November 2010, there was significant controversy over the outcome of the untried experiments of the Fed&#39;s Quantitative Easing:&amp;nbsp; would there be a rocketing ascent into a massive hyperinflation or would the economy collapse into a deflationary black hole?&amp;nbsp; Given the speed with which opposing events occurred both in the Weimar Republic&#39;s Hyperinflationary spiral in the early 1920s and the Great Depression in the early 1930s, it was generally supposed that whatever occurred would be quick and massive.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;re now more than five years from the onset of the Index and the third and last QE program has finished and it&#39;s only now that prices are moving far more quickly in one direction than the other.&amp;nbsp; In this case, downwards.
The index began with a baseline of 100 as of November 2010.&amp;nbsp; The 47 item marketbasket, priced at three separate and unrelated grocery stores, consisted of 37 foodstuff items and 10 non&#45;food items commonly purchased at the grocery (soap, kitchen trash bags, aluminum foil, ibuprofen and the like).&amp;nbsp; From this data each month was derived the Total Index (November 2010 = 100) and the Food&#45;Only Subindex for the 37 foodstuff items (again, November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; While the QE programs existed, both the Total Index and the Subindex rose upwards, although not at a constant or large rate.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Subindex actually peaked in December 2014 at a reading of 115.13; the cost of the consistently priced average basket had maxed at 15.13% higher than at the inception over four years previously.&amp;nbsp; But since then, the Subindex has dragged the Total Index downwards at a stunning rate.&amp;nbsp; As of the November 2015 data collection in the three stores, the Subindex has again dropped from October&#39;s level of 107.07 to 104.79; this is a full 68% decline from the high reached eleven months previously.
Here&#39;s some perspective:&amp;nbsp; it took more than four years for a consistently priced market basket to reach a high 15% above it&#39;s starting point.&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s only taken less than a quarter of that time to give back more than two&#45;thirds of that increase.
So what&#39;s behind the collapse in the market basket&#39;s food prices?&amp;nbsp; This is absolutely deflationary, but why?
Understand more than anything else that inflation is not a monolith.&amp;nbsp; It might be a wild beast when utterly untamed, such as in the 1920s German Weimar Republic, 1990s Zimbabwe or even today&#39;s Venezuela...but it&#39;s a Hydra and each head is one of the various sources of price increases.&amp;nbsp; One source of price increases comes from hot money flowing into a particular area of the economy, such as San Francisco in the years prior to 2006.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s only a limited supply of something &#45; San Francisco properties &#45; and everybody with money has to have some, so prices go up.&amp;nbsp; Until they don&#39;t any longer.&amp;nbsp; Another source is when there are only a limited number of significant suppliers of a particular item and one or more decide to raise prices to pad the profit margin.&amp;nbsp; This was the case with Kimberly&#45;Clark raising the price of adult diapers because they wanted to pad the profit margin.&amp;nbsp; This is also now the reason that housing rental rates are higher and growing moreso as the predominant American landlord is no longer some Mom&#45;and&#45;Pop but instead Blackstone Investment Group of downtown Manhattan.&amp;nbsp; Have you ever seen the neatly printed yard and corner signs offering a toll&#45;free phone number and a standing offer to buy your house for cash?&amp;nbsp; Have you ever wondered who that is with all of the cash?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s Blackstone, at least in my neck of the woods.
Bastards.
But the biggest head on Hydra is the money supply, most notably measured in Economics by both velocity &#45; the number of times that a dollar is turned over in the economy during a specified timeframe &#45; and family income.&amp;nbsp; We all know that family incomes have declined but the monetary velocity for the supply of money (M2 as measured by the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank) has decreased to lows unseen in the lifetimes of most Americans.&amp;nbsp; When a family gets a dollar, they will now sit on it, far moreso than in the previous six decades.&amp;nbsp;
So apart from housing, what is the other principal category upon which a family spends it&#39;s money?&amp;nbsp; Food.&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s here amongst the thin&#45;profit&#45;margin grocers that deflation truly seems to be appearing.&amp;nbsp; The grocers &#45; corporate and independent alike &#45; understand that their customers are stretched and are doing all manner of change to maintain sales and profits.&amp;nbsp; The Fed is terrified of a return to Great Depression&#45;style deflation because the businesses lost all control of pricing as money disappeared from the economy and went out of business.&amp;nbsp; Today&#39;s competition amongst the grocers is no longer based upon upscale stores and coffee kiosks but instead pricing, and bare&#45;knuckle at that.&amp;nbsp; When a supplier is deemed to no be longer able to provide a cost&#45;beneficial product, that supplier will be replaced by another that will; this is perhaps the key reason that the prices in the three local grocers are declining.
One of the parameters of the survey since its inception is that unless unavailable, all products within the PracticalDad market basket are store brand items.&amp;nbsp; If one of the three did not have a store brand item, then I shifted to a name brand across all three but that&#39;s only occurred in a handful of the surveyed items.&amp;nbsp; The idea behind the parameter was that budget minded shoppers will generally forego a name brand in favor of the store brand based upon price considerations.&amp;nbsp; It is also far more sensitive and responsive to prevailing economic factors than the name brands&#39; manufacturers, who usually have the financial strength to absorb periodic downturns.&amp;nbsp; One of the grocers surveyed completely swapped it&#39;s store brand supplier for another several months ago and across the line of products within that store&#39;s basket, the prices declined.&amp;nbsp; What occurred this month was that another grocer found an even cheaper supplier and introduced some items from that supplier alongside their store brand products.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been a tie&#45;breaking rule that I adopted at the outset of the Index project in late 2010 and have used only rarely since:&amp;nbsp; in the event of any question, what would a true budget&#45;driven consumer do?&amp;nbsp; I invoked the rule this month and used the lower priced item, even if not a store brand; the file has been amended and this grocer&#39;s items will be used in lieu of the store brand products.&amp;nbsp; These items at one grocer were the movers behind the Index decline and should the same situation occur again, the rule will be invoked again.&amp;nbsp; So that is why we stand where we stand at the moment.&amp;nbsp; Families must stretch earned dollars and food benefit dollars further to stay afloat and it&#39;s here at the most local level, the grocery store, that the stretch is occurring.&amp;nbsp; Because the grocers have competition to meet for the dollars and none of them will throw a family to the curb when the rent isn&#39;t met.</body>

<title>Veterans Day</title>
<body>Scrolling through the feed on the Facebook timeline brings a litany of thank you for your service messages to all manner of Facebook friends and their family members.&amp;nbsp; It is a well&#45;deserved custom that&#39;s spawned from the disgust at how the Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home.&amp;nbsp; Yet we need to be careful that it doesn&#39;t become a thoughtless, de rigeur statement that&#39;s thrown off as easily as a meaningless compliment because many of us never served &#45; a large percentage of the population hasn&#39;t served &#45; and we generally don&#39;t have a solid grasp of history and the fights in which they&#39;ve been involved.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s changed cinematically as many have now seen the early carnage of the seasonal replays of Spielberg&#39;s Saving Private Ryan or Ridley Scott&#39;s Black Hawk Down, but there&#39;s still a quantum leap between the family sofa and hunkering down behind a pile of rubble.&amp;nbsp; We say the right thing, but the great majority simply don&#39;t get it.
While I think about my own father often, I always reflect more on Veteran&#39;s Day and reading all of the thank yous made me even more thoughtful.&amp;nbsp; Dad&#39;s been dead for almost 14 years.&amp;nbsp; We knew growing up only that he&#39;d been in the service during the Korean War but it was something that he never &#45; never &#45; discussed.&amp;nbsp; I once asked him when I joined Boy Scouts if he&#39;d come along camping with me and he demurred with a gruff I spent a year sleeping outside and I promised myself that I&#39;d goddamned well never do it again so no, I won&#39;t. But he&#39;d say no more than that.&amp;nbsp; Since this was an old established troop with a strong tradition of outdoorsmanship, I caved in to my intimidation and quit.&amp;nbsp; When I later asked him &#45; during middle school &#45; about his experiences, he simple refused to discuss it and the matter was dropped.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t until many years later, when he learned that my then&#45;medical student wife was doing a rotation at the local VA, that he opened up one evening and began to talk and between that evening and the years afterwards, the stories flowed and so much that I couldn&#39;t puzzle out in my youth became clear.&amp;nbsp;
Dad had been in Korea at the outset, a mere tech sergeant doing work near the 38th parallel when the North Koreans invaded; he and his squadmates were cut off and spent days &#45; with the loss of several of his men &#45; escaping before being found by American troops and receiving what he termed a battlefield transfer.&amp;nbsp; This receiving unit was the 27th Infantry Regiment, the Wolfhounds, and he spent almost the next year with them before finally rotating back stateside to finish his enlistment as a drill instructor.&amp;nbsp; He related incidents of leaving a makeshift bar in a shack in Pusan to literally cross the road to repel a massed North Korean attack in the blackest days of that conflict, of seeing his buddy so drained by the violence that he killed one of his own pilots in a barfight after warning him to stop  badmouthing the infantry who were being pushed relentlessly backwards.&amp;nbsp; A few years before he died, I learned that whenever he was in the Midwest on business, he&#39;d take an extra day and stop at Fort Leavenworth to visit this man.&amp;nbsp; Dad spoke of massed Chinese attacks after they entered the war and how the differential in sizes between the American bayonet and the outsized Chinese bayonet, aka the pigsticker, gave birth to decades of nightmares.&amp;nbsp; There were other stories but it was even later after his retirement in 1991, that more became evident.&amp;nbsp; Dad finally came to terms with his experience and contacted his congressman to help in obtaining the citations for which he knew that he&#39;d been nominated but had opted to never touch before then; it required additional effort since the Veteran&#39;s archive in which his records were kept was badly damaged in a fire decades before with the loss of an untold number of servicemen&#39;s records.&amp;nbsp; When the congressman&#39;s office finally finished helping him, we found that these included the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for courage under fire.
I have no photos of my father in uniform, although I do recall seeing one photo of a young man wearing glasses and a helmet, kneeling in the dirt outside of Fort Bliss, Texas.&amp;nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if he handled them the way that he handled all of his camping and hunting equipment when he later returned home to the Laurel Highlands of Western Pennsylvania...he simply got rid of all of it and promised himself to never do them again.&amp;nbsp; His decorations and division and regimental insignia are safely put away although I do, on occasion, pull them out to look at them and think about the old man.&amp;nbsp; He certainly mellowed with age but the experience changed him forever.&amp;nbsp; I recall seeing him watch an Army recruitment commercial &#45; Be all that you can be...&#45; and just rolling his eyes while he shook his head.&amp;nbsp; When I discussed with him the idea of enrolling in ROTC during college, he argued against it and persuaded me to put the notion to rest and that there was no reason to feel guilt for not doing so.&amp;nbsp;
So would I tell my father thank you for your service, as insufficient as it might seem?&amp;nbsp; Now it would seem to be the least that I could do, although it absolutely isn&#39;t enough and his response would be a typical if you feel that strongly about it, then get your head out of your ass and actually do something.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s what we should do for these men and women who are serving.&amp;nbsp; Pay closer attention to the controversy occurring in the Veteran&#39;s Administration and if you aren&#39;t vocal, become moreso.&amp;nbsp; Learn about the service dogs that are increasingly taking an important role to provide an emotional anchor for returning vets and throw support to those who raise and train them; in a short attention span society, we forget that the effects of combat stress can last for decades and the canines won&#39;t be a one&#45;off effort.&amp;nbsp; Most important is this, however:&amp;nbsp; understand that we are now entering a time in which the promises made to all of the various constituencies in American society can no longer be supported by the resources available to us.&amp;nbsp; We can no longer run endless deficits without burning out the engine and at that time, we&#39;re going to have to renegotiate the social contracts that have bound us together and it will be a truly ugly process.&amp;nbsp; It will be then that you&#39;ll have to remember what many of the vets suffered through and advocate forcefully on their behalf and in that way, you can begin to repay the debt owed them and show that their service truly isn&#39;t forgotten.</body>

<title>Managing the Decline</title>
<body>We live in an increasingly gender&#45;neutral society as customary roles continue to change, in some ways slowly and in some ways, not.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re now more than two decades into the stay&#45;at&#45;home&#45;dad scenario and it&#39;s gone from a notable phenomenon to a far more widespread and mundane situation.&amp;nbsp; If you aren&#39;t certain about that, pay attention to that faithful barometer of social change, the television commercial.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve  moved from the standard means&#45;well&#45;but&#45;clueless&#45;in&#45;the&#45;household&#45;Dad across a broad range of products to considerably more commercials where Dad is actively engaged in managing the household and interacting with the kids.&amp;nbsp; The former still exists but it&#39;s not as prevalent as it once was.&amp;nbsp; But as this continues to progress, men had better get used to the fact that there&#39;s liable to be a point in their middle&#45;aged lives when they&#39;ll not only be responsible for managing the rise of their children but also the decline of their parents.
There are most certainly cultural influences.&amp;nbsp; China&#39;s society is one in which the son is responsible for the ultimate care of the parents and that &#45; coupled with their long&#45;standing one child policy &#45; has led to a profound imbalance in the male/female ratio as newborn girls were given up for adoption so that the parents could have another shot at having a son.&amp;nbsp; But American culture has historically been predicated upon the daughter having principal responsibility for the care of her aging parents.&amp;nbsp; The model with which we&#39;ve been familiar through our lives has been, until relatively recently, one in which the man worked and the woman was responsible for the household responsibilities and that extended to caring for their aging parents.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been stretched considerably with the rise in mobility and the nuclear family, and even further by the movement of the woman into the workplace.&amp;nbsp; This has been offset by the growth of local and state government programs to provide increased assistance for the elderly and the great majority, if not all, of American counties have some semblance of an Office of Aging to act as a portal to the panoply of programs designed for the aging American.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;re now at a new point in American history in which the promises made to all of the various layers and segments of our society are far outstripped by the resources available to meet them; the former Comptroller General under Presidents Bush and Clinton, David Walker, recently noted that the actual federal debt is triple what is reported due to the unfunded liabilities taken on by the government.&amp;nbsp; These unfunded liabilities would include especially the promises made to the elder generation &#45; Social Security &#45; and Medicare.&amp;nbsp; It is simply unsustainable.
While there are going to be increasing concerns and issues about the funding, the costs of providing care to an aging population continue to mount.&amp;nbsp; These costs are not at an outrageously disproportionate rate like college tuition, but they are increasing slowly and steadily and having an impact upon the family.&amp;nbsp; According to a report published by Genworth Financial, the median hourly rate for a homemaker service worker &#45; who assists with non&#45;medical and &quot;hands&#45;off&quot; activities for the elderly and can help to maintain their independence &#45; is $20 and the five year compounded rate of 1.61%.&amp;nbsp; Note that this is for the most basic assistance available to an elderly person and has the lowest rate of cost growth.&amp;nbsp; When you reach the higher levels of care, such as a semi&#45;private nursing home room, the cost has risen over the past five years by a compounded rate of 3.57%.&amp;nbsp; And that cost is not being borne solely by the elder and the governmental programs.&amp;nbsp; A survey of more than 1400 households involved in caregiving for an elder found that fully 46% of those households were spending more than $5000 annually in their funds to assist their elders.&amp;nbsp; So once again, costs are increasing and the sandwiched generation is being pulled from yet another direction.&amp;nbsp; Paul Krugman can wax eloquently about existential American despair in the op&#45;ed pages of the Times, but this type of issue goes to the heart of the matter.&amp;nbsp; The American middle class is beset not only by decreasing incomes on one side, but increasing costs and responsiblities on the other as more costs are offloaded back to them.&amp;nbsp; This middle class generation was raised in a particular environment &#45; employers with a set of benefits, a belief in the value of education, and an activist government &#45; and they&#39;re watching it vanish as costs are shifted back to them and most importantly, their children.&amp;nbsp; Healthcare benefits?&amp;nbsp; Higher tuition?&amp;nbsp; Jobs that enable their children to take their own place as productive adults?&amp;nbsp; Nope to all of that.&amp;nbsp; And when you consider that the writing is on the wall for future government spending, then there&#39;s really nothing existential about it.
So what does this mean going forward?&amp;nbsp; An understanding that the old model of following the job and then monitoring the elders from a distance and managing via a cobbled&#45;together network won&#39;t be as operative as it once was.&amp;nbsp; State and local programs will be constrained and there&#39;s a greater likelihood that the facilities available to help care for invalided parents will be less than optimal and perhaps, households will shift to more of an integrated and intergenerational model with the elders close by to assist with the children and in turn be assisted by their children and growing grandchildren as they become increasingly infirm.&amp;nbsp; My own perspective is also framed by an understanding that even if we don&#39;t realize it, our children are watching us and taking their lessons from our actions and inactions alike.&amp;nbsp; That means that I try to model a more hands&#45;on and involved approach with my own parent, even if the roles are increasingly reversed and frustrating in their own way.&amp;nbsp; If we can&#39;t &#45; and honestly shouldn&#39;t &#45; look to government and the private sector to handle everything, then we have to be prepared to step in and manage ourselves as best as we are able.&amp;nbsp; And if the parents are ultimately living longer, then the simple truth is that the men are going to have to move beyond their comfort zone and take on the additional burdens because their own mates are going to be similarly pressed; but if men can take on the kids &#45; and we are most certainly able &#45; then we can likewise take on the elders.</body>

<title>...and a child shall lead them</title>
<body>Part of me believes that I should sit down with my son and watch the first half hour of the Democratic debate tonight.&amp;nbsp; And then the other part of me remembers that the media (hint, CNN) is actively trying to get Biden to run and I realize that it&#39;s a complete circus freak show.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, a week in advance and CNN is holding a debate podium for a guy who hadn&#39;t declared?
I think that I&#39;ll just wait for the Bad Lip Reading version and take bets on whether they give Hilary a man&#39;s voice.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &#45;comment on personal Facebook page on day of first Democratic debate
I posted the above comment on my Facebook page late this afternoon as an expression of the intense frustration with our present political gridlock.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s ingrained that my principal job as a parent is to prepare my kids to take their place as productive and moral adults in the great wide world and part and parcel of that preparation is exposure to Civics and the political process.&amp;nbsp; Yet the frustration lies in the understanding that the political process is presently captive to the monied interests, much as it was during the days of the late 19th century Gilded Age.&amp;nbsp; Top it off with the knowledge that the corporate media isn&#39;t just reporting the news but actively trying to massage it on both sides of the political spectrum &#45; thank you, CNN and Fox &#45; and I was sincere in my desire to blow off the entire thing in order to share a good action flick with Youngest, now in middle school.
With Mom out of town on business and his elder siblings off at college, he and I are doing the bachelor thing.&amp;nbsp; We opted to watch a recently released action film but as we paused periodically for one thing or another &#45; typically involving snacks and fridge raids &#45; I commented on the debate, which was scheduled to air in another half hour.&amp;nbsp; Understand that Youngest is living proof that the kids are capable of playing up, provided that you make it a habit of taking the time and effort to discuss the world and events with them.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s listened to conversation with his older siblings through the years and there have been instances when he&#39;s returned to me for clarification on whatever he&#39;s been privy to hear.&amp;nbsp; Youngest has known for years who Bernie Sanders is because I made it a point to have him and one of his siblings listen to a short clip of Sanders&#39; 2010 filibuster, made immortal by the common refrain ...and they can&#39;t afford diapers; it wasn&#39;t a lengthy clip, but it did accompany an explanation of what a filibuster was and how rare it was anymore to actually hear one.&amp;nbsp; After a short break, I thought that even if I was frustrated, I should at least give him the choice of what he wanted to watch and my frank expectation was that he&#39;d opt for the film.&amp;nbsp; It was a real surprise when he looked over at me from the sofa, took the lead and said no offense, Dad, but I&#39;d kind of like to see a bit of it.&amp;nbsp; We can finish the film tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; It was an internally jarring moment as I realized that I was ditching my responsibility, one that I&#39;d pursued regularly with his siblings, and that I was doing him a disservice.
At 8:29, we flipped off the movie and turned on the debate for the opening introduction through the question on gun control, at which time we turned off the television to start the bedtime routines.&amp;nbsp; During that interval, he and I would take turns making comments &#45; surprisingly serious and not the usual snark &#45; and there were multiple instances in which I commented that I&#39;d be coming back to a particular point.&amp;nbsp; There are now multiple issues and comments written on a notepad in the kitchen for referral over the next several days and I&#39;ll make it a point to periodically visit those points in short conversations.&amp;nbsp; And yes, the two predominant issues will be wealth/income inequality as well as gun control, those items covered in the first part that we watched.&amp;nbsp; As time passes and more is discussed, we&#39;ll go into some of that as well.
So what&#39;s the takeaway as I sit here on the sofa, writing?&amp;nbsp; The first, and probably most important, is that parenthood is a marathon instead of a sprint.&amp;nbsp; As your family grows and then begins to move out into the world, it&#39;s easy to slack off a bit either because you think that you&#39;ve got it all down pat or more importantly, just because you&#39;re tired.&amp;nbsp; Trust me, teenagers can take it out of you and when you&#39;re onto teen #3, the wear on the tire can be a bit much.&amp;nbsp; Tonight was a gentle smack in the figurative face that I was willing to forego what I absolutely wouldn&#39;t have ten years ago and that it was a disservice to a child who deserves as much as his older siblings.&amp;nbsp; The second was the misconception that Youngest would be willing to skip the whole thing and stick to the movie instead of checking out the debate.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a knock on his generation that they&#39;re tuned out and while I do subscribe to that in the main, tonight makes me wonder whether it&#39;s because they truly don&#39;t care or whether we simply don&#39;t give them the opportunity of playing up to adult issues.&amp;nbsp; It certainly was almost the latter in Youngest&#39;s case tonight.&amp;nbsp; My role as a father and parent is changing in terms of the two older kids, now off to college, but it hasn&#39;t changed with Youngest and it&#39;s something about which I&#39;m going to have to remind myself.&amp;nbsp; I will, however, have to also remind myself to not just rule out the current event conversations just because I don&#39;t think that they&#39;ll be interested.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - October 2015:&nbsp; Statistical Noise on the Fifth Anniversary</title>
<body>The data has been collected and calculated for the PracticalDad Price Index in October 2015 and the result of this 60th monthly edition is a resounding example of minimal change and statistical noise.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index for the 47 item marketbasket is 106.17 (November 2010 = 100) while the Food&#45;Only Subindex of 37 foodstuff items declined from September&#39;s 107.17 to 107.07 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The most notable change in the monthly occurred in the lunchmeat and deli cheese items (one pound prices for cooked deli ham and store brand American cheese, respectively).&amp;nbsp; The price for each item rose by $1/pound at one of the three separate grocers to $4.99/pound apiece and was aided and abetted again by one of the other grocers not having the cheese on the shelves; this meant that the price increase for the one store had a larger impact on the average price of deli cheese due to the absence of the third.&amp;nbsp; This type of occurrence in which one or another of the stores has an intermittent hiccup in the supply of one item has been noticeable, especially within the past year.&amp;nbsp; In different months, I&#39;ll go in to price and find that one store of another simply doesn&#39;t have one of the sampled store&#45;brand items on the shelf and in fact, doesn&#39;t even have a shelf tag to indicate that it&#39;s even in stock.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s in one of the chain grocers, I&#39;ll swing by different locations to ascertain if it&#39;s purely a location issue and if not, I&#39;ll simply leave that item blank for that store with the result that the average price for the item is predicated upon two grocers instead of the standard three grocers.
So this is the fifth anniversary of a kitchen table project to ascertain what&#39;s really going on with food prices.&amp;nbsp; I began the project in the late summer of 2010 because the Federal Reserve had engaged in a series of unprecedented policy manuevers &#45; Quantitative Easing &#45; that had the blogosphere humming with debate of whether this would radically impact prices or whether it wouldn&#39;t be able to offset the feared deflation arising from a near economic collapse in 2008.&amp;nbsp; Many didn&#39;t trust the CPI issued by the government&#39;s Bureau of Labor Statistics and I figured that I could spew essentially meaningless bytes across the screen calling bullshit or I could put previous experience to use and provide a hopefully meaningful data point.&amp;nbsp; You see, in the dark and distant past, I had an internship at the research department of a local chamber of commerce and was tasked in that summer to set up the local city for inclusion in the national chamber&#39;s cost&#45;of&#45;living index, measured periodically and compiled for cities across the country.&amp;nbsp; It was grunt work contacting dozens of businesses to gain their input on an ongoing basis but it was at least educational as I also got to see how the mechanism worked.&amp;nbsp; When the chamber hired me for further economic research after college (what is the impact of an avian influenza epidemic upon the county&#39;s poultry industry, you ask?), one of my corollary tasks was to continue with the collection of pricing and it was during this period that I was able to meet and work with the researchers who devised the survey for the national chamber.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s actually easy once you get it set up, provided that you go to the effort of being thoughtful in the creation of the instrument and follow up with consistency amongst the items priced and it was in the several month creation phase that various things were tried and eliminated.
So what have I learned in the past five years?&amp;nbsp;
The first thing that I&#39;ve learned is that inflation is not an event with a single cause, but instead a process affected by a variety of often competing factors.&amp;nbsp; The bloggers and pundits in 2008 were looking at the various QE programs with the idea that the vast amounts of money about to be pumped by the Federal Reserve and other central banks into the system would have a fully systemic effect &#45; a rising tide lifts all boats impact.&amp;nbsp; There was an opinion, which I shared, that we would go the way of the German Weimar Republic and end up with a hyperinflation that destroyed the currency.&amp;nbsp; But prices were actually affected by a wide variety of factors.&amp;nbsp;  The Food&#45;Only Subindex &#45; consisting of 37 separate foodstuff items in bread/meat/dairy/produce/staples groups &#45; rose from the baseline of 100 in November 2010 to a peak of 115.13 in December 2014.&amp;nbsp; While this increase was neither linear nor constant, it did rise as items were affected by different factors.
These factors included such things as simple supply and demand, as exogenous events such as drought or disease affected the price of one or more of the particular items in the basket.&amp;nbsp; One of the earliest factors captured in the index in the first year was the impact of hot money flows into commodities.&amp;nbsp; As money from the first QE program began to flow into the financial sector, the wizards of Wall Street promptly began to divert some of that into commodities with the thought that these raw materials had greater value than money itself because it was actually physical so hey, it&#39;s gotta be good because there&#39;s something actually there.&amp;nbsp; Among the commodities were aluminum, sugar and coffee.&amp;nbsp; The run&#45;up in oil prices around 2012 and 2013 led to a corresponding significant rise in the grocery store as various forms of cooking oil &#45; which had sources that also served as biofuel sources &#45; rose significantly, albeit lagging the rise in oil prices.&amp;nbsp; The oil rise was a function of both hot money commodity flows and foreign political factors.
I&#39;ve also learned that while prices can go down again, as it did for items such as canola oil and coffee (although not as low as it was beforehand), stealth inflation packaging is a great way for producers and grocers to gain a little bit more profit margin on their goods.&amp;nbsp; From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s a great way to ensure a little extra profit margin as nominal prices go down on the newly repackaged item but not enough on a per ounce basis to make it truly cheaper.&amp;nbsp; It also resets the scale as it were, so that there&#39;s a new baseline price upon which they can act in the future and over time, people will lose sight of how much the original price actually was.
But these factors are truly only temporary factors that can be remedied &#45; and largely have been &#45; with a change in situation.&amp;nbsp; As the QE programs ended, the hot money flows have diminished significantly and the supply issues will ameliorate over time as either supplies again increase or demand is shifted away and to other items so that there&#39;s a new equilibrium reached.&amp;nbsp; In each of the commodities already listed &#45; sugar, aluminum foil, coffee and cooking oil &#45; the prices have either stabilized or again dropped, although not to the original level because prices never drop as readily as they increase (thank you, grocers and producers).
So the Food&#45;Only Subindex rose over four years from a baseline of 100 in November 2010 to a high point of 115.13 in December, 2014 and it was this period that demonstrated the effect of the various factors as they overtook the effects of the deflation so feared by the Federal Reserve and other assorted central banks.&amp;nbsp; But it was in the ten month period from January to October 2015 that deflation took the reins from the other factors as the Food&#45;Only Subindex literally collapsed from December&#39;s 115.13 to this month&#39;s level of 106.17 &#45; a drop of 53% in a period of time only a fifth of that through which the index rose.&amp;nbsp; Despite the best efforts of the Federal Reserve to move prices upwards, it was in this ten month period that the deflation that it so feared came through as the effects of lower incomes and increased food stamp usage finally surged through the mass economy.&amp;nbsp; Grocers aren&#39;t stupid.&amp;nbsp; They live with a thin profit margin and as a result are sensitive to their customers&#39; needs, wants and especially circumstances.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been in these past ten months that another process, more violent, as surged through as the grocers have found new suppliers willing and able to provide lower&#45;priced alternatives to their clientele.&amp;nbsp; The Great Depression taught that in a deflationary environment, few businesses survive and the three grocers have each gone to lengths to fight one another &#45; and Walmart &#45; for market share, rolling out new pricing strategies as well as simply finding new suppliers to provide the lowest cost alternatives for the customers.&amp;nbsp; Yes, other prices are increasing such as rent, health care and tuition.&amp;nbsp; But when looked at on a market basket basis, it&#39;s the grocery where prices have crashed.
People often learn best when presented with an illustrative point or analogy and it&#39;s here that I&#39;ve struggled for some while to find the right one to drive the point home.&amp;nbsp; Until this past weekend when I went camping with Youngest&#39;s scout troop and came down to the kitchen area early one morning for a coffee to kickstart the day.&amp;nbsp; As I sipped the scalding black coffee, I looked at the scoutmaster&#39;s camp stove and noted a pot with a lid to heat up hot water.&amp;nbsp; But what was different about this pot was that there was a built&#45;in spigot that extended from the bottom and allowed a person to dispense hot water without having to remove the lid or worry about ladles and it was this pot that struck me as the best example of the interplay amongst inflationary and deflationary factors.&amp;nbsp; Think of the economy and prices in the most general terms as a pot on a stove and prices as the level of the heated water within the pot.&amp;nbsp; Economic activity is moved by transactions much as water is heated by a source and as the economic activity increases, it heats the economy and prices will generally rise much as the water level in a heated pot will rise when the lid is on.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the view that&#39;s been taken by the economists and it&#39;s to this end that all actions have been taken.&amp;nbsp; Prices have risen due to some of the factors that we&#39;ve discussed before, the level bubbling due to supply shortages and hot money flows and for all of the effort, the pot really does appear to be active and hot.&amp;nbsp; But if you keep the heat on the pot yet use the spigot to remove water from the pot for a cup of instant coffee or oatmeal, the water within will continue to boil and bubble and yet the water level will drop despite the heat and this is the deflationary effect.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t matter what occurs with the other factors.&amp;nbsp; Prices for individual items can rise like a bubble, but on a cumulative basis, the price level will drop as the incomes &#45; the water &#45; drain away.&amp;nbsp; Customers can and will alter their buying habits, replacing steak with inferior goods or simply doing without and the grocers and producers will have to do whatever they can in order to continue to make sales.&amp;nbsp; And when they can do no more, they&#39;ll simply go out of business like their predecessors in the Great Depression.
So what will be the outcome of this thus&#45;far eight year trip down the monetary rabbit hole?&amp;nbsp; Will there be hyperinflation that destroys the currency or will deflation win out?&amp;nbsp; The sad reality is that nobody really knows now since the central banks took actions that literally destroyed the metrics that were used to understand what was happening around us.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t a national pricing project as several respected financial/economics bloggers have correctly pointed out and I&#39;m not about to pretend that it is; but I do believe that it can and does serve as a reliable datapoint for those who are interested.&amp;nbsp; And if you&#39;re interested in doing this to satisfy your own curiosity, just be sure to be consistent in the marketbasket over time.&amp;nbsp; But even if you don&#39;t go this far, make it a point to pay greater attention to what you&#39;re seeing in the stores and on the streets, because it&#39;s our own inattention that has helped this monetary nonsense flourish.</body>

<title>The Kids Are Paying Attention</title>
<body>You&#39;re wrong if you think that the kids aren&#39;t paying attention, because they are.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something I&#39;ve realized for a long time and last week was another example as Youngest related what he&#39;d heard standing in line at a used gaming store.&amp;nbsp; His older siblings have periodically surprised me with what they&#39;ve heard and realized through the years and yesterday was Youngest&#39;s turn.&amp;nbsp; He was standing in line to purchase a game while I browsed some feet away, and there was a young father and mother with a toddler in a stroller ahead of him.&amp;nbsp; The parents were purchasing a Destiny PS4 system expansion pack and immediately after he turned from the counter with his box in a bag, the father immediately returned to the cashier and asked if he could get a second bag &#45; preferably gray or dark colored &#45; into which he could put the bagged expansion pack.&amp;nbsp; The father commented that they were returning home downtown &#45; approximately five miles away &#45; and didn&#39;t want to run the risk of being mugged in their neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; Youngest watched as the clerk obliged and double&#45;bagged the purchase, then watched further as the young family exited out the door and through the parking lot to the highway, upon which he then moved up for his own purchase.
It was as we were walking to our own vehicle that Youngest mentioned the overheard conversation with the opening statement man, I feel terrible... followed by his description of what he&#39;d witnessed.&amp;nbsp; From that point onwards for the next ten minutes or so, the conversation ranged over a variety of topics that emanated from his observations.&amp;nbsp; First, the notion that the family might have actually walked about five miles, carrying a bag and pushing a toddler in a stroller and that if you didn&#39;t have some form of reliable transportation in American society, your options were limited at best.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s already witnessed friends of his elder siblings who were occasionally jammed because of this vehicle situation and this instance just served to reinforce that it not only affected individuals but could also affect families with children as well.&amp;nbsp; Second was the comment about spending priorities; if you couldn&#39;t afford a reliable vehicle, should you really be spending what little disposable income you have on a game expansion pack and especially if it&#39;s obviously for yourself instead of for your toddler?&amp;nbsp; The third was the simple comment I&#39;d hate to find myself in that situation with my agreement that both Mom and I were working hard to assure both that he wasn&#39;t in that predicament at present and that he had the skills and judgment to assure that he wouldn&#39;t find himself there in the future.
This morning&#39;s conversation in the car to school was another situation that he witnessed and after offering my input, I noted to him that part and parcel of my job as a father was to help him take all of these experiences and knit them together into a recognizable form that provided context for his life.&amp;nbsp; It is our job as parents to do precisely that and especially if we&#39;re making a purposeful effort to not shield them from the world as some parents do; we must listen to what they say and use that as a departure point for as many permutations as time and attention will allow.&amp;nbsp; It is this constant effort at conversation and context that will help them establish a sense of not just right and wrong, but also a context of what is appropriate versus simply acceptable versus the worst case, aberrant.&amp;nbsp; This is not a one&#45;off event but instead a constant, persistent process that will take years and if we handle it properly, will come back to us as we ourselves age and the adult children can help provide context for us in a changing society.</body>

<title>Craigslist Chic</title>
<body>Society changes as the younger generation rises to take its place and begins to supplant the dying&#45;off elders.&amp;nbsp; It always happens and now is no different from when the Boomers supplanted the Silent Generation.&amp;nbsp; But we now have a problem since our economy is predicated upon consumption and yet incomes are declining and the demands upon the family budgets are growing.&amp;nbsp;So how is that change occurring?&amp;nbsp; Watching Eldest and one of her peers, who I&#39;ve had the privilege of knowing since that young woman was in early elementary school, is both educational and reflective of what&#39;s occurring in the broader society.&amp;nbsp; It can best be described as what I refer to as Craigslist Chic.
With the news that family median income has again dropped to levels not seen since 1989 and poverty rising to new levels, it&#39;s a new world for those who grew up expecting a particular lifestyle and finding that it&#39;s simply unattainable.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been an expectation of a newer house in the suburbs with newer automobiles, late model appliances and in a nod to this new generation, an array of interconnected devices that increasingly make up what is referred to as the sensornet.&amp;nbsp; And advertising continues to push this drive to have as much as it ever has, promoting the image and the goods with unabashed enthusiasm.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s obviously a gap growing here between the desire for the things and the ability to afford said things and the rise of Craigslist is one of that ways that people are managing to bridge that gap.
The site began two decades ago and in its earlier days, had a touch of the wild west aspect to it with news blurbs coming across about the occasional individual who was trying to sell a kidney or engaging in some odd and unsavory transaction.&amp;nbsp; As full disclosure, I managed to go for years without viewing Craigslist and only began to seriously view it after Eldest began perusing it on a routine basis.&amp;nbsp; The situation was now reversed because in their much younger years, I routinely monitored electronics and the media ahead of them and when the kids were truly young, I would periodically watch bits and pieces of MTV and BET to see what was happening with the culture.&amp;nbsp;  At twenty years old, Craigslist is now a veritable institution on the web and as I watch, it&#39;s become one of the key ways that the youngsters are bridging that gap so that they can far more affordably attain what&#39;s been trotted out over the years by the consumer machine.
It has been fascinating to watch Eldest, who has the goal of her own place yet has grasped that the old ways of just walking in and furnishing a house or apartment en masse is no longer realistically operative.&amp;nbsp; She approaches the goal as a puzzle with the parameters of currently available funds, wants and available prospects via Craigslist; she is assured of safe storage because we&#39;re already holding furniture left by other family members for when the kids are on their own.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve watched her spend free time quietly perusing Craigslist with the occasional comment to her mother about how she likes this or that particular item and on a few occasions now, I&#39;ve gotten the word that she&#39;s gone to a particular place in order to look at one thing or another and sure enough, a piece of furniture winds up in my garage for safe disposition until its time is come for use.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the other young woman, my might&#45;as&#45;well&#45;be niece, she furnished her first apartment via an assortment of means.&amp;nbsp; Utilitarian furniture came from her parents&#39; house to supplement what little she&#39;d already accumulated, she purchased from highly discounted furniture stores and found to her surprise that she could purchase a like&#45;new set on Craigslist for a fraction of what she&#39;d seen the same set in a retail furniture store.&amp;nbsp; The site has become almost ubiquitous and the ability of consumers to connect with one another and transact goods outside of the traditional retail will only place even greater stress upon the traditional bricks&#45;and&#45;mortar economy, already stressed by the rise of online retailing.
The other aspect of Craigslist is its inherent teachable lessons in human nature, and this is where the youngsters might need some input from their elders.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a truism amongst any retailer, either brick/mortar or online, that the customer is always right and almost all businesses at least make an attempt to honor that.&amp;nbsp; But Craigslist allows the person to interact with any kind of person and that goes partcularly to ethics &#45; moral, immoral or simply amoral.&amp;nbsp; In my few instances of Craigslist usage, I&#39;ve run into two instances of ethical lapses; the first was a misrepresentation about circumstances as a young adult trying to make a buck as a used car dealer misrepresented himself in a potential car sale while the second jacked the price of an item when he realized that he&#39;d been dealing with my wife and I didn&#39;t have a hard copy of what they&#39;d discussed.&amp;nbsp; In the first instance, a young adult was with me and we walked on the transaction and in the second, I wound up paying an additional $30 on the deal that I didn&#39;t realize the issue until I was almost home.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that all Craigslist sellers are dubious, because they aren&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; But it does mean that if you know that your youngster is actually thinking of using it, it would be helpful to offer your assistance as they move forward and I suspect in most instances, they&#39;d be willing to accept the input.&amp;nbsp; At the minimum, talk to them about some simple safety rules:&amp;nbsp; first and foremost, if you&#39;re going to meet someone, make sure that someone close to you knows the physical details of the meeting &#45; time, location and the identity of the seller, even if just the Craigslist identifier &#45; and more preferable would be having someone come along with you.&amp;nbsp; Second, meetings when possible should be at public locations and if for any reason your internal alarm system is triggered &#45; y&#39;know, I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable with this &#45; find a reason to simply decline the potential transaction and get out of there.&amp;nbsp; Third would be to assure that you have a record of all communications &#45; digital or hard&#45;copy &#45; to avoid the prospect of any he said/she said scenarios that might spiral out of control.&amp;nbsp; Beyond that simple threesome, you can discuss whatever other aspects you wish.
Having been around for two decades &#45; an eon in digital terms &#45; Craigslist and it&#39;s peers aren&#39;t going anywhere.&amp;nbsp; It serves a purpose and that will only increase as the youngsters use it more and more to help them bridge the gap between economic reality and the images of adulthood that they&#39;ve been sold throughout their youth by the consumption machine.&amp;nbsp; But if you become aware that the kids are using it, feel free to offer your perspective because you have the experience factor that they haven&#39;t yet acquired.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - September 2015:&nbsp; Stabilizing, but&#8230;</title>
<body>The data from the September 2015 PracticalDad Price Index is in and the price declines of the past nine months have ceased and stabilized, for now at least.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve been noticing something and it&#39;s gotten me to thinking about the earliest stages of what&#39;s happening with wealth inequality and how it might be starting to affect the grocery store.
In terms of the actual Index results, both the Total Index (47 total market basket items) and the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index (the 37 foodstuff items in that basket) stabilized with the Total Index rising incrementally to 105.21 (November 2010 = 100) from August&#39;s Total Index reading of 104.96.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index likewise rose slightly to 107.12 in September (November 2010 = 100) from August&#39;s result of 106.97.&amp;nbsp;
But what have I been noticing in the past number of months and what has this to do with income inequality?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s take a quick look at income and wealth inequality first.&amp;nbsp; The disparity between the highest levels and the remainder of American society have been noted in several ways.&amp;nbsp; Obviously, the percentage of assets held by the top 3% of families has reached large proportions as the remaining 97% of American families have fewer and fewer assets available to them.&amp;nbsp; The lack of retirement savings has led to a situation in which middle&#45;aged and older Americans have a lower unemployment rate than other age groups.&amp;nbsp; As income and wealth have bifurcated &#45; split &#45; this has likewise been noted in the prices of different markets of items.&amp;nbsp; While the BLS reports that CPI and wholesale prices are largely static, there&#39;s been greater price inflation in products oriented towards wealthy buyers.&amp;nbsp; The price of truly high&#45;end luxury automobiles has risen as has the price of collectible artwork as the ultra&#45;wealthy look for new assets in which to place their money.&amp;nbsp; The point to take away from this is that there&#39;s a notable split between the economics for the average American versus the wealthier American.
So how does that impact the daily shopping in the grocery store?&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;m noticing over the months leads to this question:&amp;nbsp; is the product mix on the store shelves beginning to disproportionately affect the lower&#45;income level consumers as their best alternatives for products are either removed completely or replaced with lower&#45;quality products as grocers rework their product mix in order to survive?
The key point to remember about grocery retail is that it&#39;s a business with extremely low profit margins and that with a limited amount of shelf and freezer space, products have to have a sufficient amount of profit or they&#39;ll be removed and replaced with an item that&#39;s more profitable.&amp;nbsp; Grocers do pay attention to this metric and are constantly re&#45;evaluating their product mix in order to maximize their own bottom&#45;line.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve noticed is that the grocers are slowly &#45; and thus far on a small scale &#45; removing items from the shelves that are better for customers but worse for their bottom line.&amp;nbsp; It began over a year ago when one of the grocers &#45; an independent &#45; simply removed the two baby&#45;related items (23.4 ounce Enfamil formula and a store&#45;brand case of size 3 diapers) from their shelves entirely.&amp;nbsp; That formula is no longer sold as the selection was thinned out and the store brand cases of diapers were eliminated.&amp;nbsp; Parents with children could still purchase the size 3 store brand diapers, but in the smaller packaging with a higher per&#45;diaper cost.&amp;nbsp; About three months ago, the second of the three retailers likewise removed their case of size 3 store brand diapers from all of their stores &#45; I checked multiple locations in that chain each month &#45; so that that option was no longer available for the family with small children.&amp;nbsp; Again, the smaller packaging was available, but it&#39;s more expensive on a per&#45;diaper basis.
Another instance pertains to the sale of 80% lean ground beef.&amp;nbsp; Over the past several months, one of the grocers &#45; which has also removed the case of store&#45;brand diapers from the shelves &#45; has eliminated 80% lean ground beef from its meat case; it still sells the leaner ground beef at various percentages (85 and 93) as well as the less expensive 73% that is sold in a tube.&amp;nbsp; Please note that this same 73% ground beef tube is sold in all of the stores.&amp;nbsp; Given that the markup is progressively higher for each lean/fat category as it increases, the grocer is implicitly stating that the low cost mass produced 73% lean container will be available for the low&#45;end market but that the profit mix is best served by eliminating the 80% and pushing the higher end, more profitable ground meats.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve become used to the sales pitch that leaner meat is better and more will hopefully &#45; for the grocer &#45; purchase the less&#45;fat ground beefs; what&#39;s interesting was that in researching this article, I found that the yield of actual cooked meat was most cost&#45;effective for the 73% lean than the higher leans since a pound of 73% lean after cooking left 11 ounces of meat while the far more expensive 93% lean left only 12.75 ounces of meat after cooking.&amp;nbsp; The lost weight was due to fat that was able to be drained away.&amp;nbsp; In this particular instance, it might be a mixed blessing for the lower&#45;echelon consumer if he is willing to be serious about draining the fat from the cooking.
There&#39;s early initial evidence that the same issue is occurring with both hot dogs and tuna as well.&amp;nbsp; One grocer has eliminated the store&#45;brand hot dog in entirety while I&#39;m noticing that another grocer is starting to not carry store&#45;brand tuna; I&#39;ll be checking the various locations for that grocer in the next several months to verify whether that is or isn&#39;t the situation.
This is assuredly a small sample on a local level and I&#39;m not going to fight to show that it may or may not be occurring nationally.&amp;nbsp; But it is indeed occurring here and my concern is that if it continues, what is starting on a very small scale will accumulate to more and more products that are, on the whole, detrimental to the family trying to make the monthly budget work.
And because a full update hasn&#39;t been shown in several months, here is the listing of Total and Food&#45;Only Index results going back to December 2014.

<title>College Education and &#8220;Skin in the Game&#8221;</title>
<body>I think that the kids need to have some skin in the game...
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Tech Guy and Father to the PracticalDad

This comment was made to me several days ago, just a day after both Middle and another posted a video about Bernie Sanders proposing free college tuition for all Americans.&amp;nbsp;  Taped in a conference room at his Burlington, Vermont campaign headquarters, candidate Sanders restates the issue &#45; higher education is unaffordable to hundreds of thousands of young Americans &#45; and follows with both a plan and a plea.&amp;nbsp; Since I&#39;m unable to find this video outside of Facebook, I&#39;m providing a link to a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer in which the same proposal is discussed.&amp;nbsp; Please understand that you have to get through a short segment on Hillary Clinton as a setup for the interview.
As full disclosure, I like Bernie Sanders even though I&#39;m nowhere near a socialist in my leanings.&amp;nbsp; When he gave a filibuster in late 2010, I made it a point to have the kids watch &#45; even if only for a few minutes &#45; so that they could see a filibuster in action and his name has come up in later discussions with the kids.&amp;nbsp; The problem is painfully and correctly obvious.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve allowed a system to be created that predicates supposed achievement and financial security upon the acquisition of a degree that can cripple a young adult&#39;s prospects for more than a few years and the cumulative level of student debt now surpasses the national level of credit card debt.&amp;nbsp; The mantra in the PracticalDad household for the past eight years has been we need to get you through college with as little debt as humanly possible and Eldest is almost at that point now.&amp;nbsp; So how do we make this happen for the millions of other young Americans?
What Sanders proposes is a popular two&#45;fer, free tuition for all young Americans to be funded by a transaction tax upon each stock trade made on all equity markets across the country.&amp;nbsp; Get the youngsters excited while simultaneously sticking it to Wall Street.&amp;nbsp; The transaction tax specifically is a $.50 fee made upon each market transaction by all entities that trade in the exchanges and is what is referred to generically as a Tobin Tax, in honor of the man who first proposed the concept several years ago.&amp;nbsp; It is partially based upon the number of shares in any particular transaction, so a hedge fund moving 100,000 shares of a company would pay the tax while Joe Six&#45;pack moving 100 shares of the same company in his own transaction would not.&amp;nbsp; The fees would be aggregated and then used to fund the tuition for any college student in the country, at any public school.
But here&#39;s where the Tobin Tax concept becomes interesting.&amp;nbsp; The equity markets have reached the point at which more than 2/3 of all transactions are now done via HFT &#45; High Frequency Trading &#45; aka what is now nicknamed Skynet.&amp;nbsp; In other words, high speed algorhythmic programs running out of the TBTF banks and hedge funds across what is considered Wall Street.&amp;nbsp; The key idea behind the original concept was to somehow curb the amount of HFT trading so that that small group of investors would no longer have an outsized advantage on the rest of the public; by the time that Joe Six&#45;pack can place a single sell order, an algorhythmic HFT program can execute dozens for a distinct advantage.&amp;nbsp; HFT wouldn&#39;t be outlawed but it would be curbed.&amp;nbsp; The potential tax revenue on this would, by estimate of 2008 transactional data for all forms of financial instrument trades &#45; stocks, bonds, swaps, etc &#45; amount to greater than $300 Billion and even if the result of the transaction tax is a 50% reduction in the number of trades, the proceeds would approximate $175 Billion.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s with a five year old report based upon trade data from 2008.&amp;nbsp; As angry as Main Street has become with Wall Street&#39;s predation and apparent control of the levers of political power via campaign contributions, Sanders&#39; proposal has the potential for some serious popular legs.
But after thinking about the proposal, I have two issues with it and neither pertains to the Tobin Tax, but instead the notion of free tuition itself.&amp;nbsp; The first concern is more pragmatic &#45; what&#39;s the point of paying for every young American&#39;s tuition if there&#39;s no real, sustainable&#45;living wage job available for him or her upon completion?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a lovely notion that Junior can achieve a more affordable education but at the end of the day, the point of higher education is ultimately to prepare people to take their places as productive members of society.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s hard to be productive if there isn&#39;t enough economic activity to support said jobs and the end result is that the youngsters continually return to gather even more credits because there&#39;s nothing else to do.&amp;nbsp; Taken to it&#39;s logical conclusion, the program eventually costs even more because the kids just go to school instead of being gainfully employed.&amp;nbsp; Without sustainable, living&#45;wage jobs for them, this is akin to nothing more than refueling airplanes so that they can maintain holding patterns instead of being able to land and letting the passengers get on with their lives.&amp;nbsp; Sanders is correct in that he makes this a concrete proposal as part of a larger package of actions that have to occur.
The other issue is more philosophic.&amp;nbsp; Should we put together and sponsor a package in which something such as the tuition for higher education is free or should we, as a society, make the statement that it has sufficient value that the student and/or family should still put something towards it?&amp;nbsp; In other words, assure that the student has some skin in the game, as the other father stated to me later.&amp;nbsp; I believe that it&#39;s human nature that we have more appreciation for that in which we&#39;ve had a personal stake.&amp;nbsp; How many of us parents have seen kids take greater care of those items where there&#39;s a personal investment?&amp;nbsp; If you want to make it a sliding scale tuition based upon income, then so be it; but society can still absorb sufficient of the cost that the amount owed isn&#39;t punitive or exhausting to the payer.&amp;nbsp; Part and parcel of the philosophy piece &#45; dark as it is &#45; is the notion that there is no such thing as a free lunch (TINSTAAFL).&amp;nbsp; Even if there&#39;s no ticketed monetary cost to be paid, there exists the prospect that the price will be paid in other forms and in this case, the prospect of some form of compulsory national service via a re&#45;institution of the military draft and/or form of civilian service.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an old idea that has been kicked around first by one side and then another but as funds go to one particular group and others believe their ox to be gored, the resultant clamor could result in such a deal being reached.&amp;nbsp; Hey, the kids are getting free tuition and money&#39;s tight elsewhere...why not let them pay it back another way?&amp;nbsp; Some can disagree that it might ever happen and some can disagree that it&#39;s a bad thing, but the prospect exists and it needs to be out there before any final decision is reached.
The issue might seem insurmountable given the barrage of commentary from one side and another amidst a 24/7 newscycle.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s good to remember that our country has made such statements about the value of public higher education before and each in times more troubled than these.&amp;nbsp; The great land&#45;grant universities &#45; Berkeley, Purdue, Penn State and the like &#45; arose out of legislation passed during the Civil War and the GI Bill arose out of the ashes of the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; And these were far greater fights than what would be faced with the Wall Street crowd.</body>

<title>Managing the Transition to Adulthood</title>
<body>You might not think about it now, but that child that you tuck in each night will at some point reach adulthood, or at least some semblance of it given the present economic circumstances.&amp;nbsp; Just as we should never have gotten into Iraq without some serious consideration about the endgame, parents should begin to consider their own endgame with the kids, i.e. phasing out their own responsibilities and passing them along to the nascent adults.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a question that my wife are only now starting to consider with the Eldest of our three children, who is now entering her senior year in college and is legally able to drink.&amp;nbsp; How should the parents phase out their present responsibilities?
It&#39;s not like it used to be where the kids left home after graduation &#45; high school or college &#45; and got a job that permitted them to become financially independent adults.&amp;nbsp; The jobs environment of the decades through the 1990s is no longer operative as the one&#45;person&#45;full&#45;time&#45;with&#45;benefits job model has been replaced with the multiple&#45;part&#45;time&#45;no&#45;benefits job model; what some have begun referring to as the gig economy.&amp;nbsp; This move towards a newer, more uncertain way to make a living exacerbates what has become a debate on when adulthood actually begins.&amp;nbsp; The consumption model of the economy is predicated upon the formation of households to sell all of the wonderful stuff that makes a house a well&#45;furnished house (not a home, just a well&#45;furnished house unless you put in the effort and time) and when the young people cannot afford or are unwilling to make those decisions &#45; moving out, marriage, parenthood &#45; then the result is a slowdown in the economic driver as those milestones are, at best, delayed.&amp;nbsp; Toss in the albatross necklace of student debt and there&#39;s a true impediment to economic growth.&amp;nbsp; The result is that there a fair number of middle&#45;aged parents who are doing what they can to help their nascent adult offspring; the question that you should consider while you still have time is to what extent you wish to go?
When I survey the panoply of Opies that I&#39;ve come to know through the older two kids, Eldest and Middle, there&#39;s a massive disparity between what different parents will do for the kids.&amp;nbsp; At the one end of the spectrum are the sets of parents who actually expect the kids to help with paying the multiple household bills that come in, including mortgage and utilities.&amp;nbsp; The thought process seems to be congratulations, you&#39;re now an adult and despite only having a part&#45;time job, we expect you to chip in as a full&#45;fledged adult.&amp;nbsp; The fact that Junior might only be a high school graduate or have outstanding student debt overhanging him is irrelevant to the situation.&amp;nbsp; The kid &#45; adult? &#45; is expected to contribute even if it means that he&#39;s further handicapped and prohibited from getting out on his own because of this requirement.&amp;nbsp; While it is unscientific, my observation seems to be that these cases are predominantly amongst parents who are best described as working class or blue collar and could likely be under financial stress as well.&amp;nbsp; In one particular case, the young adult has been told for years that once he reached the age of 18, he&#39;d be responsible for his own food, clothing, transportation and would have to pay rent as well.&amp;nbsp;
The other end of the spectrum are those who not only stand responsible for educating the kids, but are also willing to provide financial cover for as long as legally practicable.&amp;nbsp; I know of multiple sets of parents who are keeping the kids on their employer&#45;provided health insurance even after they&#39;re graduated from college.&amp;nbsp; One close friend even researched the regulations and found that her chemical engineer son could stay on her insurance until the age of 25, even if he was well&#45;employed with a plan that he could purchase through his own employer.&amp;nbsp; Since this young man has graduated from college and graduate school with a considerable amount of student debt &#45; he once commented I&#39;m in so much debt that I could start a government &#45; every little bit that he can throw at the debt to work it down is worthwhile and their family understanding is that cover will be provided so long as the money goes to pay off the debt.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s ditto for the auto insurance and the caveat is that he and his siblings will stay on the auto policy until they can truly take on their own or they screw up and cause the premium to rise.&amp;nbsp; This also brings up the other aspect which is that of responsibility; if the parents think that the kid is responsible enough to appreciate the privilege that&#39;s being afforded by the parents and is actually appreciative of it.&amp;nbsp; If the kid is technically an adult but the privilege afforded actually prevents him from learning by shielding from poor consequences, then nobody would think poorly of any parent that threw in the financial towel and said to hell with it.
So think about it and start to determine where you are.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a multi&#45;dimensional question with parameters of age &#45; kid and parent &#45; as well as breadth &#45; just financial or extending to other areas &#45; and personal philosophy.&amp;nbsp; But understand that it&#39;s a question worthy of consideration as the present economic climate continues to warp and torque what was once conventional wisdom and practice about life and adulthood.</body>

<title>The Value of a Car&#8230;</title>
<body>If there&#39;s anything that&#39;s become apparent in the past month, it&#39;s the necessity for having a vehicle in order to hold a job.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s always public transportation if both your home and job are near a route, but it&#39;s highly possible that either one or the other won&#39;t be near one and in that case, a car is vital for a livelihood.&amp;nbsp; Such was the lesson when multiple vehicles in the PracticalDad household simultaneously opted for a sit&#45;down strike, creating mayhem in the otherwise smoothly flowing schedule.
This is a family that has lived with a vehicle philosophy:&amp;nbsp; buy newer used and run them until the wheels drop off and by that, I literally mean that.&amp;nbsp; Except for my wife&#39;s Toyota &#45; now at 11 years of age and more than 180000 miles &#45; we&#39;ve always driven used and four of the cars throughout our 28 year marriage have been towed away for salvage.&amp;nbsp; Some have died quietly, with a whimper or a simple passed away in its sleep overnight and one went with a violent fit, tossing a piston through the engine while running at 60 miles per hour on a four lane highway.&amp;nbsp; The point is that we drive them until they simply won&#39;t be driven ever again.&amp;nbsp; Until recently, the stats on the four vehicles were that the youngest was my wife&#39;s, at eleven years of age although that was also the highest mileage, followed by my rolling dumpster with 151000 miles.&amp;nbsp; Each of the older kids had their own beater, one a hand&#45;me&#45;down from Grandmother when she gave up her license, and each needed it since both worked two summer jobs to beef up the bank account for the school year.&amp;nbsp; We also know kids who have had to borrow one or another of our own in order to get back and forth to jobs because of their own want of a vehicle.
But the past month was a figurative wreck as first one car &#45; Eldest&#39;s &#45; went down with what appeared to be terminal issues, followed by my own.&amp;nbsp; This left us with a math problem:&amp;nbsp; two vehicles split amongst four drivers, one of whom requires a fully functioning automobile and another two that have to make it to another four separate jobs between them, each job working a different shift each day.&amp;nbsp; The ten point question is this:&amp;nbsp; how do you make this work?&amp;nbsp; Given that Youngest also had his own set of activities and I run the household, the only way to conceivably make it work was to revert back to earlier years when Dad literally ran a taxi service.&amp;nbsp; If one of the working kids had a late shift and no one required use of a vehicle, then that kid drove to work; otherwise, it was once again Dad&#39;s Taxi and it wasn&#39;t uncommon for me to toting and hauling on a midnight run to a job.&amp;nbsp; It was the first of a series of lessons for the kids &#45; the need for many of the working poor to have a vehicle in order to even have a shot at holding a job at all.
So apart from that realization, what other lessons came from the experience?&amp;nbsp; First was whether it was even an option to even repair it and Eldest already had done a visit to Kelly Blue Book to ascertain the value of her vehicle.&amp;nbsp; The second lesson was the value of a good mechanic.&amp;nbsp; Since I was out of town that week, she and my wife had it towed to a shop that&#39;s done some of our repairs in the past but with which I&#39;ve become increasingly concerned over the past year.&amp;nbsp; When they reported that her car had a cracked head gasket with repairs at a cost of $2700 &#45; outstripping the car&#39;s value of $2200 &#45; I had it towed to another garage for a second opinion, recalling last Autumn&#39;s out of state car repair event when the repair cost was significantly less than originally anticipated.&amp;nbsp; In this case, the second garage fixed Eldest&#39;s car for less than $60; which was also the third lesson, the value of a second opinion.&amp;nbsp; Throughout the process, conversations with the kids about the progress continued so that they knew what was happening as it occurred.&amp;nbsp; The point was to not only keep the costs down and the vehicles running, but also to teach them so that they would have an idea of what to do should this happen to them in the future.&amp;nbsp;
The final lesson was about how to purchase a new vehicle and surprisingly, it was Youngest who came along for those sessions since his elder siblings were working.&amp;nbsp; While my van was likewise repairable, the risk of running old vehicles made it apparent that we still needed a more reliable car and since she deserves it, it would go to my wife.&amp;nbsp; Youngest sat in on the sessions with the sales reps but all heard the questions and commentaries to my wife &#45; what do you really need and what do you really want?&amp;nbsp; Once the parameters were established, it was a question of finding what worked and most cost&#45;effectively.&amp;nbsp;
So we now have a new 2015 to complement the others.&amp;nbsp; Both mine and Eldest&#39;s were repairable and are in use, although mine is now used solely for hauling equipment, debris and yard waste.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a little more for the insurance but it&#39;s still cheaper than ruining one of the other vehicle&#39;s interiors or renting a pickup truck.&amp;nbsp; The final point is this:&amp;nbsp; these experiences and decisions are all part and parcel of adulthood and it&#39;s better to teach the lessons yourself when they&#39;re available than just expecting that the kids will figure it out when they&#39;re older.&amp;nbsp; If situations arise, identify them to the kids and talk through the process with them, engage them whenever possible and share the results with them.&amp;nbsp; For these everyday adult occurrences, no young adult should ever have to look back and say I wish someone had told me before.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - August 2015 / Total Index Collapse</title>
<body>PracticalDad note:&amp;nbsp; This is an abbreviated update for the August 2015 Price Index.&amp;nbsp; The summer has been busy and full and writing has been curtailed because of, well...life.&amp;nbsp; That said, the pricing for the August edition of the PracticalDad Price Index did occur at the first of the month and this is the abbreviated version; more will be coming on this when things gear up again in another week.
The PracticalDad Price Index resumed it&#39;s decline, which has occurred almost uninterrupted since reaching the peak in late 2014 and early 2015.&amp;nbsp; What is most notable is that the Total Index (covering the cost of 47 grocery store items priced in three unrelated grocery stores with November 2010 = 100) dropped significantly by 1.34 basis points from July&#39;s reading of 106.30 to August&#39;s level of 104.96.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Index of the 37 Foodstuff items from the basket also declined in the month, although not as precipitously; July&#39;s Food&#45;Only Index was 107.35 but declined to 106.97 in August.&amp;nbsp; Please note that the peak index reading for each category was 111.32 in January 2015 for the Total Index and 115.13 in December 2014 for the Food&#45;Only Index.&amp;nbsp; Since those peaks, the Total Index has given up 56% of the price increases that had occurred since the Index&#39;s inception in November 2010; the Food&#45;Only Index component has given up 54% of the price increases that occurred since November 2010.</body>

<title>If it&#8217;s not about me, then who is it about?</title>
<body>My principal goal as a parent and father is to raise children to become moral and productive adults, capable of taking care of themselves in the great wide world.&amp;nbsp; This seems to have once been a simpler task given that more and more young adults are coming out of college saddled with debt and either returning home or at best, treading water while they look for the opportunity that permits them to flourish as full&#45;fledged adults.&amp;nbsp; But that goes to the productive side of the equation; where my wife and I have worked assiduously is to help develop their moral side.&amp;nbsp; Apart from the usual perceived affliction of church attendance and religious education, we&#39;ve pushed service, requiring volunteer service even before it rears its head in middle and high school.&amp;nbsp; When each of the kids has reached 13 years of age, we&#39;ve required that they find an outlet for volunteer service and each has responded in kind and now Youngest has his own gig, thoroughly different from his older siblings and very much in keeping with his developing Linus&#45;like sensibility:  I love mankind, it&#39;s people that I can&#39;t stand.&amp;nbsp; As we&#39;ve talked through the years, I&#39;ve gone back to one of the multiple communication taglines that reiterates the point &#45; it&#39;s not about you, kid &#45; and each has heard it repeatedly.&amp;nbsp; Youngest has probably heard it more than either of the other two because he&#39;s sometimes been present when said to his siblings but hasn&#39;t had the experience and maturity to comprehend the full meaning.
But even when the younger kids aren&#39;t saying anything, it doesn&#39;t mean that they aren&#39;t thinking about it.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s not about me, then who is it about? was the question that came off of Youngest&#39;s lips as we sat in the car several weeks ago.&amp;nbsp; There was nothing sarcastic about the question, asked as we drove to get yet another pair of shoes for a growing young teen.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d been puzzling over it because he&#39;s heard me say it so often through the years.&amp;nbsp; Children are by nature ego&#45;centric and it&#39;s only as they grow and their perspective widens that not only the awareness of existence, but also the welfare of the others, begins to develop.&amp;nbsp; Self moves first to immediate and then extended family, then outwards to friends and hopefully beyond that to others who aren&#39;t necessarily even acquaintances.&amp;nbsp; But being a moral person means not only an awareness of others but also a willingness to work in ways that benefits others, even if they aren&#39;t friends and family, and that is a perspective that frequently has to be taught both by conversation and example.&amp;nbsp; But the effort to raise a moral person is frequently opposed by the tone and tenor of modern American culture.
That we live in a narcissistic society is a well&#45;documented given.&amp;nbsp; For the record, narcissism is defined as inordinate fascination with oneself; self&#45;love; vanity and highly covered and somewhat controversial books have documented that psychological test scores measuring narcissistic tendencies have increased over the past three decades.&amp;nbsp; A deliberate societal push for self&#45;esteem &#45; sometimes without the backing of any actual accomplishment &#45; joins with a stunning array of personal electronic devices that permit the user to record their image and voice again and again and again in the search for perceived cool perfection; with an ability to immediately delete what&#39;s not wanted and an immense memory storage and the focus inward is hard to resist.&amp;nbsp; This rise in narcissism is an inherent threat to morality since it&#39;s predicated upon self while morality is predicated &#45; at least partially &#45; upon caring for the welfare of others.&amp;nbsp; The narcissist&#39;s view is inwards and superficial while that of the moral person is outwards and &#45; hopefully &#45; deeper.&amp;nbsp;
So the effort as the kids age is to get them to shift that perspective outwards and away from themselves.&amp;nbsp; It means considerable conversation &#45; occasionally a monologue when they&#39;re sullen &#45; and a deliberate effort to engage them in the outside world, helping them find a meaningful way to work on the behalf of others.&amp;nbsp; It means a willingness to establish limits on the electronics, whether refusing to allow certain devices or setting limits on usage time and media content.&amp;nbsp; It means a willingness on your own part to model the kind of behavior that you wish them to exhibit.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t a one&#45;off instance but instead a lengthy and constant process that can be both rewarding as well as tiring, sometimes throwing another iron into the fire of a family schedule.&amp;nbsp; It is about teaching them that there is more beyond simply themselves and their own needs and wants and that real progress can come when a few are willing to step up and lead; when others see the effort, they will often in turn be drawn out from within and join the effort on behalf of others.&amp;nbsp; There are all manner of student organizations, student honor societies and school districts that promote voluntary service hours amongst youth, but the primary focus has to be from within the family itself because that&#39;s where the child is going to get the greatest example and emphasis.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - July 2015</title>
<body>The pricing for the July 2015 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index was completed last week and this is one of those months where honestly, not much happens.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index (comprising the full marketbasket of 47 grocery store items priced at three separate and unrelated grocery stores) did drop from June&#39;s 107.11 to a new level of 106.30 while the Food&#45;only Index (comprising the basket&#39;s 37 foodstuff items) rose however from June&#39;s 106.46 to July&#39;s 107.35.&amp;nbsp; So the question is, how can foodstuffs rise while the total index declines?&amp;nbsp;
In the past seven months, the grocers have taken multiple steps to lower their regular prices.&amp;nbsp; One chain implemented new regular store&#45;brand pricing under a Low Everyday Prices banner while another took similar steps under an Everyday Low Prices banner; yep, you can&#39;t make this up.&amp;nbsp; Those two had decreased the regular, non&#45;sale prices of a multitude of store&#45;brand items and as the effects of these flowed through the Price Index, the independent grocer switched the supplier of its store brand items so that the lower prices on items were noted by the Index as well.&amp;nbsp; The result was notable as an almost ripple effect on the results as one change after another in the span of December 2015 through July 2015 affected the Index downwards in a deflationary manner.&amp;nbsp; The most recent effects are from the independent grocer as it continues to roll out new store&#45;brand items; this occurs both as they become available and as the old inventory items from the previous supplier are exhausted and subsequently replaced by the new items so that any rollout can take months before it&#39;s completed.&amp;nbsp; In July&#39;s edition of the Index, the independent introduced the new supplier&#39;s version of plastic kitchen trash bags (13 gallon) at a price that was 29% lower than the old supplier&#39;s offering.&amp;nbsp; Couple this with some much smaller changes on non&#45;foodstuff items and the effect is significant.&amp;nbsp;
Amongst the 37 item foodstuff components, what was notable was the effect of hot dogs.&amp;nbsp; In this case, one of the chain&#39;s store&#45;brand hot dogs joined the other in a stealth&#45;inflation increase as the packaging decreased from a full pound per eight hot dogs to 15 ounces and since I monitor that item by weight &#45; one pound being the original standard &#45; I adjusted the price upwards to reflect what it would be had it continued with the conventional 16 ounce packaging.&amp;nbsp; But unlike all of the other months however, the independent grocer&#39;s store&#45;brand hot dogs simply disappeared from the case and it continued to be gone over the multiple visits that I made to that store to check on the hot dogs (and yes, it seems odd to walk into a grocery store, look in a case and just walk out again).&amp;nbsp; The independent&#39;s brand has been consistently less than the chain brand hot dogs and this absence meant that the average for the hot dogs is now significantly higher than before &#45; hence the higher index level, all other things being equal.&amp;nbsp; My suspicion is that they&#39;re in the process of shifting that product &#45; hot dogs &#45; to the new supplier but that it simply wasn&#39;t available yet and I&#39;ll see that in the next month&#39;s edition.&amp;nbsp; To be honest, there has been a hot dog brand that cost less than even the independent&#39;s store&#45;brand but I&#39;ve not monitored that since the supposition from the outset of the Index was that I&#39;d be following store&#45;brands whenever they were available and before I deviate, I want to assure that this isn&#39;t a case of just awaiting a new supplier&#39;s product.&amp;nbsp; If that doesn&#39;t happen, then I will move to that lower&#45;priced brand in lieu of the store&#45;brand product.&amp;nbsp; What was fascinating in a massively geeky way was that the independent&#39;s case for hot dogs was missing multiple brands and much of the space had been given to larger packages of sausages in what appeared to be an attempt to keep it from looking completely barren.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll have to see how it appears next month.&amp;nbsp; And yes, the price of eggs increased due to diminished supply because of the Avian Influenza that&#39;s wiped out about a tenth of the nation&#39;s flock, also contributing to the higher level, but it was frankly less of an increase than I expected.</body>

<title>A Summation to Date&#8230;</title>
<body>Change happens.&amp;nbsp; It sometimes comes unexpectedly and in the blink of an eye and at other times, with considerable notice and more than a little planning.&amp;nbsp; As I write this, Middle is on the cusp of leaving for his freshman year in college; when I began writing this website, he was in the fifth grade.&amp;nbsp; Eldest is working two summer jobs to squirrel away money for her final year of college and she was in middle school when the first article ran in 2008.&amp;nbsp; Last night, I realized that Youngest has continued his persistent growth spurt as I now have to slightly incline my face to look into my eighth&#45;grader&#39;s eyes.&amp;nbsp; When I began this project, he was just entering kindergarten.
Some years ago, my better half suggested that I write a book.&amp;nbsp; I personally enjoy writing although it&#39;s sometimes been frustrating because being the stay&#45;at&#45;home parent with active kids doesn&#39;t always lend itself to long periods of time for reflection and composition.&amp;nbsp; Activities, errands, meals, laundry, paperwork and all of the things that make a household run means that the traditional model of sitting down for hours to compose an essay or article isn&#39;t always operative.&amp;nbsp; Never having written a book and knowing that the fatherhood is cool but look at the funny things that happen when Dad is in the household meme was well covered, I opted to start with a website instead with the notion of moving on to a book.&amp;nbsp;
That hasn&#39;t yet happened.&amp;nbsp; But after more than 740 articles and essays to date, I&#39;ve learned a few things.&amp;nbsp; The first is that the writer that I&#39;ve become is not the writer that I was at the inception of this site.&amp;nbsp; I believe that a writer has to have a voice and what I write now is nothing like what I wrote at first because I simply didn&#39;t yet have one.&amp;nbsp; My voice is that of a father who sees massive change ahead and who wants desperately to raise his children to be productive and moral adults in an America that&#39;s going to be truly different from the one in which I was raised.&amp;nbsp; I am a late Boomer, now in my mid&#45;fifties, and believe that my generation has done a poor job of parenting, most especially in letting their children become wrapped into an electronic cocoon and devoid of the guidance and information that kids need in a complicated culture.&amp;nbsp; I do not believe that a person raised as part of the Me generation &#45; who truly embraces that notion &#45; is the best fit for a role that is as far removed from Me as being a parent.&amp;nbsp; It is personally galling to talk to a young person and hear the phrase I wish that someone had told me and my personal vow has been that my own children never be able to say that about me.
The second is that I&#39;m not the kind of writer who can just sit and write a quick article in response to one thing or another.&amp;nbsp; A publicist told me years ago &#45; yeah, I tried that &#45; that I was what was referred to as a source writer, someone who wrote in the background and frequently provided materials for others but never engendered an avid following that left a lengthy comment thread.&amp;nbsp; She was correct because I find it difficult to write quickly and can indeed spend hours &#45; and on a few occasion, days &#45; to find the right information and words for a particular article or idea.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s honestly a bit lonely since I hear so little in response yet it&#39;s immensely gratifying to know that over the years, so many have taken the time to place me on their Syndication Feed</body>

<title>Keeping in Touch as Kids Age</title>
<body>One of the questions that I&#39;ve asked myself as the kids age and begin to move out into the world &#4#45; whether camping trips or high school trips &#45; is how much I should try to keep in contact with them.&amp;nbsp; It was one thing when they were younger and going away and either my wife or I could expect the typical homesickness/touch&#45;base call.&amp;nbsp; But it came into focus when Eldest went off to college three years ago and it&#39;s one that I&#39;m asking again as Middle now prepares for college departure.
One of the knocks on my generation&#39;s parenting is that we&#39;re helicopter parents, constantly there to protect and smother the kids in our effort to make their lives safer and better.&amp;nbsp; Yet that term can itself be confusing as Eldest&#39;s college dean implied to parents at freshman orientation that parents who went to all of the kids&#39; events and games were such; after all, his parents &#45; in the 1960s &#45; only made one of his own high school games and my personal opinion is that he&#39;s suffering a case of sour grapes.&amp;nbsp; In a conversation two years ago, Youngest &#45; then still in elementary school &#45; commented that he viewed hovering parents as shelter parents who attempted to shelter their children from all possible mishaps.&amp;nbsp; Youngest&#39;s case&#45;in&#45;point then pertained to a baseball parent who yelled at a coach during a game; it&#39;s an event that has happened since that time almost three years ago.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, Youngest has made it clear that if he gets yelled at by a coach in my presence, it&#39;s my job to shut up.
But the question remains:  how should communication occur after they depart?&amp;nbsp; My own experience in going to college was that, barring unexpected questions or situations, I should call my parents collect once a week on a predetermined night.&amp;nbsp; As it was, there were plenty of unexpected situations my freshman year and the phone calls were a bit more frequent for the first semester at least.&amp;nbsp; But the newer technology base makes communication easier and more ubiquitous.&amp;nbsp; Many parents require that kids with a Facebook account &quot;friend&quot; them, at least for the account that the folks know about.&amp;nbsp; Parents can thus see the latest photos of Junior dressed up with his date before the big party on the public account while Junior&#39;s peers get to see the grisly after&#45;party photos on Junior&#39;s private account site.&amp;nbsp; No, kids, we&#39;re not stupid.&amp;nbsp; The almost&#45;universal presence of cellphones &#45; or as I refer to them around the kids, texty&#45;thingies &#45; means that we parents have the capability to step in to help the kid with a problem on a moment&#39;s notice.&amp;nbsp; That presumes that (a) the kid wants our help and asks for it, and (b) that we have the willingness to help them should they ask.&amp;nbsp; If I want my kids to be productive and moral adults, capable of standing on their own two feet, then I have to accept that both (a) and (b) have corollaries.&amp;nbsp; The corollary to (a) would be that things might not turn out optimally because the kid chose to attempt management on her own without my input and if that&#39;s the case, then my job is to monitor my own mouth and perhaps offer a quiet post&#45;mortem at a later time.&amp;nbsp; The corollary to (b) would be that there might come a time when I opt not to assist but instead stand back and let them deal with the issue themselves with whatever subsequent consequences might arise.&amp;nbsp; It could be a highly valuable object lesson but one that&#39;s painful for the immediate relationship and something that I&#39;d have to decide was worth the pain.&amp;nbsp;
Understand that the question will come at one point or another.&amp;nbsp; Being a parent means that we have to gradually cede ground on autonomy and independence as the kids age and the true gift is to ascertain when and how much to cede; to say that it&#39;s an imprecise process is an understatement.&amp;nbsp; Take the time now to consider what your guidelines with the kids might be and understand that you and your mate might very well have different expectations on what those might be; my wife is in closer contact to the kids via text than I am while I might go for weeks between texts or phone calls.&amp;nbsp; My own comments have been that I&#39;ll be happy to speak with you whenever you so choose and will answer any questions that you might have...but don&#39;t blindside me with bad news unless it&#39;s truly unexpected.&amp;nbsp; There will be miscommunications and there will be the occasional hard feelings but if you take some time to think about your expectations and go over them in advance, the potential damage can be minimized and you can move on to a newer, more well&#45;defined adult relationship.</body>

<title>So&#8230;What is This Middle Class?</title>
<body>There&#39;s been an ongoing flow of ink and discussion about the decline and potential demise of the American Middle Class, that economic entity in which many Americans were raised.&amp;nbsp; The data over the past seven years has shown material damage to the entity with a drop in median family income as well as a loss in median family assets.&amp;nbsp; A record number of Americans are receiving food assistance, more than 93 million are no longer in the workforce and the discrepancy in wealth distribution is now at a point not seen since the Gilded Age of more than a century ago.&amp;nbsp; My own thinking in the more recent past has been about the questions, what precisely is the American Middle Class and how did it come to exist?&amp;nbsp; When did it become a real thing and what factors led to its rise?&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t believe that you can remedy a situation until you manage to understand it and frankly, focusing on only the economic data is akin to saying that the patient died of massive hemorrhaging when that hemorrhaging was actually caused by multiple gunshots from a Sonny Corleone&#45;style gangland shooting.&amp;nbsp; And yes, that is a purposefully pointed analogy.
What we&#39;re watching now is just a bleeding out from a wounded mass of people, but that hemorrhaging is the result of both purposeful and inadvertant policy decisions that have occurred over the course of decades.&amp;nbsp; This American Middle Class didn&#39;t just arise because a gaggle of World War Two veterans returned home and said Woot!  We survived, so let&#39;s start buying!&amp;nbsp; It arose from the culmination of four principal factors that coalesced together after more than a half&#45;century of oft&#45;times painful development.&amp;nbsp; Had any of these factors not occurred, my belief is that what we&#39;ve come to appreciate and mourn would probably never have existed in the first place and we&#39;d have been no different as a nation than any other developing nation with an intransigent oligarchy.</body>

<title>Civics versus Reality:&nbsp; Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Kids</title>
<body>Part of my job as a father &#45; a parent &#45; is to raise the kids to take their place in the world as moral and productive adults.&amp;nbsp; The conversations continue beyond the birds and the bees, which is good since they&#39;re all old enough that if I were now discussing birds and bees with them, I&#39;d probably have multiple grandchildren.&amp;nbsp; But a significant part of those conversations go to what&#39;s occurring in the world around them and how reality frequently conflicts with what they&#39;ve learned in school.&amp;nbsp; Such is the case with a conversation about the June 12 vote on HR 1314, in which the House of Representatives denied the President the right to &quot;fast&#45;track&quot; approval of the Trans&#45;Pacific Partnership trade treaty.
The conversation happened twice, the first with Middle and again later that evening with Eldest, Youngest and my wife.&amp;nbsp; In each case, it was generally composed of three segments.&amp;nbsp; The first was a general description of what little was known the TPP treaty and that led to the other two segments.&amp;nbsp; Why was so little known about it and how in the hell could the President get away with making open disclosure of such contents prosecutable.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the former, little is known about it and purposefully so.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the most glaring is that supranational rights would be given to corporations, i.e. that if a foreign corporation objected to a local law, be it state or federal, it could appeal that law to an international court and if upheld, could have said law overturned.&amp;nbsp; The example that I used with each was if a Chinese corporation wanted to build a plant in a neighboring township and didn&#39;t like the environmental regulations, they could take their case to an international court and have those regulations overturned so that they could proceed with their plant.&amp;nbsp; Incendiary perhaps, but still a legitimate example and one that&#39;s pertinent since there&#39;s been an ongoing local controversy about an American firm running a gas pipeline through the area despite significant public opposition.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s bad enough that we&#39;re becoming part of a domestic corporate fascism with those organizations gaining increasing power over the individual; to be additionally at the mercy of the wishes of a foreign corporation &#45; be it Chinese, German or English &#45; is intolerable.
The next part of the conversation went to the fact that the document itself is heavily guarded and protected as to contents.&amp;nbsp; It can only be read by members of Congress in a particular basement, guarded, and any notes must be destroyed.&amp;nbsp; If anyone is caught publicizing details of the proposed treaty, they can be criminally prosecuted.&amp;nbsp; Still, aspects of the treaty have made it to light and that includes the supranational status given to corporations.&amp;nbsp; Another aspect that&#39;s come out via leaks and analysis by the New York Times is that the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied heavily on its behalf, most notably for increased intellectual property protection.&amp;nbsp; While that&#39;s certainly a legitimate concern that goes to pharmaceuticals as well as any other number of industries and products, there is also a push for increased control of patents so that generic drugs would take longer to come to market and keep the cost of medications higher for longer than it is now.&amp;nbsp; In a society that&#39;s seeing more medical costs being borne by the consumer as deductibles move higher, this is an additional burden on stretched family budgets in the event of medical difficulty.
The vote itself, which was defeated by a large Democratic House contingent joining with some Republicans, was to approve a &quot;fast track&quot; vote on the bill, whose Senate corollary had already been approved.&amp;nbsp; This fast tracking would&#39;ve forced a straight yes or no vote on the treaty with no debate and with no allowance for any changes whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, Representative Paul Ryan (R) echoed Nancy Pelosi (D) when she spoke the Obamacare vote:  you&#39;ll find out what&#39;s in it after you vote for it.&amp;nbsp; This simple comment was as astounding coming around the second time as it was coming around the first and equally appalling.
The response from all of the kids &#45; Youngest is quite capable of playing up to his elder siblings &#45; was simple disbelief.&amp;nbsp; None of this was what they&#39;d learned about in their Civics classes &#45; or in Youngest&#39;s case, from talking with me &#45; and it was difficult to reconcile with the theory that they&#39;d learned about the fabled American democracy with it&#39;s freedom of speech and constitutional system of checks and balances.&amp;nbsp; And honestly, apart from multiple comments as to unconstitutional, the one word that caught my attention was tyranny.&amp;nbsp;
Tyranny, indeed.&amp;nbsp; And this came from the mouth of a teenager.
So what&#39;s the upshot of all of this?&amp;nbsp; There are several...the first is that the kids are absolutely capable in their teen years of learning and understanding what&#39;s going on in their nation and the world, provided that you&#39;re willing to take the time to talk with them.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fine if you tell them to turn off their electronics for a few minutes of discussion, although the first time or two that you do it will seem more like a monologue than a dialogue.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s important that you get your salient facts straight and present them with as little rancor as possible, even if you should be wrapping your head with duct tape to keep it from exploding, so that you don&#39;t come off as the foaming&#45;at&#45;the&#45;mouth old man.&amp;nbsp; And the last is that you have an obligation as a parent, like it or not, to stay apprised of what&#39;s going on in the world around you.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t enough anymore to feed and clothe them anymore.&amp;nbsp; There are events and movements within this country that will require our greater attention and activism &#45; yes, I said it &#45; if we&#39;re going to give them a nation worthy of them.</body>

<title>When Real-Time Economics Hits Home</title>
<body>I live for teachable moments and the unfortunate reality is that larger macroeconomic issues do hit here within the household.&amp;nbsp; Such is the case with Eldest, who&#39;s forking away as much into savings as possible for the coming year.
The larger issue is obviously the transition from a sustainable living wage economy to one of predominantly part&#45;time jobs.&amp;nbsp; According to the government statistics &#45; and I&#39;ll admit to believing that a fair portion of the government reporting structure is rigged &#45; there have been millions of jobs created within the past several years yet the majority of them are only part&#45;time, sans the benefits which many of the previous generations received.&amp;nbsp; The scenario simply beggars the imagination and I recently asked Middle, the AP economics student, to explain how we could a record number of Americans both on food assistance as well as out of the workforce yet have what some economists might consider as full employment with a rate of &#45; at that time &#45; 5.4%.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, he did identify ask whether the jobs were full&#45;time and that led to some conversation and explanation about employment statistics...most especially that once a person had any kind of job, even a part&#45;time job at 15 hours weekly, they were no longer considered as unemployed and therefore out of the unemployment rate calculation.&amp;nbsp; And this is where the problem lies:  that we&#39;re now reaping the globalization policy effects as sustainable living jobs for the typical person have been outsourced to other nations.
It was a short conversation with Eldest the other morning about when she was working over the next two days, since the body count is always a factor in dinner plans.&amp;nbsp; She updated me on her hours and expressed frustration with one of her employers.&amp;nbsp; I have to give her credit since she&#39;s willing to work and puts in time at two separate jobs, one within the restaurant business and the other within retail.&amp;nbsp; She successfully schedules her hours and is able to routinely work more than 45 hours weekly and on some weeks has surpassed 55 hours of work; it was the same last summer when she put in similar hours albeit only with the restaurant.&amp;nbsp; The difference that she&#39;s finding however, is that as a non&#45;server employee at the restaurant, she was paid hourly instead of wait&#45;staff rates and the hours that she garnered &#45; because she routinely picked up every other employee&#39;s shift request &#45; meant that she made significant overtime.&amp;nbsp; So significant that when the management finally reviewed their records late last August, they found that labor costs had risen beyond budgeted because of all of her overtime pay.&amp;nbsp; Their conversation with her was actually gentle since they recognized that they had a keeper as a hostess but the message was clear &#45; no overtime for you!.&amp;nbsp; That carried over into their hiring for this current summer as they hired sufficient numbers for hosts and hostesses that the ability to garner overtime would be simply impossible.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s crazy, Eldest commented, since there are hosts who might only work for one or two shifts each week...I mean, it&#39;s stupid.&amp;nbsp; I went to the question of why they might do that and once she got past the irritability of it&#39;s perceived stupidity, we got to the meat of labor costs.&amp;nbsp; They have a budget within which they have to keep and the unfortunate reality is that it&#39;s presently a fully&#45;blown employer&#39;s market with a surplus of available labor to meet needs; that it&#39;s not at all uncommon for employers to now have an excess number of employees available so that fewer shifts can be given to many and any possible overtime avoided.&amp;nbsp; That paid benefits might only go to those few who actually work more than 40 hours weekly makes it a two&#45;fer as almost nobody hits that mark and that aspect of labor costs is dropped from the bottom line.&amp;nbsp; Her bottom line is that she&#39;s seeing how the same number of hours worked at two jobs leads to less money because the overtime differential is gone.&amp;nbsp; The conversation petered out as she prepared to leave to meet with a friend but she did take the commentary in and I suspect that she&#39;s processed it.
There&#39;s been a recurrent point that bothers me.&amp;nbsp; We live in a society that&#39;s been parsed and segmented and all of the various news media play to their own fan base.&amp;nbsp; MSNBC, Fox and CNN all have their various segments and much of the commentary goes to the notion of them, that others are either the cause or the effect of one policy or another.&amp;nbsp; But the simple truth is that what&#39;s occurring around us isn&#39;t happening to them, it&#39;s happening to us and in many cases, the us is our children since they have to live with the effects of the various corporate policies as they play out.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not your kids or my kids, it&#39;s our kids.&amp;nbsp; The more that we can recognize the larger issues within our own daily lives, the more that we can teach them and help them learn to navigate this system of ours.&amp;nbsp; And hopefully create the template for change that&#39;s more positive because it&#39;s sometimes the little things that cumulatively make a larger difference.
Like a college kid&#39;s willingness to work overtime.</body>

<title>A View From the Ridge,&nbsp; Part 6</title>
<body>As I&#39;ve said before, parenting is a forest for the trees experience.&amp;nbsp; Toddlers become children and grow, become active and engaged in the world around them, and the plethora of life can narrow your view to the immediate moments of this day and the next, akin to the trees in a thick wood.&amp;nbsp; But there are moments when the foliage opens and you recognize that you&#39;re on a ridge with a view that spans for miles; you&#39;re now allowed to get a glimpse of the wider vista and can see both forward and back.
Such a moment was the other night when Middle donned cap and gown to receive his high school diploma.&amp;nbsp; The event was held at a local college&#39;s sporting complex to accommodate the graduates and their thousands of parents, family and friends.&amp;nbsp; Having to help with an elderly relative, Eldest was dispatched with her boyfriend  to the venue as soon as doors opened in order to claim seats that would require minimal walking.&amp;nbsp; Middle went to the high school around dinnertime to join his peers on the school buses that would carry them to the ceremony and his girlfriend arrived shortly after that to join us for the graduation.&amp;nbsp; Youngest &#45; decked out in suit and bow tie &#45; was tasked with assisting his elders while I spent an undue amount of time finding parking after dropping everybody off at the site.
But once I was finally in and seated, able to cut across to my seat about 40 yards ahead of the processing seniors, I took a deep breath and in a few moments was able to enjoy the trailhead and distant scenery.&amp;nbsp; Turning around on the ridge, I looked behind to see how our family&#39;s trail had narrowed somewhat when Eldest graduated and went off to college herself.&amp;nbsp; I could see how older trails were meandering along from a distance until they more closely paralleled ours and far closer, how Eldest&#39;s trail had once again returned to ours for a short period.&amp;nbsp; When I swung my view forward, I could see the older trails still paralleling ours for the indeterminate period and how our own path was narrowing yet again as Middle left in one direction for college and Eldest returned to her own college.&amp;nbsp; These separate paths wouldn&#39;t necessarily be far away but they would at times be hidden from our view and we could only hope that the kids were sufficiently well&#45;raised and prepared that they&#39;d successfully forge ahead without undue mishap.&amp;nbsp; As I surveyed our terrain ahead, the two parallel paths &#45; ours and our elders &#45; once again led into the woods although it&#39;s certain that the forest isn&#39;t as thick as it had been in the past twenty&#45;one years.
The ceremony ended within two hours and another 264 adults&#45;in&#45;training took their place.&amp;nbsp; Apart from my own son&#39;s appearance in cap and gown, what struck me was the ovation given to the 13 graduates who were moving on to military service.&amp;nbsp; I could only utter a silent prayer on their behalf as they took their place in the armed forces, serving where sent.&amp;nbsp; They entered for various reasons, ranging from the desire to travel, gain specialized education or just serve their country and yet my fear is that the civilian leadership is incapable of using them wisely and stretching them to a point at which they break, either individually or en masse.&amp;nbsp; Their own landscape will be more fraught with pitfalls and potentially darker than that of their peers.
We&#39;re now back into the woods as the older kids come and go with jobs and friends while Youngest enjoys the final summers before he will also begin his journey into the work experience.&amp;nbsp; But take the opportunity to step back whenever you can to see where you are and what&#39;s around you...the view can be magnificent.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - June 2015:&nbsp; Crashing</title>
<body>Let&#39;s divorce ourselves from the notion that the PracticalDad Price Index monitors the pricing activity of a fairly typical family marketbasket from a grocery store &#45; or three separate and unrelated stores as in the case of the Index.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s say that the figures represent an unknown something that could just as easily be good as bad.&amp;nbsp; Now assume that the figures have risen from a baseline of 100 to a high of 115.33 over a period of 49 months, a rise carved with ups and downs but generally following an upwards trend.&amp;nbsp; If you were to find that this increase over a 49 month period was eliminated by more than one half &#45; 57% to be exact &#45; in just six months, how would you describe it?&amp;nbsp; A drop?&amp;nbsp; A decline?&amp;nbsp; A fall?&amp;nbsp; A collapse?&amp;nbsp; A crash?&amp;nbsp; The wording can be argued but my gut response is that it would be akin to a crash, a sudden crunching of the upwards slope in such a way as to suggest that said curve ran headlong into a concrete abutment and folded in upon itself.
Such is the case with the June 2015 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index as the Total Index fell yet again to 107.11 in June from May&#39;s previous reading of 107.56 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; This is the fourth decline in six months from the December 2014 level of 111.18.&amp;nbsp; But whereas the Total Index covers all 47 items in the marketbasket, what has grabbed my attention is the simple collapse of the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index, which consists of the 37 foodstuff items within the larger 47 item marketbasket.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this sub&#45;index (again, November 2010 = 100) which has historically shown the effects of price increases and decreases, while the non&#45;food items have, for the most part, been generally controlled.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index reached it&#39;s zenith in December 2014 at 115.33; yet it subsequently began a steepening slide that led to June&#39;s Sub&#45;Index reading of 106.46.&amp;nbsp; This is the crash to which I&#39;m referring in the title &#45; that fully 57% of prices increasing over four and a half years has been wiped away in six months.&amp;nbsp; Yes, a pound of 80% ground beef is still high and the rising price of a dozen large eggs is starting to show the effect of the spreading Avian influenza through the national poultry flocks but these supply and demand issues are being played out against price declines in other foodstuffs as deflationary pressures come into play in a complex and dynamic process.
So what is this deflationary pressure and how is it playing out in the stores?
Understand that the price changes in inflation (upward) and deflation (downward) are symptomatic of other underlying issues and in the case of deflation, the biggest underlying issue is the amount of money flowing through the economy; in the case of most, that flow would come from the family income.&amp;nbsp; The Fed, and other central banks, are terrified of deflation and want inflation.&amp;nbsp; Their premise is that rising prices mean that producers and manufacturers can charge more for their products and then in turn pass that along to their employees via higher wages or hiring of more people &#45; in the ideal world, both would happen &#45; and these happy employees would feel wealthier and more comfortable.&amp;nbsp; That would then lead to greater spending by the employees and their families, meaning that more would then flow back to the producers and manufacturers and the cycle would continue.&amp;nbsp; The policy response of the central banks is framed by their predecessors&#39; experience during the Great Depression of 1929 in which deflation ruled the day.&amp;nbsp; Businesses lost complete control of their capacity to maintain pricing as consumers lost their money and cut back on spending; as spending was curbed, less was bought and businesses were forced to lower their prices to compete with the result that the employees weren&#39;t receiving higher pay.&amp;nbsp; As they didn&#39;t see wage increases and saw other businesses slowly shutter, they in turn cut back on spending further to protect themselves and businesses saw even fewer sales, meaning even more downward pressures.&amp;nbsp; The result was a highly negative reinforcing cycle that culminated in a quarter of the American workforce unemployed and thousands of businesses and banks shuttered forever.&amp;nbsp; So the ability to control pricing is key and that in turn depends upon the ability of people to spend and that ultimately depends upon people having something to spend in the first place.
That&#39;s lovely...but how does that theory seem to be playing out in the grocery stores?&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve seen over the past several months appears to be significant changes in pricing strategy.&amp;nbsp; The backdrop to all of this is that the median family income is dropping across the country and that&#39;s compounded by the burgeoning number of Americans now receiving food assistance, so the money flow simply isn&#39;t there as it was several years ago.&amp;nbsp; There was a period within the past decade in which grocery stores upgraded themselves with coffee kiosks and delis, enlarging and appealing to a more upscale clientele.&amp;nbsp; As the money flows out of the general economy however, people feel less inclined to spend and the cosmetic changes matter less and the stores&#39; ability to compete is increasingly reduced to bareknuckle price competition.&amp;nbsp; During the first quarter, one grocery store in the survey, owned by an international chain, instituted an &quot;Everyday Low Pricing&quot; policy with a lower price on multiple common foodstuff items.&amp;nbsp; Meat, a supply&#45;and&#45;demand affected item, was still expensive but from one month to the next, items such as bananas and potatos, canned vegetables, and other foodstuffs underwent significant price decreases.&amp;nbsp; Approximately two months later, another grocer &#45; an independent but one which whose generic brand is produced by a national chain on behalf of independents &#45; began a wholesale switch to another generic brand producer and the prices on multiple foodstuff items underwent a corresponding decline.&amp;nbsp; This particular change is still playing out in the store as they still sell the discontinued generic brand and will do so until their inventory is exhausted, at which point I anticipate that they&#39;ll offer only the new generic label; it&#39;s happened before and I expect it to happen again.&amp;nbsp; The remaining grocer is a regional grocery chain and has had difficulty maintaining prices relative to the two competitors and until this month, I hadn&#39;t seen much different in terms of their pricing.&amp;nbsp; What I observed the other day during the pricing however, was a number of lower priced items in the marketbasket and in those cases, there was also signage indicating a new &quot;everyday low pricing&quot; policy.&amp;nbsp; This was particularly the case with lunchmeat, deli cheese and bananas as the minimum drop amongst the three items was 20%.&amp;nbsp; In the case of this third grocery chain, I know from first hand experience that they&#39;ve had profitability issues and have dealt with it by closing stores and reducing hours at other locations.&amp;nbsp; The evidence suggests to me that despite these issues, they&#39;re having to compete with the others now on the price front.
So the evidence suggests that amongst the falling income/money flow through the general economy, the three grocers are now competing on a price front &#45; much as their Depressionary forebears did 75 years ago.&amp;nbsp; If this income situation isn&#39;t somehow rectified in the relatively near future, the prospect is that the grocers will lose control of their pricing in a deflationary spiral and one or more will fail and the first will be that one which doesn&#39;t have the sufficient buying power that comes from larger entities.&amp;nbsp; For example, which would you consider to fail first &#45; Walmart or Joe&#39;s corner grocery?&amp;nbsp; Because people aren&#39;t spending and making money course through the economy, the prospect exists that one or more of these grocers will fail &#45; and this fear of more failing businesses is the rationale behind the policies of the central banks.&amp;nbsp; It is also the fear behind Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath&#39;s likely to be infamous letter to American consumers.
One final note when you look at the Indices results from December 2014 through June 2015.&amp;nbsp; The column entitled &quot;Spread&quot; pertains to the differential between the Total Index reading and the reading for the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index.&amp;nbsp; I began to use it some time ago since I found it helpful to indicate the level of activity on the part of the Sub&#45;Index versus the entire Index.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll note that as of December 2014, the spread between the two readings was 3.95 basis points and was positive because the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index had risen that much higher in comparison to it&#39;s Total Index companion.&amp;nbsp; But over the past six months, this spread has declined significantly and consistently until June 2015 when the spread was actually (.65), meaning that the Total Index was now actually higher than the Sub&#45;Index...something that hasn&#39;t happened before in the four and a half year history of the PracticalDad Price Index.&amp;nbsp; Yes folks, food prices &#45; as measured on a marketbasket basis &#45; are now dropping.

<title>...here at the end of all things</title>
<body>I&#39;m glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Frodo Baggins
For the last time in more than 2300 mornings, Middle once again came down to breakfast for a quick bite to eat before departing for school.&amp;nbsp; I commented that this was effectively the last day of school for him as his classes ended and he only had an amusement park class trip and graduation practice before donning cap and gown.&amp;nbsp; He sipped at his drink and quoted a line from Peter Jackson&#39;s Return of the King: I&#39;m glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.&amp;nbsp; Standing and working at the kitchen sink, I nodded and responded, Except that this isn&#39;t an end, son.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a beginning.&amp;nbsp; He could only concur.
And for him, it is a beginning.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s still a teenager with that breed&#39;s sensibilities &#45; or occasional lack thereof &#45; and sense of invincibility and confidence.&amp;nbsp; In less than three months, he will join his two best friends at an urban university to study and pursue his love, acting.&amp;nbsp; And then my wife and I will be left only with Youngest in the house, still in middle school but rapidly growing and maturing; I can now look into his eyes without having to lower my face and as my wife stated in a conversation to another he really is an old soul.
But while it&#39;s a beginning for Middle, neither is it an end for my wife and I.&amp;nbsp; It is instead a transition for us as he takes first steps of independence and adulthood.&amp;nbsp; He bears some of the stamps of adulthood already, both being able to vote and serve in the military yet he&#39;s only now an adult&#45;in&#45;training.&amp;nbsp; He will leave for college and I expect that there will be the periodic phone calls and questions about procedures, processes and situations as he continues the process of maturation.&amp;nbsp; God knows that my own father received more than his fair share as I witnessed and waded through episodes of what can charitably be described as debauchery during my freshman year of college &#45; Dear God, Dad...how do I handle this kind of thing? &#45; and even beyond.&amp;nbsp; It also leads to a more general question, and that is how I myself wish to see this relationship as we both age.&amp;nbsp; As he joins his elder sister in moving along and upwards on the Bell Curve of maturity and capability, it&#39;s obviously apparent that my own position on the same curve is not on an upwards trajectory.&amp;nbsp; Middle&#45;age is a time when a person is generally moving along a plateau of physical, emotional and intellectual capabilities before the gradual effects of age take their own toll, although at differing rates for each of capabilities.&amp;nbsp; 50 is the new 35?&amp;nbsp; Yeah, but only with sufficient quantities of Ibuprofen and Scotch and occasionally in combination...&amp;nbsp; Sprinkle in an awareness of the effects of advanced old age from being sandwiched and it becomes a question with a bit more emotional immediacy even if it&#39;s unlikely that I&#39;ll find myself in a similar situation.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t even be surprised if you and your mate each sees a different answer to the relationship question.&amp;nbsp; The point is that it&#39;s something worth considering since it&#39;s obvious that you won&#39;t want it to end and yet, it cannot remain the same.
I&#39;m fortunate in that this relationship change is already taking place with Eldest, even though I&#39;m not certain quite how it would be described; I only know that it&#39;s different and as long as we both are satisfied with it, that&#39;s alright.
Perhaps Tolkien&#39;s classic trilogy is a good analogy for what&#39;s taking place.&amp;nbsp; In the end, Frodo and Sam survived with their relationship matured.&amp;nbsp; Each better understood the other and had a renewed respect for what each had accomplished on the journey.&amp;nbsp; Raising a child is a long, long journey but with every journey, there&#39;s a beginning and an end.&amp;nbsp; What happens when that journey together ends isn&#39;t written in stone at the beginning but it&#39;s something that will be slowly carved when the next step of their journey begins.&amp;nbsp; By this time, your child is in some ways an adult and is capable of viewing life and relationships with a fairly astute eye; to think that their next steps will entail the exact same relationship with you as when they were children will only assure an ugly carving, if one is carved at all.</body>

<title>Cashless America:&nbsp; The Kids&#8217; Perspective (Part 2)</title>
<body>Note:  This is a follow&#45;up to a previous article &#45; Cashless America:  The Set&#45;Up &#45; which recently ran on the site.&amp;nbsp; The two were originally meant to be one article focusing on the response of my two older kids, Eldest and Middle, but it made more sense to split it into two pieces, the first of which briefly laid out the gist of the arguments from proponents of moving to a digital, cashless currency.&amp;nbsp; Now I&#39;ll get on to the kids&#39; perspectives.
After reading a spate of articles about the notion of abolishing physical currency, I thought that it would be interesting to see what Eldest and Middle thought of the concept.&amp;nbsp; Eldest is a rising college senior home from a semester abroad, intent on making bank for the coming year.&amp;nbsp; Middle is a high school senior who will leave for college in the Fall and is now finishing AP Economics (which, if you&#39;ve ever read the supporting textbook, is a certifiable cure for insomnia and has absolutely no bearing on anything approaching reality for nascent adults).
Middle was first up as he was first down for breakfast and I prefaced my question with the caveat that I&#39;d simply like a cogent response by the evening...just take a little time through the day to think about this and if I could have a response by evening, that would be great...&amp;nbsp; The question was this:  what would you think if our nation moved to a simple digital currency with all transactions and accounts managed digitally?&amp;nbsp; There would no longer be any physical currency, bill or coin, for use. &amp;nbsp; To be fair, as much as it pains me, some of the proponents only want to do with large denominations above $50 or $100 bills...others however, want all currency removed.&amp;nbsp; His response was truly surprising in its immediacy:  That would be terrible.&amp;nbsp; TERRIBLE if that happened.&amp;nbsp; His first reason was about safety.&amp;nbsp; Events have shown that anything &#45; Dad, ANYTHING can be hacked &#45; could be hacked with sufficient ingenuity and resources and it would be conceivable that everything could be simply gone in a nanosecond.&amp;nbsp; After that comment, he then covered his right eye with his right hand and making an &#39;O&#39; with his left thumb and index finger, placed them over the left eye.&amp;nbsp; I looked at him blankly and he simply said Big Brother.&amp;nbsp; He didn&#39;t want everything to be available for viewing, nor did he want any and all of his transactions to be traceable.&amp;nbsp;That kind of power shouldn&#39;t be available to the government nor to the corporations.
Eldest came down later before heading off to work and received the same preface about taking time and then the question, and her response was surprisingly immediate as well.&amp;nbsp; She likewise disliked the notion for the same reason about safety, noting again that anything digital can be hacked.&amp;nbsp; The kids are the products of the online digital age, with a far greater grasp of its benefits and faults that those of us who came of age in the analog era and her first thought went to how all a person&#39;s financial eggs shouldn&#39;t be kept in one digital basket.&amp;nbsp; As she stood there, her next response was something that I had simply never considered.&amp;nbsp; It would really make it hard for illegal immigrants here, though.&amp;nbsp; When I asked why, she responded None of them have bank accounts and their transactions are usually done in cash because they don&#39;t want to bring attention to themselves; then they send the money home via money orders...so it would have a massive impact on immigration.&amp;nbsp; It was then that I recalled that part of her classwork during the semester abroad pertained to studies of immigration, illegal and legal, and that she&#39;d actually had conversations with both immigrants as well as members of the US Border Patrol.&amp;nbsp; The comment about the impact upon illegal immigration was something that I&#39;d never even considered although I expect that the ability to more effectively control illegal immigration would certainly be an argument on behalf of a fully digital currency.
I did have a short conversation about Cyprus and the use of the &quot;bail&#45;in&quot; to manage the bank recapitalization, explaining it briefly to Middle; he confirmed that he understood since he already understood the concept of the bail&#45;out as practiced here in 2008.&amp;nbsp; He commented that it sounded like a socialist thing to do whereupon I asked where the original concept originated; when I told him that it first came about from a combined effort of the FDIC and the Bank of England, his response was concise and rude.&amp;nbsp; Please understand one key point about your status as a retail depositor in a bank:&amp;nbsp; after the financial crisis of 2008, legislation was passed that effectively shifted the status of the retail depositor &#45; you and your kids&#39; bank accounts &#45; from that of a protected entity in the event of the institution&#39;s difficulties to that of an unsecured creditor.&amp;nbsp; There is a legal hierarchy in the business world of who has greater risk in the event of bankruptcy and thus stands first in line to lose their money should liquidation be required.&amp;nbsp; In the pre&#45;2008 world, the retail depositor was protected at the rear of the line but the passed legislation now equated the retail depositor to that of an unsecured creditor &#45; someone who simply loaned money to the bank without asking for collateral &#45; and moved you to the head of the line.&amp;nbsp; So even if your bank is small and well&#45;managed, another financial firestorm will put your deposits in the crosshairs should the government move to a bail&#45;in approach.
Oh, and by the way...when the Dodd&#45;Frank Bill was passed in 2010 as a response to financial crisis, it made another reclassification.&amp;nbsp; The banking system &#45; predominantly the Too Big To Fail banks&#45; have been heavily involved in highly profitable derivatives trading; that bill shifted the status of derivative counter&#45;parties to that of supercreditor so that they are first in line to receive monies that are redistributed in the event of a bail&#45;in.&amp;nbsp; In other words, we are at the head of the line for liquidation and they are at the head of the other line for reimbursement.&amp;nbsp; Lovely, isn&#39;t is?
And that is at the heart of the cashless proposal.&amp;nbsp; The thrust is to move as much money as possible back into the banking system so that in the event of another Lehman style event, there is sufficient capital available to reconstitute the financial system and make good the losses via bail&#45;in before having to go to the government via the bail&#45;out.&amp;nbsp; It is about expanding the number of unsecured creditors and controlling their funds by eliminating their ability to move their money out of the system to protect themselves.&amp;nbsp; The fact that the institutions are never fully protected from digital intrusion and theft is serious; both of the kids are right in that there&#39;s always a way to hack the system.&amp;nbsp; But the issue here is purely and simply control, control of assets and control of the redistribution of those assets should worse come to worse.&amp;nbsp; And as to the immigration aspect that Eldest raised:&amp;nbsp; it isn&#39;t a key aspect to the proposal but I expect that if this cashless currency proposal gains legs, it will certainly be trotted out as a beneficial side&#45;effect to help control the illegal immigration problem.
The kids aren&#39;t stupid, they can see what could happen.&amp;nbsp; But it requires a conscious effort on your part as a parent to periodically pull them out of the Matrix and explain things to them.&amp;nbsp; Do it on car rides, do it at the dinner table, do it in the moments when you might be just sitting together.&amp;nbsp; Create small bits of knowledge as informational pebbles to add to their pile and do so purposefully through the years.&amp;nbsp; There will come a time when they&#39;re older that they can begin to take the pile and build structures of their own that might surprise you.&amp;nbsp; That also means that you have to pay attention as well.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Cashless America:&nbsp; The Set-Up (Part 1)</title>
<body>PracticalDad Note:  There&#39;s been considerable and increasing talk within the past month about the notion of banning all physical currency.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of more&#45;experienced than mine with information out there, but this article started as commentary from my two older kids when I explained the digital currency notion to them.&amp;nbsp; The article ultimately became too lengthy and I decided to split it into two parts, the first &#45; this part &#45; being the set&#45;up on the cashless America concept.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll follow shortly with the take&#45;away from Eldest and Middle in another article with some responses that surprised me.
There have been a spate of articles and interviews within the past several months about the concept of doing away completely with physical currency in the American economy and moving to a purely digital currency.&amp;nbsp; Articles and papers have come forward from several influential sources and in late March, Janet Yellen &#45; the chair of the Federal Reserve &#45; made a comment that questioned whether physical currency such as coins and bills was actually a worthwhile store of value.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s obviously an idea that&#39;s being passed around the Ivory Towers and Hallowed Halls of Power, so certain folks are going to take a run at making this the wave of the future.&amp;nbsp; But radical ideas such as these take time and so I thought that I&#39;d get the input of Eldest and Middle since it&#39;s their rising generation that will be affected the most.&amp;nbsp;
For the record, Eldest is a rising college senior who has by now not only traveled abroad, but studied abroad as well and is now home to replenish the bank accounts before returning for the final year of college.&amp;nbsp; Middle is her younger sibling, a high school senior who has likewise traveled abroad and is in the midst of AP Economics, much to his chagrin.&amp;nbsp; He initially thought that it would be fun given some of the conversations about money and real world that we&#39;ve had over the years but now believes &#45; as I do after perusing his text and notes &#45; that it really is not much more than mental masturbation.&amp;nbsp; So the other morning, I asked them to take some time through the course of their day to consider the following question:&amp;nbsp; what would be your thoughts on eliminating all physical currency and moving to a purely digital currency, with transactions managed solely by the use of debit cards?&amp;nbsp;
Let&#39;s take a moment first to look at what&#39;s being proposed.&amp;nbsp; The initial concept was posited by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff in a 2014 paper, Costs and benefits to phasing out currency.&amp;nbsp; According to Rogoff, there are two principal reasons for the gradual and final abolition of physical currency.&amp;nbsp;
The first goes to providing additional firepower to central banks in their effort to spur inflation to rates of about 2%.&amp;nbsp; A core tenet of present monetary theory is that a moderated inflation &#45; no more than about 2% &#45; is a good thing as gradually rising prices enable producers to continue to hire and pass along rising wages to workers, who then spend that money and help perpetuate what is, in theory, a virtuous cycle.&amp;nbsp; Note:  This is the theory and ignores such real world effects as free&#45;trade globalization, currency pegs/manipulation, and all of the things that actually occur in the real world.&amp;nbsp; As the global economy has tried to recover in the years since the Financial Crisis and the collapse of Lehman &#45; when a monstrous amount of capital was utterly destroyed &#45; the numerous central banks have created a tsunami of liquidity in order to offset deflationary pressures and hopefully create a moderated inflation that meets the core tenet.&amp;nbsp; Deflation is feared because in the experience of the Great Depression, producers lost control of all pricing power and were largely driven out of business, feeding the unemployment as more and more jobs were eliminated.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;ve since gone through an extended number of years of Zero Interest Rate Policy, aka ZIRP and the ability of the central banks to use interest rates as an effective tool against this deflationary environment is reaching what is referred to the effective lower bound.&amp;nbsp; In terms that any kid taking AP Economics would learn is that there is no longer any marginal value to changes in rates, although certain European nations and the EU are pursuing Negative Interest Rate Policy as the banks are now charged by the central banks for keeping deposits.&amp;nbsp; The concept behind this stunning bizarro policy &#45; which thoroughly upends literally millenia of conventional wisdom touting the value of saving &#45; is that spending must be spurred and money must not be kept as savings, but instead forced out into the economy in order to be spent and spur economic activity.&amp;nbsp;
Understand a central concept here:&amp;nbsp; a dollar bill is not just called currency, but also referred to in econo&#45;speak as a &quot;Zero&#45;Interest Negotiable Bond&quot;.&amp;nbsp; It is a piece of paper that pays the bearer absolutely no interest whatsoever but can be easily traded from one user to another in the course of daily economic life.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that as interest rates approach zero, there is no longer any real impetus to keep money in the bank but instead, to just go ahead and keep it under the mattress or even use it in lieu of credit cards which actually have high rates when contrasted with the rates available for various savings products.&amp;nbsp; But as rates not only approach zero but actually go below zero into negative interest territory &#45; in reality, where the banks are presently charged for keeping money on deposit and have simply not yet passed that cost onto the retail depositor &#45; then the average person will conceivably ignore the banking system and save money by simply removing their money from the banks completely.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that a larger percentage of total money is then outside of the banking system and beyond control of the central banks, even further lessening the tools that they have to affect the economy.
The second aspect of the Rogoff proposal is that an outsize proportion of illegal and/or unreportable&#45;tax transactions are handled via physical currency.&amp;nbsp; Pay cash for a used vehicle for instance, but report a smaller amount than actually paid via cash in order to mitigate state sales tax when title is transferred; because there&#39;s no actual check to serve as documentation, cash can conceivably hide money from the tax coffers.&amp;nbsp; So eliminating all physical currency transactions means that all transactions thus occur within a monitorable system, eliminating the prospect of illegality and tax fraud.&amp;nbsp; The sop to this aspect is the same sop to critics of electronic domestic surveillance &#45; this would only affect criminals and cheats and honest, law&#45;abiding citizens would have no worry since they&#39;re doing nothing wrong.&amp;nbsp: Given the weaponization of such agencies as the IRS, I&#39;m not certain that I&#39;m the least bit comfortable with that surmise.
There&#39;s another aspect of this that bothers me, and that pertains to the financial solution to the Cyprus banking crisis of several years ago.&amp;nbsp; As a recap, the Cypriot banking system &#45; a favorite offshore banking location for wealthy Russian oligarchs &#45; ran into problems and was on the verge of collapse.&amp;nbsp; But instead of a government sponsored bailout as in the US, circa 2008, the Cypriot government pushed through a &quot;bail&#45;in&quot; in which bank depositors were forced to give up a portion of their deposits to help keep the banks afloat.&amp;nbsp; In their ideal world, the hit would&#39;ve been on the large Russian depositors with smaller depositors saved but in our present system, in which the uber&#45;wealthy have access to cash and information, the Russians had largely removed their funds by the time that knife fell and while the smallest depositors were exempted, the original targets had all moved onwards to safer grazing territory.&amp;nbsp; This might sound faintly interesting but for the realization that the &quot;bail&#45;in&quot; concept was originally floated by the FDIC, the US governmental agency tasked with insuring bank deposits.&amp;nbsp; The notion was that there had to be a better way than just spending more government money and that better way was found with the depositors.&amp;nbsp; So bear with me here:  if you&#39;re worried about the bank on a very short term basis, as happens during a good, old&#45;fashioned bank run, your option is to pull out the money as cash and keep it safe under the mattress.&amp;nbsp; But if there&#39;s a cashless society, then the only place to move your money is to another institution since there would be currency.&amp;nbsp; You are, in effect, effectively trapped within a system that could decide it was better off to use the depositors money in the form of a &quot;bail&#45;in&quot; of teetering banks.&amp;nbsp; And if you think that the pain would be spread amongst everyone, remember that the uber&#45;wealthy depositors in Cyprus had most of their money removed by the time that the ball dropped on the bail&#45;in.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Kids and the Public Use of Cellphones</title>
<body>Tonight was an interesting evening since my better half and I had dinner at the restaurant at which both Eldest and Middle work.&amp;nbsp; The fact that they literally work side by side as head hostess and host is fascinating enough as she will be training him, but when they were out of sight doing their jobs, I took the opportunity to watch the other diners; I am a natural observer spawned by spending childhood vacation evenings seated on boardwalk benches because my folks wouldn&#39;t pay for ride tickets.&amp;nbsp; But what grabbed my attention was visual proof of the cellphone spread discussed in multiple newspaper and magazine articles.
Across the way from our outside table was a large group of almost a dozen people, mixed between girls in their mid&#45;teens and middle&#45;aged men.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m 99.999% certain that they were father/daughter combinations but knowing that there&#39;s a large swingers group that meets for a monthly social hour at this restaurant &#45; and boy howdy, ain&#39;t that an educational conversation with the kids &#45; I&#39;ll hold the .001% in reserve.&amp;nbsp; What was notable however was the prevalence of smartphones and cellphones in active use amongst the group and not just among the girls.&amp;nbsp; The girls would share their smartphones back and forth, taking selfies and ostensibly trolling the web as they waited.&amp;nbsp; But I was surprised to see multiple adults also pull their devices to answer and/or make calls, or likewise swipe their screens.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not uncommon for large groups seated in restaurants to break into smaller conversational nodes because the ambient noise makes it difficult for one end of the table to hear the other, but this scene was played out amongst other tables which had far fewer diners.&amp;nbsp; It was honestly depressing to see people turn away from one another to answer texts or swipe screens to follow whatever on the available wi&#45;fi network.
So how does affect the family and kids?&amp;nbsp; There have certainly been moments in our household when any one of us &#45; and even Youngest now has a basic phone &#45; has reached into a pocket to glance at something incoming; it happened to me yesterday in a meeting.&amp;nbsp; But that&#39;s a function of the press of other responsibilities and commitments and even teens with jobs and activities have them.&amp;nbsp; But pulling out the phone to glance and then replacing it isn&#39;t the same thing as the wholesale process of ignoring your table companions, a tacit insult if ever there was one.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been clear since kids&#39; cell phones were first introduced into the house that they had no place at the family dinner table and we&#39;ve tried to hold the line on that, even if one of them still will periodically pull it out to respond quickly to something that&#39;s incoming.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an ongoing and chronic occurrence but at least it&#39;s not a wholesale conversation and when a comment is made about it, there&#39;s no rancorous response.&amp;nbsp; I know of families who require that all cell phones be removed before dinner in order to maintain balance and assure that there&#3#39;s an opportunity to engage in even a short period of uninterrupted conversation, free of distraction.&amp;nbsp; The flip side to this is that you have to be willing to purposefully put away your own device so that you&#39;re abiding by the rule as well.&amp;nbsp; There have been moments in my parenting experience when I&#39;ve responded to but you don&#39;t follow that rule with the I&#39;m your father, I don&#39;t always have to  response but it seems to me that this is one of those rules that should be universally respected.&amp;nbsp; The sole exceptions in the household are my Better Half, who is a physician and subject to any number of situations requiring immediate attention and the common awareness of everyone that there&#39;s an illness in a member of the extended family, particularly the elderly relatives.&amp;nbsp; If those aren&#39;t operative however, then the usual reminder is to put the devices away.
There&#39;s value in upholding the rules about cellphones here.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s tremendous value in knowing how to hold and maintain a conversation with another person as well as like value in being able to follow a thought process without distraction.&amp;nbsp; The challenges facing our country are numerous, deep and varied and if the kids aren&#39;t capable of thinking with clarity, depth and focus, then the situations will grow insoluble, at least in a manner that&#39;s satisfactory to a democracy with a functioning constitution.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - May 2015:&nbsp; Food Price Declines Resume</title>
<body>The May 2015 pricing for the PracticalDad Price Index was finished the other day and after a month in which the decline ceased, May showed a major resumption of the Index&#39;s drop.&amp;nbsp; The basket&#39;s Total Index for May 2015 stood at 107.56, a decrease from April&#39;s Total Index of 108.21 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; But the 37 foodstuff item Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index dropped precipitously from April&#39;s 110.20 to May&#39;s 107.74 (November 2010 = 100); were it not for an outlying 43% increase in the average price of a box of non&#45;food kitchen trash bags, the Total Index would also have dropped more precipitously from April&#39;s level.
For a better perspective on what&#39;s happening with the marketbasket &#45; particularly the foodstuffs such as meat, dairy and produce &#45; consider this about the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index.&amp;nbsp; It took four years and a month for the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index of 37 items to rise to it&#39;s highest point in December, 2014.&amp;nbsp; At that time, it stood at it&#39;s apex level of 115.13 (November 2010 = 100), so that the same basket of 37 separate food items had risen by 15.13% from the baseline in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; Within a period of five consecutive months, that sub&#45;index&#39;s rise has fully collapsed by almost one half &#45; 48.9% to be precise &#45; to point at which the most recent sub&#45;index reading in May, 2015 stood at only 7.74% higher than the baseline composite level in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; So five months of declines in the sub&#45;index have positively wiped away about three years of price increases in both the Total Index and the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index.
What&#39;s happening?&amp;nbsp; There are 47 commonly used grocery store items within the overall marketbasket, of which 37 items are actually foodstuffs &#45; meat, breads, dairy, produce, staples, etc &#45; and it&#39;s among the foodstuffs that the prices are declining.&amp;nbsp; From April to May of 2015, 14 of the 37 foodstuff items &#45; more than one&#45;third &#45; had declines in prices with the average price decline being 4.97% and the median price decline at 2.55%.&amp;nbsp; There were only five items in the entire basket with price increases; the average price rise of the five items was 10.24% but the median price rise was only 2.6% due to an outlying price increase of 43% for one particular item at one of the three surveyed stores.&amp;nbsp; If this outlier was removed, the average price increase would have been only 2.05%.&amp;nbsp;
What has been notable is the activity within two of the three surveyed &#45; and completely unrelated &#45; grocery stores.&amp;nbsp; One is an independent single supermarket but affiliated with a national supplier that provides the store&#45;brand items for independent supermarkets.&amp;nbsp; That market has, within the past three months, shifted to a new supplier that provides the store&#45;brand items under a different label than before and there have been price drops in multiple surveyed foodstuff items with this supplier&#39;s introduction.&amp;nbsp; The other supermarket is owned by an international chain with stores throughout the Northeastern and Mid&#45;Atlantic regions of the United States and this whole store is now in the process of introducing a more aggressive &quot;Every Day Low Prices&quot; policy with price declines in multiple foodstuff items.&amp;nbsp; The long and short of this is that as incomes continue to erode and increasing numbers of Americans receive governmental food assistance, the grocers are engaging in much more aggressive price competition to survive in a business with very thin profit margins.&amp;nbsp; Each of these two has access to considerable negotiating leverage with wholesale producers and are using it in order to keep sales moving.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ve tried to differentiate between themselves with coffee kiosks and upgraded facilities, but the ongoing economic decline is rendering these moot and it&#39;s now coming down to bare&#45;knuckle pricing to survive.&amp;nbsp; The third store is a regional chain with less negotiating power since it simply doesn&#39;t have the cumulative customer base and it&#39;s this store that first went to price competition over a year ago; it&#39;s this store that&#39;s now unable to keep pace with its two competitors in the survey pricing.
Prices of individual items will rise and fall for a multitude of reasons.&amp;nbsp; Supply and demand, as with meat and dairy.&amp;nbsp; Commodity increases and decreases due to hot money flows, such as with sugar and coffee.&amp;nbsp; Seasonality, such as with eggs.&amp;nbsp; This was why I began to monitor food prices as part of a comprehensive marketbasket in November of 2010; it was to try to look at the notion of inflation/deflation as a whole and in this whole, the recent actions of the grocers are strongly indicative of a broadly deflationary move.&amp;nbsp; The principal reason that the Federal Reserve and government are terrified of deflation, as last experienced in the Great Depression, was that companies were ultimately unable to control their pricing with the collapse in spending.&amp;nbsp; They consequently went bankrupt as their sales disappeared and what we&#39;re now seeing in a localized section of the country is a replay of that scenario as grocers descend to bare&#45;knuckles pricing tactics to maintain sales in an increasingly harsh business environment.&amp;nbsp;
So here are the monthly results for the PracticalDad Price Index.

<title>Discussing Surveillance with the Kids:&nbsp; What If It&#8217;s Not McGee?</title>
<body>My biggest job as a father is to help raise the kids to take their place as moral and productive adults in society, not necessarily a simple job in today&#39;s America.&amp;nbsp; Doing that requires, amongst many other things, an awareness of the issues that face Americans with an emphasis on those that will particularly affect them as they proceed along in life.&amp;nbsp; One of the issues that most concerns me for the kids is that of the presence of government surveillance, particularly the pervasive electronic programs fostered by the NSA.&amp;nbsp;
The issue is troubling for many reasons but there are two points that particularly bother me in regards to the kids.&amp;nbsp; The first is that they are so massively tied in to the ether via the internet and increasingly through the newly termed &quot;Sensornet&quot;, the increasing number of interconnected devices.&amp;nbsp; An entity with the resources &#45; and boy howdy, the NSA has those in terabytes &#45; can carefully craft together an accurate picture of an individual&#39;s beliefs, likes, dislikes and opinions for the highest bidder; in the aspect of a free society, it can also be used to apply pressure to silence an uncomfortable opinion.&amp;nbsp; The second point is that the news&#45;media is largely now controlled by no more than a half&#45;dozen corporate entities and with the rise of corporate fascism within the past two decades or so, there are fewer and fewer places for these youngsters to go for truly independent news.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s impossible to eliminate full bias from any news source, there are now far greater and lucrative reasons to assert control over the news flow and corporations are generally not run by people who are willing to place their companies and paychecks at risk.&amp;nbsp; The rise of the terrorist threat &#45; whether it&#39;s that everpresent or just another straw bogeyman to be conveniently exploited &#45; means that there&#39;s a plethora of opportunities for the media to push a specific message, which is about the need for security and increasing vigilance that begins to conflict with our most core freedoms.
So if it&#39;s my job to prepare the kids and make them aware, I have to look for any opportunity to create a teachable moment.&amp;nbsp; Such was the moment some months ago after we spent a Tuesday evening watching NCIS.&amp;nbsp; It was another of those episodes in which Gibbs&#39; team is against the wall trying to defuse a potential terrorist plot and McGee realizes that he can surreptiously crack some firewalls and obtain crucial data that makes the plot stoppable.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s the nod to legal process with the warning that this could be a problem without warrant, but Gibbs and/or Vance will quietly nod and then make a cryptic remark that is in itself an approval of the measure.&amp;nbsp; My full disclosure is that I like NCIS and have watched it for years, developing an affection for the characters, most particularly the wiseass DiNozzo.&amp;nbsp; But after that episode, I engaged Youngest in a conversation after he&#39;d gone online at the family computer.&amp;nbsp;
The brief talk &#45; and it can&#39;t take huge amounts of time &#45; centered on what the team did to crack the case.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s my problem with it, I said.&amp;nbsp; Did they crack the case?&amp;nbsp; Youngest responded that they had, to which I asked what if that wasn&#39;t McGee at the terminal?&amp;nbsp; What if that was someone else, someone that you didn&#39;t necessarily know and trust?&amp;nbsp; Would that make what they did the right thing to do? Youngest &#45; now in seventh grade &#45; has had enough conversations to understand the notion of legal process and could see that the process had been upended in the interest of public safety.&amp;nbsp; But my subsequent conversation with him went to the need for the process in the first place.&amp;nbsp; I pointed out the recent issues with the IRS, specifically in regards to using it as a political tool against libertarians and conservatives, as well as the Obama Administration&#39;s vicious war against whistleblowers, who often were moral people who were trying to shed light on abuses within the system and not incompetents or malcontents.&amp;nbsp; It might seem heady stuff for a middle&#45;schooler, but the reality is that the kids are generally capable of understanding topics if you&#39;ve raised them to &quot;play up&quot; in conversations and have tried to make them as understandable and matter&#45;of&#45;fact as possible.&amp;nbsp; There have been times with my own kids when they&#39;ve asked questions on the spur and I&#39;ve told them that I&#39;ll come back to them after having a chance to think about it.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t know the facts or have an opinion on it, but that I need a little time to think through how to present an answer that&#39;s understandable for the age level; that said, there have been a few instances where I&#39;ve gone back to fact&#45;check myself so I don&#39;t come off sounding like a moron (not a hard thing to do sometimes).&amp;nbsp; One or two days later, I&#39;ve come back with Remember that question you had about...?
The point to the conversation was to at least give Youngest a glimpse into the issue of government surveillance, that there was more there than just a friendly fictional scout&#45;leading character on a popular television show who could be upending the process.&amp;nbsp; It was also to give him a sense that the legal processes are there for solid reasons and that the technology can be a double&#45;edged sword, to protect the common person from the vagaries and senses of the poltical operatives and hacks that populate the upper levels of the various bureaucracies, willing and able to abuse the system for the ends of themselves or the hands that feed them.&amp;nbsp;
There have been other situations that have arisen since then that have led to further conversations on the question of privacy and surveillance and both my wife and I have pointed them out to one or more of the kids as they&#39;ve been around.&amp;nbsp; The point is to make yourself aware of the issues in our society and whenever possible, find a way to present them to the kids so that they have a grounding as they grow.&amp;nbsp; These are the years that will allow them to begin developing the habits that protect them when they&#39;re finally adults and my expectation is that America is going to have a moment of truth about how far the security apparatus should go in the pursuit of security.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - April 2015</title>
<body>The April 2015 PracticalDad Price Index was completed and compiled in the first days of April and the results show that &#45; for now, at least &#45; the collapse in the marketbasket prices from December 2014 through March 2015 have stabilized, increasing slightly from March.&amp;nbsp; April&#39;s Total Index for the 47 item PracticalDad Marketbasket stabilized at 108.21 (November 2010 = 100), up from March 2015&#39;s Total Index reading of 107.89.&amp;nbsp; The 37 foodstuff items that comprise the Food&#45;Only Index in April stood at 110.20 (November 2010 = 100), up slightly from March&#39;s reading of 109.50.&amp;nbsp; Note that especially regarding the 37 foodstuff items (for a complete list, see here), the drop over the four months from December 2014 through March 2015 accounted for fully 37% of the index rise over the previous four year period since the Index&#39;s inception in November 2010.
What arrested the decline was the increase in the seven item Meats category, as four of the items rose at an average clip of 9.5% from the previous month.&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly, a pound of 80% ground beef remained stable at $4.32 while chicken, deli ham and hot dogs rose significantly.&amp;nbsp; When you remove these four increases, there was an equal number of price increases and decreases (6 each) amongst the remainder of the marketbasket items.&amp;nbsp; Given that the meat category is highly affected by the effects of supply issues, especially PED and the drought, a cursory removal of those supply issues would indicate that the remainder of the 47 item basket indicates that deflation continues to prevail in the economy.
Since deflation is precisely what the Federal Reserve is working to stop, it&#39;s helpful to look at what the monthly pricing excursions and results are showing.&amp;nbsp; Understand that what scares businesses and the Federal Reserve so much about deflation is that it erodes and destroys a business&#39; ability to maintain and control its own pricing structure; money flows from the economy, leaving people with less and the consequent result is that businesses must continually cut their own prices to maintain sales.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s take a look at the workings of the monthly pricing to gauge this.&amp;nbsp; I price at three separate and unrelated grocery stores:  one owned by an international grocery corporation, another owned by a regional American chain and finally, a fully independent grocer.&amp;nbsp; Because one of the original tenets of the index is that the cost&#45;conscious buyer will purchase store&#45;brands whenever possible, a significant portion of the marketbasket is composed of store&#45;brand items.&amp;nbsp; As money continues to flow out of the Main Street economy and the middle class is winnowed away, sales volume declines and prices decrease in order to maintain sales.&amp;nbsp; The news that for the first time, restaurant sales were larger than grocery sales nationally means that there is now additional pressure on grocers; forty years ago, they competed with one another and starting maybe a decade ago, they had to begin competing with Walmart as well.&amp;nbsp; Now they have to compete with restaurants as the younger generation shifts its spending back to inexpensive dining out instead of cooking.&amp;nbsp; Given that more and more of the Millenials are now having to live at home with the parents &#45; a largely unwelcome event &#45; they are gathering together to eat out instead of sitting in the old family kitchen spending even more time with the &#39;rents.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that while there are certainly situations which lead to price increases, such as the diminished supply of the national cattle herds, the composite activity indicates that overall, deflation is occurring.&amp;nbsp; Amongst the three sampled stores, the most substantial price decreases occur in the internationally owned store, followed by the independent grocer and then the regional chain bringing up the rear.&amp;nbsp; What does this suggest?&amp;nbsp; As with Walmart, the international chain is able to order and purchase in significant enough quantities that it can force producers to accept lower revenues.&amp;nbsp; Although the independent grocer is a small one&#45;store operation, it is also affiliated with a national generic brand that supplies an untold number of independent stores across the country with a substantial purchasing power.&amp;nbsp; Because the regional chain simply doesn&#39;t have enough stores, it is unable to command such and the result is that the store&#39;s marketbasket prices are generally higher each month.&amp;nbsp; I can also attest from anecdotal evidence and observation &#45; buttressed by a periodic review of the financial media, that this regional firm is suffering from greater financial difficulties than its two competitors.&amp;nbsp;
As a commenter from Calculated Risk once noted about deflation several years ago:  In the early days of the Depression, a candy bar cost a nickel.  By 1931, you could get three candy bars for a dime and by 1933, nobody had a dime.&amp;nbsp; So money is flowing away from the real economy as we speak and while some prices increase due to true demand and supply, prices are dropping on a composite basis.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll have to see how long this can continue.

<title>The House That Barney Built</title>
<body>If you&#39;re a father, pay attention (obviously) to what you hear and find a meaningful tagline that you can come back to again and again with the kids in order to make a point.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a recurrent phrase or short sentence that makes a point, a rhetorical bumper sticker that you can &#45; with sufficient repetition &#45; hopefully tack onto the kid&#39;s mental bumper for further use as he or she goes through life.&amp;nbsp; Such a phrase that I&#39;ve adopted for the past eight years is The house that Barney built.
The phrase is meaningless for anybody else out there and even for two of my own kids, but it&#39;s a phrase that has significant meaning for Middle, who first heard it while in fourth grade and then shared it with me one evening after he heard it.&amp;nbsp; Middle is an arts person, an individual who finds greater meaning in e.e. cummings than in how to perform algebra.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s now en route to his freshman year in college to pursue a degree in the performing arts and our response, after a deep breath, is to encourage him and support him in this pursuit.&amp;nbsp; That said, it was clear years ago that he&#39;d follow this kind of path and I subsequently made it a point to discuss the practical and monetary side of that kind of life to help clarify what issues and life he might encounter.&amp;nbsp;
The phrase The house that Barney built was something said to him in his first stage production.&amp;nbsp; After years of requests, we acquiesced in his fourth grade year to let him audition for a professional stage production of Oliver! and to our pleasure, he made the cast.&amp;nbsp; The role of Fagin was played by a professional actor named Barry Pearl, and he was &#45; from everything we heard from Middle and others &#45; a wonderful person with whom to work; he also portrayed a great Fagin.&amp;nbsp; But through the various evening practices, he&#39;d find time to chat with the other cast members and impart some professional knowledge to the youngsters, many of whom were enthralled with the notion of performing on stage.&amp;nbsp; As Middle related to me later that evening on the way home from rehearsal, Pearl had engaged in a conversation on the practical aspects of acting, most especially the handling of money.&amp;nbsp; Earlier in his career, he&#39;d been cast as a regular on Barney as Professor Tinkerputt and it gave him a steady income for a period of years.&amp;nbsp; It was during this stint that he took the money that he&#39;d made and put it to paying for a house, a place that he&#39;d be able to reside without having to worry about constantly having to handle a mortgage with what can be a problematic cashflow between acting gigs.&amp;nbsp; He described it to the group as the house that Barney built and it was a phrase that struck Middle enough that he related it to me verbatim that evening.&amp;nbsp; Since I&#39;m always on the lookout for taglines that support the lessons that I&#39;m trying to teach &#45; and there are certain taglines for each &#45; this was a wonderful turn of phrase that I immediately put away for future reference.
The phrase is a wonderfully curt response to the want/need confusion that&#39;s been perfected through the past four or so decades by the Madison Avenue apostles.&amp;nbsp; Our children &#45; hell, sometimes even us &#45; have fallen to the notion that you can indeed have it all and that the want is sometimes as important as the need.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t necessarily have the assets available to get what you want, you can always borrow a bit more to get it and that way lies the path to debt servitude.&amp;nbsp; After all, the financial press noted some years ago in a moment of drink&#45;the&#45;kool&#45;aid idiocy that credit is the new liquidity.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that&#39;s akin to ignoring your own tap when you want a drink of water and instead spending your own money to purchase that water.&amp;nbsp; No, wait...never mind.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s how far along on the crazy train we&#39;ve now come, something unrecognizable to our great&#45;grandparents&#39; generation.
It&#39;s a phrase that isn&#39;t used often, but has been trotted out through the ensuing years as we&#39;ve talked.&amp;nbsp; It was the other Saturday morning that it finally made it&#39;s way out again as he and I sat in the living room with cups of coffee and talked money.&amp;nbsp; Recently, it seems as if that&#39;s sometimes all I discuss and it&#39;s unfortunate that it appears that way.&amp;nbsp; But my point in the discussion was that he was entering a profession that while it could be immensely fulfilling, it could also be financially insecure.&amp;nbsp; I believe that the present system &#45; monetary and political &#45; is insupportable and that the change will certainly occur in the next number of years.&amp;nbsp; I also believe that while the word change comes across on a page as a sterile, unexciting event, the reality will be far more fearful and problematic and that belief colors what I want the kids to learn; after all, my job is ultimately to prepare them to make their way in the world as productive and moral adults and that&#39;s not necessarily what the general system seems to want to teach the kids.
Decide what the most important lessons that you want your children to learn.&amp;nbsp; Spend time in conversation with them as much as possible when they&#39;re younger because once they begin to plug into the matrix, your window for discussion with them will narrow considerably.&amp;nbsp; Decide on your tagline, that rhetorical bumper&#45;sticker that you return to again and again and if it&#39;s from somebody or somewhere else that has an impact on them, then don&#39;t worry about ownership but grab it and stuff in your bag&#45;of&#45;tricks for reference.&amp;nbsp; Because someday, that might be all that you need to say in a pinch to get a point across.</body>

<title>The Saint Paddy&#8217;s Pub Crawl (How Much Should a Father Reveal?)</title>
<body>There are opportunities for conversation and discussion at all corners, and the other morning was a prime example of such.&amp;nbsp; Middle had to attend a theatre audition at an urban university and we took the opportunity to take the train since, if he does attend there, it will be the standard mode of travel.&amp;nbsp; It was during the 70 minute trip that we encountered college students en route to Philadelphia for an early start to their long&#45;awaited Saint Patrick&#39;s Day Pub Crawl and their entry raised the parental question, how much do I reveal about my own youth?
The first indication of the Crawl was the entry of a half dozen people, a mixture of college and post&#45;college adults.&amp;nbsp; One of them carried a bag and they sat quietly and in a moment, a young man picked up his backpack and entered the vacant restroom.&amp;nbsp; A moment later, the Kelly Green Power Ranger, replete with helmet, exited and returned to his seat amidst laughter from both his friends and other passengers.&amp;nbsp; We noted that there then appeared green cans of beer to be quietly passed around amongst the crew.&amp;nbsp; These were followed at the next station by another group of young adults, obviously in college.&amp;nbsp; The students, primarily young women, were carrying convenience store coffee cups but it was the *clink* of a canvas bag carried by one of them that clued us to the fact that the cups had long since been emptied of coffee, if they&#39;d ever carried coffee in the first place.&amp;nbsp; The girls/women  weren&#39;t unduly loud but the next indication of the general condition came when the conductor stopped at the seats just ahead of us and asked the occupants for their tickets.&amp;nbsp; One of the two seated ahead asked, giggling, Is this the Polar Express? &amp;nbsp; The middle&#45;aged conductor&#39;s deadpan response was Would you like me to punch &quot;believe&quot; in your ticket? as he punched away.&amp;nbsp; A moment later, I glanced over at Middle as we chatted and elbowed him, nodding for him to also glance over to see the two women across the aisle refilling their cups with Miller and Landshark respectively.&amp;nbsp; At least one of them had a discriminating taste, although it wasn&#39;t likely to mean squat in another six hours.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to college was my sotto voce remark in Middle&#39;s ear.
The two of us chuckled and quietly chatted as the topic turned to drinking.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no doubt that there&#39;s going to be a serious amount of alcohol available, even more than is already available to high school students today, and all that I can do as a father is to find a consistent message and stay on it.&amp;nbsp; My message has been that you&#39;re simply going to be in situations in which it&#39;s available and I hope &#45; and expect &#45; that you&#39;ll remember that there are consequences to poor decisions.&amp;nbsp; This was followed by two addendum:&amp;nbsp; the first addendum being that if he ever needed a bad guy upon which to place responsibility or blame with his friends, he should feel free to use my name as liberally as necessary.&amp;nbsp; The second addendum was that if he ever found himself in any situation, don&#39;t be afraid to pick up the phone and call me immediately, and that included his friends as well.&amp;nbsp; Middle is aware that many universities are taking a hard line towards alcohol and imposing penalties towards students who are found drinking and/or drunk in the dorms and this reminder was again passed along as well.&amp;nbsp; One of his older buddies commented that he didn&#39;t even make it through the first night on campus his freshman year before the campus police entered his dorm room and arrested the roommate for underaged drinking.
But it was in the next moment that Middle popped the question, Did you ever get drunk in college? and it&#39;s a moment for which every father should be prepared as the kids grow.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fortunate that I could honestly say No, buzzed several times but never out&#45;and&#45;out drunk.&amp;nbsp; I saw others drunk and hated the notion that if drunk, I was passing my judgment and responsibility for my own safety to others, who even if they weren&#39;t drunk, might not necessarily be my friends and interested in my safety as much as their own entertainment.&amp;nbsp; Four years at a university known even then for hard&#45;drinking and I&#39;d been privy to enough debauchery to detest being at another&#39;s mercy and whim.&amp;nbsp; As dangerous as that can be, it&#39;s made worse decades later by the presence of smartphone cameras and social media, used to spread and memorialize the drunk&#39;s embarrassment.
Drinking and drug usage are just later variants of the question, which is liable to cross your child&#39;s lips even in preschool.&amp;nbsp; So decide early on, how much are you willing to share?&amp;nbsp; Do you prefer to downplay and distract them, if they&#39;re young enough, with other topics (and that is certainly a possibility)?&amp;nbsp; Do you choose to acknowledge misbehaviors &#45; and we all have them &#45; in a general sense or do you explore them when they&#39;re old enough?&amp;nbsp; Do you simply not respond and let the kids wonder?&amp;nbsp; This last was my own father&#39;s approach and the company line was that he was always on the straight and narrow.&amp;nbsp; It was when I reached my own college years that he began to share stories from his own youth and I was flummoxed to find that there were periods when he couldn&#39;t have followed the straight and narrow with a yardstick and a magnifying glass.&amp;nbsp; Christ, compared to this guy, I&#39;m a friggin&#39; saint...where did I go right and how much fun did I miss? &amp;nbsp; When I asked him why he never revealed anything until I was in college, he grinned sheepishly and commented something to the effect that if I&#39;d done some of his (mis)deeds, he probably would have killed me.&amp;nbsp; His job as a father, he said, was to be an example.
 And he was correct, the disingenuous bastard.
One friend is also an older father and has been very open with his own kids about his early years, which were far hairier than my own.&amp;nbsp; But they also understand the ways in which things can go wrong by dint of Dad&#39;s mistakes and he is secure enough to dissect his own situations with them, giving them a heads&#45;up on their peers who don&#39;t have the parental sharing.&amp;nbsp; The technology base might change, but the youthful errors remain the same.&amp;nbsp;
So take some time to think about how much of your own past you choose to share with the kids?&amp;nbsp; Do you handle it as a novelist, ascribing some of your own experiences to a fictitious buddy that the kids can never meet because he&#45;was&#45;such&#45;a&#45;great&#45;guy&#45;it&#39;s&#45;a&#45;damned&#45;shame&#45;that&#45;he&#39;s&#45;dead and use the experiences to teach and entertain?&amp;nbsp; Do you take my friend&#39;s route and share the stories openly, using them as examples of how things can go wrong and what not to do?&amp;nbsp; Or do you take my father&#39;s route and go silent, talking to them but trusting that nothing stupid is going to happen?&amp;nbsp; The questions will come and begin after the kids begin talking, so the sooner that you have your approach, the better off you&#39;re going to be.&amp;nbsp; Because the kids can sniff out hypocrisy like a hound looking for his favorite bone.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - March 2015:&nbsp; Cliff-Diving in the Supermarket</title>
<body>The pricing for the March 2015 version of the 47 item PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket was completed and the results were frankly surprising.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index of 47 items declined by 1.33 points to March&#39;s level of 108.09 (November 2010 = 100) while the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index of the 37 Foodstuff items dropped by 2.19 points (November 2010 = 100) to 109.89 from February.&amp;nbsp; This is the largest single monthly decline in the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index since the inception of the project in November 2010 and is a 34% decline in that category since it&#39;s peak at 115.13 only four months previously.
So where has this cratering occurred in the past four months?&amp;nbsp; Despite the understanding that there had been issues in the supply chain for dairy products and meats due to drought&#45;related effects, these are apparently passing as the Meat and Dairy categories declined from the December 2014 peak by 7.43% and 7.41% respectively with most the change occurring during January and February.&amp;nbsp; Most of the declines occurred during those two months as the category changes showed much smaller declines in the one month period of February through March.&amp;nbsp; The four item Household Products category (bath soap, aluminum foil, kitchen trash bags and paper towels) declined by 7.15% since the December 2014 peak with the majority of the decline taking place in the one month period of February through March 2015.&amp;nbsp;In the case of the Meat category, much of the change occurred as grocers found new suppliers for ham and chicken, driving the prices down since the peak by 24.3% and 14.3% respectively.&amp;nbsp; Eggs also declined by 17.5% over the four month period.&amp;nbsp; In the Dairy category, a gallon of 2% milk dropped by 14.9% and butter by 21.5% over the same four month period, although the changes were dispersed across all of the grocers instead of localized to one or another grocer as new suppliers were found.
So here are the Indices results for the past six months.

<title>Conversations with the Kids:&nbsp; Corporations and Privacy</title>
<body>Serendipity reigns supreme.&amp;nbsp; Last week was the rather sudden purchase of a new, larger screen LED television to replace our smaller and older model and after bouncing back and forth among retailers, we purchased a Samsung that honestly does have a breathtaking picture; it&#39;s impressive enough that the family pulled out the director&#39;s cut of Lord of the Rings:  Return of the King over the weekend to watch it again for the umpteenth time.&amp;nbsp; Yet several days after it&#39;s purchase, I came across a Techcrunch article that took a different look at the new Samsung Smart TV.
The Techcrunch writer noted that someone with the Electronic Frontier Foundation actually took the time to read Samsung&#39;s privacy policy for the new voice&#45;command Smart Television and found the following passage within it:&amp;nbsp; In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.&amp;nbsp; Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.&amp;nbsp;So the upshot is that if you program your television to use the voice commands, you&#39;ll have to remember that what you&#39;re saying is going to a third party; you&#39;ll also have to censor yourself lest truly personal information &#45; and as families will spend time in front of the television, truly personal information can be discussed &#45; make it to an unknown third party entity, who will at the very least, add it to the mass of information already out there for data mining.
The article&#39;s contents have already been discussed with the kids and my wife, who is likewise glad that we opted out of voice recognition.&amp;nbsp; The message to Middle and Youngest is that the loss of privacy now extends beyond the internet itself.&amp;nbsp; As society opts for the ease&#45;of&#45;use with a wider and wider range of inter&#45;connected devices, aka the sensornet, it should expect that the insidious price for the ease factor is the ongoing and increasing loss of privacy as more and more personal information is mined and gathered to add to the data profile for each individual.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an especially troublesome consideration for a generation that has grown up online, willing to share an amazing amount of personal information with a wide variety of people on an extended number of social network platforms.&amp;nbsp; So the kids had better become aware now, even if they don&#39;t yet appreciate the potential for trouble that such an invasion of privacy could create.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Deflation Winning in February 2015</title>
<body>The Federal Reserve&#39;s accommodative monetary policies of the past several years have been intended to spur a mild deflation in the hopes that it kick&#45;starts underlying real economic activity.&amp;nbsp; It has also led to an ongoing debate about whether we&#39;re going to see real inflation or the dreaded &#45; at least to the central banks &#45; deflation instead.&amp;nbsp; On the street level, it&#39;s hard to see exactly what&#39;s going on as fees increase and the price of a gallon of gas rolls around at a 20 cent clip over the course of a single week.&amp;nbsp; So since November 2010, I&#39;ve tracked the cost of a 47 item grocery marketbasket at three separate grocery stores that might be purchased by a theoretical family.&amp;nbsp; On the street level, deflation is winning out and in February 2015 delivered a quality body slam to the inflationary expectations crowd as the Total Index of the 47 items dropped from January&#39;s 111.32 (November 2010 = 100) to February&#39;s 109.42.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index of 37 foodstuff items within the basket and that component saw a similar drop of 1.92 points (January&#39;s 114 to February&#39;s 112.08) over the same period.&amp;nbsp; This is akin to cliff&#45;diving when you consider that the 37 item Sub&#45;Index was at an all&#45;time high of 115.13 in December 2014, only two months ago.&amp;nbsp; So over a two month period, the Sub&#45;Index has dropped by more than 3 full points.
So where is the activity happening?
First, there was a bit of a head fake in January when one of the grocery stores saw a price spike of more than a third in their store&#45;brand eight&#45;roll packs of paper towels, which contributed to the Total Index rise that month.&amp;nbsp; However, this same store saw a newer, slightly different store&#45;brand eight&#45;roll package in February at a price akin to the first price while the original eight&#45;roll package was still available at the higher price.&amp;nbsp; Since my standing rule over five years has been, when such occurs, to go with the lesser cost item as the majority of cost&#45;conscious consumers on a budget would, I opted to now use this lesser&#45;priced item in lieu of the more expensive option.&amp;nbsp; My suspicion is that this lesser priced package is of lesser quality and an example of stealth deflation.
From a foodstuff basis, there have been significant price declines in the cost of certain basic foods.&amp;nbsp; Since December 2014, the price of a gallon of 2% milk has dropped from $4.22 to $3.74 (11.4%) and the price of a dozen large eggs has also dropped from $2.62 to $1.99 (24%).&amp;nbsp; The price of a pound of sliced cooked deli ham also declined from $6.16 to $5.99 over the two month period.&amp;nbsp; I was expecting to see a more significant drop in the price of commodity related items such as sugar, canola oil (which is also used for biofuel and linked in price movement to that of oil), coffee and aluminum foil but that didn&#39;t pan out as only coffee saw a minor price decrease over that period.
So what is the upshot?&amp;nbsp; From my perspective in the grocery aisles, deflation and falling prices are generally taking hold.&amp;nbsp; There might be actual increases due to legitimate supply and demand issues such as the western US drought, but the inflationary policy is losing out,&amp;nbsp; Bigtime.</body>

<title>The Messages From the Super Bowl</title>
<body>Just like the tens of millions of other American households, we had friends over last night to watch the game.&amp;nbsp; And like millions of other households whose teams were not in the contest, we were watching as much for the commercials as for the actual game.&amp;nbsp; Dinner?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; Snacks?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; Done and in front of the television by game time?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; The event over the years has almost become as much about watching the creativity of Madison Avenue ad firms as about running backs and linebackers and we were anticipating the latest from Doritos, Budweiser and GoDaddy.&amp;nbsp; But by the end of the first half, I was taken aback by the commercials because the tone of the ads wasn&#39;t remotely close to the care&#45;free beer, babes and goofiness of ads from previous years.&amp;nbsp; What gives?
It was a discordance from previous years that was noticed by others in the household, although I don&#39;t know that they&#39;d take a shot at figuring out why.&amp;nbsp; For the record, I believe that television commercials &#45; and shows &#45; are a great indicator of the national consciousness although I do wonder whether there&#39;s a chicken/egg question here; do the shows and commercials initially set the tone and direct the consciousness or are they merely channeling what is permeating the nation&#39;s consciousness?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m certain that some shows do try to direct but I don&#39;t know whether they&#39;re the small minority and the rest just channel and they&#39;re jumping on the bandwagon.&amp;nbsp; The science fiction movies of the 1950s certainly played out our national fear about the effects of radiation and nuclear testing (Them, for example).&amp;nbsp; The movies of the early 1970s to the 1980s usually showed a distaste and opposition to the military as the country worked through the after&#45;effects of the draining Vietnamese War.&amp;nbsp; Many television shows of the 1980s and onwards worked through dual issues of divorce and feminism by often &#45; as in most of the time &#45; portraying fathers as buffoons and well&#45;intentioned idiots.&amp;nbsp;  A bit broad perhaps, but the evidence is there.
But the commercials&#39; tone was vastly different last night.&amp;nbsp; I actually made notes as to topics and there were three separate commercials that played upon the important role that fathers play in the lives of their children.&amp;nbsp; More men do the laundry and cook than before, but the role is more amorphous than the typical mother&#39;s role.&amp;nbsp; The most notable was the car commercial in which a boy &#45; a la the Oscar&#45;nominated Boyhood &#45; is shown at points in his life without his father, who is apparently a well&#45;known race car driver.&amp;nbsp; Mom is ever&#45;present but it&#39;s obvious that by the time that he&#39;s a teen, he&#39;s withdrawn from her and the relationship is problematic.&amp;nbsp; But Dad re&#45;enters the picture at the end as he picks up the teen and somehow, magically, the two reconnect in a front&#45;seat hug.&amp;nbsp; Would that it were that easy, but the point is obvious that when your attention is not upon the family but upon yourself, there&#39;s a steep price to be paid.&amp;nbsp; These aren&#39;t about mothers who are presumed to be present and engaged, but about fathers &#45; us &#45; with the message that we matter.&amp;nbsp; Even the Budweiser lost dog commercial is clearly carrying a message that it&#39;s necessary to look after the little ones, who are likely to suffer if we aren&#39;t present and in the game.&amp;nbsp; The most glaring example was the suicide&#45;inducing Nationwide commercial about a kid who will never enjoy a prom or other activities because he died in a childhood accident.&amp;nbsp; It was a message so out of keeping with past Super Bowl ads that both and my eldest son and I immediately and vociferously remarked on it.&amp;nbsp; Whoa!&amp;nbsp; Did you see that?!&amp;nbsp; Holy shit!&amp;nbsp; Way to kill the buzz, Nationwide!
The other message of note pertained to overcoming obstacles.&amp;nbsp; There were two, from different corporations, that each featured real&#45;life people overcoming the loss of legs and obviously on the national consciousness for all of the veterans who have lost limbs in the past fourteen years.&amp;nbsp; These people weren&#39;t veterans &#45; one was a female athlete and the other a small boy &#45; but each was capable of overcoming such an obvious loss and taking on an active and vibrant life.&amp;nbsp; Another ad dealt with helping teenage girls overcome the self&#45;image issues that plague them with the onset of puberty.&amp;nbsp; Each child or person was asked to run like a girl, throw a ball or punch like a girl and the result was predictably sexist.&amp;nbsp; These shots are then compared with the results when young girls are themselves asked and the results are not sexist in the least as the girls run, punch and throw an imaginary ball without any hint of obvious effeminacy.&amp;nbsp; The point of these ads is that what matters is what you think and not others so go ahead and don&#39;t be discouraged.
The most notable difference however was in the GoDaddy commercial.&amp;nbsp; Previous years all played out around beautiful, sexy women and displayed a glitz and raciness that left people talking afterwards for days.&amp;nbsp; But the sole GoDaddy ad quietly showed a man working patiently at his desk with the surrounding windows portraying nighttime.&amp;nbsp; No wild music, no women and just the narrator stating that for all of the hard work that you, the small business owner, is putting in to get ahead, we&#39;ll lift a dip&#45;filled chip in salute to you.&amp;nbsp; The advertisers are obviously aware that in the present state of zombified&#45;economy America, there are more businesses closing than opening and with much of their own business dependent upon domain registration and website management, it&#39;s crucial that their clients buckle down and grind it out.
Whether Madison Avenue is the chicken that&#39;s just passing along the gist of the national consciousness or it&#39;s the egg that&#39;s cluing in a mass audience that all really isn&#39;t well, the message is there and clear.&amp;nbsp; Buckle down and get ready for the grind.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s going to be difficult with many obstacles, but it&#39;s certainly not unconquerable.&amp;nbsp; And above all, look to your family &#45; especially you men &#45; and understand that despite what&#39;s been televised for the past quarter&#45;century or so, you have an important role in raising your children and preparing them for the world.&amp;nbsp; The gravity found in these commercials on what is typically such a light&#45;hearted broadcast indicates that the consciousness is aware that exceedingly difficult times are ahead and is now formulating it for the mass consumption to the widest audience possible.&amp;nbsp; Get ready and gather the kids in.&amp;nbsp; Something wicked this way comes.</body>

<title>The Dollar&#8217;s Flaw as the Global Reserve Currency</title>
<body>Middle is now immersed in AP Economics, learning about variable and marginal cost curves and utility, yet still without any notion of something as basic as the definition of money.&amp;nbsp; This is a follow&#45;up to a previous article that I wrote for him &#45; So, Just What is Money? &#45; because I find it problematic to learn about details without a general understanding of larger, more basic topics within the subject.&amp;nbsp; So, Middle, once again grab a soda and your earbuds and make yourself comfortable for another lesson.
There&#39;s a solid argument to be made, amidst the ongoing currency wars, that the American Dollar could soon lose it&#39;s status as the Global Reserve Currency despite its present big kid on the block status when compared with the rest of the world&#39;s currencies.&amp;nbsp; I frankly believe that it will happen and sooner than later.&amp;nbsp; Yet while there are many rationales and explanations for why this might occur, I think that the true reason rests at the economically molecular level of the definition of money.&amp;nbsp; Yes, many in the world want to see the dollar fall as a poke&#45;in&#45;the&#45;eye to the arrogant Americans and God knows there are others who cannot reconcile a Global Reserve Currency with a huge debtload.&amp;nbsp; But the core reason is that we no longer manage our currency, the dollar, with the same emphasis as the remainder of the world must manage their own currencies and the world will somehow &#45; messily &#45; create a system that better aligns its needs.
Understand that there are three operative characteristics for anything that is agreed upon to serve as money.&amp;nbsp; First, it must be fungible such that any one unit of currency can be used in place of any other unit of that currency; in other words, a crisp new Benjamin from the bank can be as readily accepted as a Benjamin that you pull from your wallet.&amp;nbsp; Second, money is a medium of exchange which serves to simply make the daily transaction of business all that much easier.&amp;nbsp; My wallet is far less bulky with three Benjamins than it might be with the assortment of chickens and rabbits that might be required to purchase a like amount of goods were the Benjamins not available.&amp;nbsp; Finally, money should be reliably relied upon to serve as a store of value; it should be expected to purchase the same amount of goods and services in the future as it does today.&amp;nbsp; With a few exceptions in the world, most nations have a currency that serves as money because each sufficiently meets the three criteria that the population accepts it.&amp;nbsp; When there is a sufficiently large breakdown in a currency, such as in Zimbabwe, then the population creates and sustains a black market in some other material that serves in lieu of the local currency.
And it&#39;s here, within these three characteristics, that the flaw lies.&amp;nbsp; Since the end of the Second World War, the American economy has been predicated upon consumption as an economic driver and all efforts have gone to build and sustain that consumption.&amp;nbsp; The supposition is that as people spend their money on goods and services, that money flows throughout the economy and provides demand for other goods and services in a sort of virtuous economic circle.&amp;nbsp; It was during the Great Depression of the 1930s that the American government adopted Keynesian theory in the hopes of providing demand by running governmental deficits, using public debt as fuel for a stricken economy until it could recover enough to not require the debt&#45;fuel.&amp;nbsp; That thinking has generally continued since then with debt run&#45;ups shifting back and forth from private to public sector through the decades until there&#39;s presently a huge overhang of total debt.&amp;nbsp; The use of debt to fuel consumption also serves to pump money into the money supply, which is essentially an inflationary practice that not only has a domestic effect but an international effect as well since the dollar is the global reserve currency.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that if business is transacted in dollars and the cost of a good rises as the supply of dollars rises, then any nation wishing to engage in business will see prices rise in its own currency since it would take more to purchase the dollars to satisfy the transaction.&amp;nbsp; The offsetting result to this practice is that while consumption continues and debt builds, such practices are inherently inflationary and slowly, willingly sacrifice the store of value characteristic.
This is apparently fine for our own country but it does create problems for the rest of the world.&amp;nbsp; The American economy since the Second World War has been something that&#39;s outstripped any previous economy in the history of the world.&amp;nbsp; Our citizens have prospered and reached a standard of living that no other society had ever before achieved.&amp;nbsp; Having a currency with the Global Reserve Status allows a privilege and latitude that people with other currencies don&#39;t enjoy if simply by dint that those with the GRC status can literally print as much as they choose while the Norwegians, South Africans, Jordanians and Chinese cannot.&amp;nbsp; These other countries must still contend with the quaint notion that money should serve as a store of value so that their people can continue the finer things in life, such as bread and adequate shelter.&amp;nbsp; They do not have the amount of wealth as the average American &#45; or at least the .1% &#45; and their economic security in the global economy is a bit more tenuous and dependent upon the policy decisions of foreigners than we are as Americans.&amp;nbsp; At least for now.
Writers such as Yves Smith of naked capitalism have explained how economists went to great lengths to quantify economics and make it into a hard&#45;style science such as physics or chemistry.&amp;nbsp; Yet why a nation&#39;s currency is granted the GRC status is essentially unquantifiable, based upon non&#45;economic factors.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s that nation which is not only militarily strong, but also perceived to be solid and relatively prudent, at least until the leadership drinks the kool&#45;aid and sends that nation down the path to Wonderland.&amp;nbsp; The key word is perception and that is simply unquantifiable.&amp;nbsp; But any money must meet the three criteria for common acceptance and there has to be a general agreement amongst all users &#45; domestic and foreign &#45; that there is a semblance of parity between the three.&amp;nbsp; There can be temporary discrepancies but if the semblance of balance isn&#39;t maintained, then pressures grow within the system until such time that the perception breaks and something new comes about to take its place.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the Dollar, the notion that a store of value could be maintained existed so long as the Dollar was essentially backed by gold, that material that everyone across the globe considers as the principal store of value par excellence.&amp;nbsp; But when Richard Nixon took the United States off of the gold standard in 1971, it was then that the notion of perception truly took center stage.&amp;nbsp; It is because we have chosen to so over&#45;emphasize the medium of exchange characteristic, sacrificing the store of value as our leadership purposefully strives for inflation to simultaneously stoke consumption and inflate away our debt, that the rest of the world has altered their perception of our collective wisdom to manage the dollar in a way that is truly mindful of its status as the Global Reserve Currency.&amp;nbsp; There is no way to quantify how this perception has suffered or measure when such a massive change will occur.&amp;nbsp; But the rise of the BRICS and the increasing use of the Remimbi to settle international transactions makes clear that the Dollar&#39;s days are numbered.&amp;nbsp; The problem for the average person is that reading about it is, by nature, sterile and unexciting; real life however, is generally far more exciting and colorful as it plays out in the store aisles and down the street.&amp;nbsp; We have raised our children in a society that demands consumption.&amp;nbsp; We will have to collectively figure out how to raise them in a new society that is far more mindful of value than it has been in generations.</body>

<title>A WTF Proposal on Reducing 529 Tax Benefits</title>
<body>It was an audible what the f*#% that escaped my lips as I read a NY Times article that explained how President Obama was now proposing to eliminate tax&#45;free withdrawals from 529 college savings plans.&amp;nbsp; Under the proposed changes, the money earned from any new contributions to 529 accounts would lose the capital gains tax protections that have made 529 plans a decent tool in the belt for paying for higher education.&amp;nbsp; In addition to the loss of the capital gains tax forgiveness &#45; if the money is used for qualified educational expenses &#45; the money earned via the accounts investments would actually be taxed at the much higher ordinary income rate.&amp;nbsp; Incredibly enough, the proposal is part of a much broader package that a White House official described as designed to consolidate a variety of educational tax breaks and also funnel more money to middle&#45;class families.
Let&#39;s take a few minutes to actually parse through the proposed changes since this strikes me as a measure with multiple intents.&amp;nbsp; First, I have no doubt that this is tied to the floated proposal to fund free community college for eligible students..&amp;nbsp; While the tuition proposal is the carrot however, this measure would be the stick to help herd even more young people into the community college track.&amp;nbsp; We already know that the disparity between the stagnant income and the wildly inflative tuition rates has led to a shifting of family income levels downwards through the college system.&amp;nbsp; What I mean by this is that as tuition rates have risen far faster than family incomes, what a family could afford for their children has shifted downwards from private non&#45;profit institutions (Yale or Pacific Lutheran for example) to state supported institutions (any of the SUNY institutions or your local state college).&amp;nbsp; So while a solidly middle class family could get the kids through a Pacific Lutheran in 1980, the same family would be hard&#45;pressed to do so in 2015 and would be more likely to have the kid attending the local state college or university instead.&amp;nbsp; Even if the states are, as a group, funding less on a per student basis than in the past decades, state schools are still more affordable and the 529 plans are a legitimate tool in saving for that alternative.&amp;nbsp; Remove the 529 plans as an effective savings instrument and even the public institutions become more unaffordable; the result is that if the youngsters are going to be educated, then one of the few alternatives is to utilize the community college for an associate degree or if a bachelor&#39;s degree is sought, the first two years of general education requirements.
Second, make no mistake that there&#39;s an almost punitive intent in this proposal.&amp;nbsp; It would be one thing to make the 529 less attractive by simply removing the preferred tax status of capital gains forgiveness and there are more than a few people who would probably look at the 529 and say meh, moving on to other alternatives.&amp;nbsp; But this proposal moves far beyond that:  this actually turns standard taxation and accounting measures on their heads by taking what monies have been made from a capital gain status &#45; which is precisely what they are &#45; and wholesale shifting them to an income status with a concomitant increase in taxes.&amp;nbsp; The authors of this proposal are doing the old west equivalent of dumping dead animals in the water hole to poison it for anyone else.
Third, there is signifcant debate over what income level is, in the eyes of the authors, the middle class.&amp;nbsp; The class card is played by the notion that the 529 plans &quot;primarily provide a subsidy to people who would save in other forms anyway&quot;, according to Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it does provide extra bang for the proverbial buck over other investment vehicles.&amp;nbsp; But that tax provision was an intentional public policy message that higher education did matter and this program was an effort to help offset what even then was recognized as an oncoming problem.&amp;nbsp; The notion that the 529 is simply another investment vehicle, akin to the standard mutual fund or whatever, is also not true since anybody who&#39;s investing in the 529 plan understands that use of the funds for any other purposes means that there&#39;s going to be a tax penalty for withdrawal.&amp;nbsp; If this is just another savings vehicle, then just take the money and dump into a consistent money&#45;losing fund that costs you 10% annually.&amp;nbsp; The class argument is also offset by the fact that the average 529 account only has about $19770 and the average regular monthly contribution is $175.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t the kind of investor that&#39;s looking to get subsidized; this is the kind of investor that&#39;s hoping to squirrel away enough money to get the kids through a state institution.&amp;nbsp; The GAO notes that while only a small percentage of families utilize 529 accounts, the median income of those families with 529 accounts is three times that of those without 529 accounts.&amp;nbsp; I believe that would actually be true, apart from the fact that it&#39;s coming from the GAO.&amp;nbsp; The simple fact however, is that it&#39;s common knowledge that higher incomes simply remove the possibility of any grant or need&#45;based scholarship for the student, leaving the costs to be either borne by the family and/or student with savings and debt.
The Obama Administration notes that it has other incentives to more than adequately offset the 529 change.&amp;nbsp; These include making the American Opportunity Tax Credit  permanent, with a maximum credit of $2500 annually, subject to income requirements.&amp;nbsp; The other notable action put forward by the administration is that the tax bill on any student forgiven (yes, they&#39;ll forgive the debt but you have to pay taxes as though it was an income) would be eliminated.&amp;nbsp; The reality there is that unless you are engaged in a program that eliminates student debt in return for service of some kind, it&#39;s damned hard to get the student debt forgiven.&amp;nbsp; The onus is upon the borrower and the person has to demonstrably show that it is indeed a hardship for self and family; that is a steep hill to climb and few are able to do so.
The families utilizing the 529 plans are the ones who are looking ahead to the future and making an effort to save for it.&amp;nbsp; Eliminating the benefits of the 529 is as much a penalty for savers as are the other policies of the government, most especially the ridiculous rates on various savings accounts.&amp;nbsp; The message from the power structure is that we aren&#39;t to worry, that there will be other options and if nothing else, we can always just borrow more when the time comes...precisely the last thing that savers and responsible parents want to hear.
There is also another aspect to this entire matter that bothers me, but it&#39;s something that I frankly have to work through before I put it out there.&amp;nbsp; Suffice it to say, there will something more on this when I&#39;m comfortable that I&#39;ve thought it through.</body>

<title>So, Just What is Money?</title>
<body>It&#39;s been clear that we&#39;re involved globally in currency wars and the recent decision by the Swiss National Bank to cut its peg to the Euro is one more skirmish.&amp;nbsp; Yet at the same time on the family front, Middle is beginning a semester course in AP Economics so there are basic questions about economics to be discussed.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve already written about what interest rates are as well as the definition of inflation with the notion that the kids will read them at some point.&amp;nbsp; But what&#39;s happening globally begs a very, very basic question:  just what is money?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll be forwarding this to Middle for his light evening reading because I believe that the heart of the current global currency wars and economic dislocations centers on a basic disagreement of the operational function of money, particularly between the United States &#45; holder of the global reserve currency &#45; and the Chinese.&amp;nbsp; So, Middle, grab a soda and earbuds and settle down for a little while...
We&#39;re inundated with all manner of informational overload about Personal Finance.&amp;nbsp; We worry about what the kids are learning and how they&#39;ll cope in their future.&amp;nbsp; But for all of the ink, there&#39;s a simple question that&#39;s overlooked:  what exactly is money?&amp;nbsp; What is it about that crumpled five dollar bill that I just pulled out of your jeans before they went into the wash (and it&#39;s now waiting for you on the dresser) or that 1 Euro coin that came back from last summer&#39;s long&#45;awaited trip?&amp;nbsp; They are obviously different in all ways &#45; shape and substance, language, etc. &#45; but each serves an identical purpose for its respective nation(s).&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t make much sense to go into marginal analysis and supply/demand curves or ascertaining the cost of interest if you don&#39;t at least have a handle on that most basic financial tool, money.&amp;nbsp; For all of the differences in currencies across the globe &#45; dollar, euro, krona, yuan, yen &#45; each has three operative characteristics in common that make them able to serve as money.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s important to understand these three characteristics because I believe that the heart of the most basic issues involving the currency wars is because the rest of the world places a greater emphasis upon one characteristic than the US does and the difference has created fundamental problems for the world that can no longer be ignored.
The first characteristic of money is that it is fungible.&amp;nbsp; One unit of money within a particular issuing region is precisely interchangeable with any other unit of that money.&amp;nbsp; In other words, that crumpled five dollar bill on your dresser could be taken to the soda cave at the nearby convenience store and used to purchase a bottle of Stewart&#39;s Orange Cream Soda as well as the five dollar bill that I pulled from my wallet to give you for that same bottle of soda, assuming of course that I was willing to do that.&amp;nbsp; You could borrow a five dollar bill from your buddy for the soda and that would serve as well as the crisp new fiver that you got from the bank.&amp;nbsp; The point is that they are interchangeable for use &#45; fungible &#45; and the store clerk is legally required to take any fiver presented to pay for the soda.&amp;nbsp; The sole reasons for not taking the note would be that it was either somehow damaged beyond repair &#45; sorry, but half of a note is unusable &#45; or there&#39;s reason to believe that it&#39;s counterfeit.&amp;nbsp; This same premise holds true across the globe in any reasonably functioning nation in which the citizenry actually has a semblance of trust in its currency; any ten pound note could be used to purchase chips in an English pub and any renmimbi note could be used to purchase cigarettes in a Chinese market.&amp;nbsp; If the people of a particular country want to take some other currency instead of their own for daily life &#45; think Zimbabwe or Argentina for instance &#45; then they have much deeper issues both economically and politically since the two go together like crap and stink.
The second characteristic of money is that it serves as a medium of exchange for any transactions that occur in an economy.&amp;nbsp; It that sense, money is a kind of tool that makes life easier.&amp;nbsp; The classic example would be in a simple farm and trade economy in which everybody has to barter what they have &#45; chicken eggs for instance &#45; for something else that they need.&amp;nbsp; If Farmer A has eggs but needs a plow fixed and the blacksmith doesn&#39;t need eggs but would rather have sheep wool, then Farmer A has to figure out exactly who both needs his eggs and has sheep wool; if no one else readily comes to mind, then the potential range of transactions becomes larger:&amp;nbsp;  A trades his eggs to C for five bushels of excess grain and A in turn gives four of those bushels to F for the wool; A can then give the wool to the blacksmith for the plow repair and keep the grain as profit.&amp;nbsp; Over the course of centuries of this barter economy, people began to use various forms of money to make their lives easier and eliminate the need to navigate a massive web in order to get the plow repaired.&amp;nbsp; The biggest hurdle to overcoming barter and moving to money was the rise of a common belief that that form of currency would be good so that all parties could buy into that system and participate.&amp;nbsp; This was frequently based upon the belief that the political power was stable to enforce the laws and back that currency.&amp;nbsp; If you want a more up&#45;to&#45;date example of currency and the forms that it could take, think back to the night that we watched Stalag 17 on Turner Classic Movies.&amp;nbsp; William Holden played Sergeant JJ Sefton, a cynical anti&#45;hero who was the resident scrounger and procurer of all good things within the German prison camp.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a scene in the first half in which he has his minion &#45; because we all need our minions &#45; inventory the contents of his usually locked footlocker.&amp;nbsp; He is loaded with cigarettes but also has a lesser quantity of chocolate bars, silk hosiery, men&#39;s cologne and even a camera.&amp;nbsp; In the closed society of the Stalag, the American dollar is worthless for everyday transactions because it is simply not accepted as a medium of exchange and God knows that the Germans wouldn&#39;t be giving the prisoners Deutschemarks.&amp;nbsp; But the cigarette is the commonly accepted medium of exchange for transactions between the prisoners and even the guards since the Germans produced lousy cigarettes and even they acknowledged that.&amp;nbsp; The cigarette is ideal because in that time and place, everybody smokes and accepts them; there is also a constant, but rationed supply coming into the Stalag via the Red Cross parcels that the prisoners periodically receive.&amp;nbsp; So if you want to bribe a guard or transact some business with another prisoner, the cigarette is the ideal form of money and the lesser quantity items would serve as the higher denominated forms of money.&amp;nbsp; A Red Cross parcel might contain two packs of 20 cigarettes each but only two chocolate bars, so in the purely theoretical world of currency exchange, a chocolate bar would be worth a pack of cigarettes and if it wasn&#39;t, then that would be due to purely local conditions.&amp;nbsp; The point is that everybody accepted them because all believed that American cigarettes were superior and that they were typically available.
Which leads to the third operative characteristic of money, a store of value.&amp;nbsp; People will use something as a form of money if it can reliably be found to hold it&#39;s value, particularly measured by an ability to purchase the same amount of something over time.&amp;nbsp; If that form can&#39;t maintain it&#39;s value, then the people will engage in economic behaviors to account for that until another form of money is found to replace it.&amp;nbsp; What might those behaviors be?&amp;nbsp; One might be to simply spend it as soon as possible instead of even bothering to save &#45; the grasshopper side of Aesop&#39;s Ant and the Grasshopper &#45; because there&#39;s no point to keeping it.&amp;nbsp; The person might also find something else to purchase that she believes will hold value better than the current form of money and in this regard, so&#45;called hard assets such as gold, silver or even diamonds are prime examples.&amp;nbsp; No, you can&#39;t buy a Stewart&#39;s Orange Cream Soda with a gram of silver but you&#39;ll purchase the silver and simply set it aside and hold it as a form of savings since it can hold value.&amp;nbsp; When there&#39;s a reason to purchase the Stewart&#39;s, then you simply sell the silver and use the actual money as the medium of exchange with the clerk.&amp;nbsp; For the record, I can see absolutely no reason to sell silver in order to purchase Stewart&#39;s and if there is, you have more important items to purchase for survival than Stewart&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; Think back to the example we used from the movie Stalag 17.&amp;nbsp; The cigarettes are also a valid form of money because they do hold their value well.&amp;nbsp; There is a general equilibrium of value between the supply of cigarettes (periodic supply via the Red Cross parcels) and the demand for cigarettes since they are all smoked.&amp;nbsp; The conditions are set as well for their use since there&#39;s really nothing else of commonly&#45;accepted value amongst the general population that could change.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, the war might end as victorious Allied armies overrun the camps which means that the prisoners are released to the larger society in which they use dollars, and cigarettes become much more plentiful and hence less valuable.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, the Allied Air Forces under the command of General Bernanke might decide to provide a mass cigarette drop on all known German Stalags as a morale boosting effort.&amp;nbsp; That would certainly make the prisoners happy, but it would utterly ruin Sefton&#39;s meticulously constructed business.
So what&#39;s the takeaway from this lesson?&amp;nbsp; That whatever serves as a viable form of money in an society must meet three basic criteria and that there should be a general balance between the three.&amp;nbsp; There can certainly be stresses to a currency dependent upon any number of factors whether they are social, economic or political, internal or external.&amp;nbsp; But to appreciate what&#39;s going on around you, you have to get your nose off of the screen and begin to pay attention, especially over the course of time; you have to start thinking beyond the now and try to view something as dynamic and within the context of a much longer timespan.&amp;nbsp; And finally, look for any number of ways to place what you&#39;re seeing within the context of the greater world.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t live in a vacuum and what occurs nationally or globally can have a significant local presence right in front of you.</body>

<title>Another Look at the American Middle Class</title>
<body>There&#39;s been a persistent drumbeat of commentary over the past eight years &#45; since the onset of the Financial Crisis of 2007 &#45; that pertains to the demise of the American Middle Class.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the start of a period that I refer to myself as The Great Reversion.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s framed within the context of a declining median family income as well as declining number of assets, backdropped against what is now the largest gap in wealth distribution since the Roaring Twenties, prior to the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; But to consider the American Middle Class in such a light is too shallow, both in terms of what it is happening as well as how it came about.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s happening to the American Middle Class is not just an economic event.&amp;nbsp; To say that the American Middle Class will suddenly make a magical comeback with a</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index -January 2015</title>
<body>The New Year came and went and immediately afterwards, I did the routine for determining the activity of the PracticalDad Price Index of 47 items.&amp;nbsp; This composite marketbasket of 37 foodstuffs and 10 non&#45;foodstuffs is done at the first of each month at three unrelated grocery stores in the area and has been occurring monthly since it&#39;s inception in November 2010 (November 2010 = 100).
After a signficant jump in the 37 item Food&#45;Only Subindex from November 2014&#39;s 113.87 to December&#39;s 115.13 (November 2010 = 100), the January 2015 Food&#45;Only Subindex dropped back to 114.00.&amp;nbsp; The Full Basket Index of 47 items (see here) actually rose slightly from December&#39;s 111.18 to January&#39;s 111.32 based upon price increases in non&#45;food items such as soap, diapers and paper towels.
The December increase was led by a rise in the cost of a dozen large eggs, reflecting foreign demand for American supply due to Avian Influenza and I surmised then that the price would decrease again, and this occurred as the average price of a dozen eggs dropped by 19%; this was still higher than the November price before the December spike.&amp;nbsp; Dairy products also showed an improvement as Milk (1 gallon 2%) and butter (1 lb quarters) each dropped by 8.8% and 10.7% respectively.&amp;nbsp; Looking at the 37 foodstuffs in all, there were eight items with a price increase versus seven items that decreased in price, although the average price decrease was 6.58% versus an average price rise of 2.17%.
The price increases in soap and diapers were extremely small but the index was affected most by a price increase at one store &#45; and yes, there&#39;s the downfall to a small sampling size &#45; of paper towels by 52%.&amp;nbsp; Because this store was part of a chain, I checked at another of the same chain&#39;s stores in the area and the price for that item was consistent elsewhere so this change was not an individual store&#39;s error.&amp;nbsp; This massive increase was not seen by the other two stores as one of those stores actually had a small decrease in the cost of their paper towels (eight rolls double ply package).&amp;nbsp; What I do know is that across the past several years, this particular store with the major price increase has become a sort of canary in the coal mine for me with price changes occurring here first and then reflected elsewhere at a later time.&amp;nbsp; So we&#39;ll just have to see as the next several months go on as to whether this change is meaningful or just some isolated anomaly.</body>

<title>Some Thoughts on Free Community College</title>
<body>I was sitting with my Better Half when there was an online article about President Obama&#39;s recently announced plan for free community college tuition.&amp;nbsp; As we read the article and then followed up with other sites, the commentary flowed.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, it can be trolled as yet another spending program with dubious results but there are some other aspects to consider.
Our conversation was framed by a discussion earlier at dinner with one of Middle&#39;s friends, who is presently a college junior at a state university.&amp;nbsp; As he explained his course load, he commented that the very first Gen Ed class that he took on Day One was a math course, which started with the concept of counting.&amp;nbsp; Both of us looked at him and my wife stopped and asked for clarification and he confirmed that it started with simple counting before moving on to more complex topics such as addition.&amp;nbsp; This was on top of stories from others of his contemporaries, which led us to the conclusion that much of the early college course load is simply remedial and if this is indeed the case, then there is actually some value in the President&#39;s proposal.
But before that, what is the core of the proposal?&amp;nbsp;When you read the brief articles &#45; and yes, the devil is in the details &#45; there are requirements of all parties involved for this to work.&amp;nbsp; First, the students &#45; those who are eligible and I smell income requirements in the air &#45; are required to maintain a GPA of 2.5 and must be in school for at least half&#45;time.&amp;nbsp; They must also show continuing progress towards their program goal, whatever that may be.&amp;nbsp; For their own part, the community colleges will have to offer programs that are either fully transferrable to a local four&#45;year public university or occupational training programs for which there is high demand (and oh yeah, actual job opportunities).&amp;nbsp; The government part of the deal is that the Federal Government will put up three&#45;quarters of the money and the states will put up the other quarter of the funding; in the ideal theoretical world, the student would be able to save $3800 in tuition each year.
Now let&#39;s pick this apart as we did on the sofa.&amp;nbsp; The reality facing America is that our students, as a whole, are performing poorly versus their peers across the globe.&amp;nbsp; Our students are behind in science and math, critical in today&#39;s technological society.&amp;nbsp; But look at the cost differential of the same type of course taught at both the community college and local state university.&amp;nbsp; A basic three credit Math 100 course at my local community college (and I&#39;ve verified the numbers via the respective tuition website pages) would cost a student $458 while a basic three credit Math 100 course at the local state university would cost $792, a differential of $334.&amp;nbsp; Since these basic courses would be generally identical in scope, it makes no sense on a societal level to duplicate the courses with some students paying the higher amount and effectively wasting the resources.&amp;nbsp; This is clearly an effort to bring about some relief to the issue of student debt, which now is in excess of $1.2 Trillion, more than the amount of outstanding credit card debt.&amp;nbsp; It is also a concrete effort to combat the several decade mantra that the college route is the route to take after high school; it&#39;s a mantra that has now sucked in enough people to swell the rolls of student debt holders to more than 40 million  young adults.&amp;nbsp; The inclusion of the word local is also meaningful to students.&amp;nbsp; Part of the message sold over the past several decades is loosely reminiscent of Bluto Blutarsky&#39;s infamous line from the movie Animal House:  ...the best seven years of my life.&amp;nbsp; The community college proposal is squarely saying that a quality higher education doesn&#39;t have to include the now&#45;expected time away from home.&amp;nbsp; I understand that there are plenty of young people who crave that &#45; God knows that I did &#45; but that was a different time with a different set of circumstances.&amp;nbsp; With the job market being what it is in terms of wages, would you rather live away from home now and take on debt or clear your decks now and then proceed with your life?
There are other points to make here.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a message to community colleges that they need to take greater care in offering programs that are indeed timely and of value.&amp;nbsp; As costs drive more away from any higher education, the message is that the money will be there for students if there are programs that make sense; so cull away the nonsense and put together curricula that meets society&#39;s demands.&amp;nbsp; It also sends a message that there has to be a greater effort by both the community colleges and four year institutions to mesh what&#39;s offered so that money isn&#39;t wasted on credits that won&#39;t transfer to the four year university.&amp;nbsp; There have been several instances in which I&#39;ve been told by someone that their kid or neighbor&#39;s kid won&#39;t have credits transferred, meaning that the resources are wasted.&amp;nbsp; Multiply this across &#45; at least &#45; several hundred thousand students and that&#39;s considerable money simply down the tubes.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s likewise a message to the four year institutions that perhaps there are other options to the public and that in a period of declining resources, they&#39;re best served putting the money into that which truly does train, educate and enlighten.
Since I began this article two days ago, other information about the proposed cost has been issued by the administration, assuming that you actually believe them.&amp;nbsp; According to the Press Secretary, the President&#39;s program would cost about $60 Billion over the course of a decade...so call it roughly $6 Billion annually.&amp;nbsp; The knives will come out and it&#39;s going to be decried as budget&#45;busting, although the concept that an outlay of $6 Billion &#45; nah, since we&#39;re all of going on $20 Trillion in debt, let&#39;s use the lower case and call it billions &#45; is actually laughable in the greater scheme of things.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s actually the argument that this type of spending would actually be an investment.&amp;nbsp; According to the Federal Education Budget Project, produced by the New America Foundation, the collective student default rate for federal student loans as of 2011 was approximately 18%.&amp;nbsp; Yes, this is 2011 data but let&#39;s apply this default rate to the 2014 student loans issued in the amount of almost $100 billion; this is a default of approximately $18 billion.&amp;nbsp; The same article from FEBP shows that the net recovery of defaulted money is approximately 80% for a net loss of $3.6 billion.&amp;nbsp; The net differential on the $6 billion average annual outlay is a loss of $2.4 billion.&amp;nbsp; The important thing is that as the system begins to change over time, the defaults should lessen and the money begin to flow to where it&#39;s most effective.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t even address the psychic and emotional toll on young adults who are stuck with a debt albatross around their neck as they start out in their adult life, nor does it address the delayed creation of households, which is actually important for the national economic health.
There&#39;s one other point from both our conversation and a review of the information.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a collective failure when the colleges &#45; community and four&#45;year &#45; are forced to offer such utterly ridiculous course offerings as taken by Middle&#39;s friend.&amp;nbsp; This information is certainly offered by at the secondary &#45; hell, even the primary &#45; level and it&#39;s a complete failure that the information isn&#39;t being collectively learned.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s on us.</body>

<title>Embracing the Suck</title>
<body>The term embracing the suck was popularized some years ago as a military term, the modern equivalent to the WW2 GI terms FUBAR or SNAFU.&amp;nbsp; The gist of the expression is that there are times when regardless of what you try to do, you&#39;re going to be stuck with something so you might as well make the best of it.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a term that&#39;s come into use in the PracticalDad household and particularly in regard to Youngest, who is now in middle school &#45; Dear God, when did that happen? &#45; and finding it as I did during that time, a purgatory to be endured until able to move on to someplace better.&amp;nbsp; The issue surrounds interpersonal stuff with kids, especially the use of nicknames.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s an issue that I know all too well, having spent years &#45; from late elementary school through high school &#45; with the moniker &quot;Weird&quot; attached to my last name.&amp;nbsp; It came quickly enough in elementary school when Bill Cosby premiered his Fat Albert show on Saturday mornings and the kids in my class latched onto it since the character&#39;s first name is literally the same as my last name.&amp;nbsp; But the name stuck for more than a short period and suddenly, I found it downright painful at times.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know that I was any more weird than any other boy of that age, at the cusp of puberty and entering a phase that truly can be odd on any number of levels.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of my own opinion, the name stuck.
In Youngest&#39;s case, his is a nickname that comes not out of behavior or appearance but instead, circumstance.&amp;nbsp; Youngest is an active kid who is in some ways a throwback with his neighborhood buddies, a group of boys who  have routinely gathered at different yards after school to play sandlot football and generally beat the crap out of one another.&amp;nbsp; But through the unorganized activities and the various sports, he&#39;s incurred a string of significant injuries over a span of time that have, in each instance, wiped out months of any strenuous physical activity.&amp;nbsp; The most recent injury has had a permanent effect since he&#39;s now forbidden to play organized football in school, a sport for which he&#39;d campaigned for several years and one which his mother and I had finally relented, agreeing to give permission to play.&amp;nbsp; With all of the facts now coming out about traumatic brain injuries and the recurrence rate among athletes who have already incurred such an injury, the risk is simply too great.&amp;nbsp; With yet another freak accident this Autumn, his fate and nickname were sealed and even kids at school who don&#39;t know his real name, recognize him by the nickname.
Youngest would come home and in discussing the day, he&#39;d express frustration at the ongoing situation.&amp;nbsp; Not only was there too much drama among the collective hormonal melting pot, but now there was this damned nickname.&amp;nbsp; As the conversations continued, he learned that there are really only three options when dealing with the interpersonal crap from others.&amp;nbsp; The first is to simply try ignoring it in the hopes that it either becomes boring for others or someone else is gifted with an even worse moniker to steal the verbal limelight.&amp;nbsp; The second is to make an issue of it with others and deal with it head&#45;on, and typically in an aggressive and occasionally violent way.&amp;nbsp; The third is to simply embrace it, taking it on and trying to make peace with its existence.&amp;nbsp; The first option of trying to ignore it is, for a kid, largely unrealistic.&amp;nbsp; Kids have little patience and sense of time and it would probably take much longer to die away than they&#39;re willing to wait.&amp;nbsp; I discussed my own experience with him and freely acknowledge that my own situation eventually went on for years...so look how well that one turned out for me, son.&amp;nbsp; The second, aggressive, option is generally unworkable since there&#39;s always &#45; and at any age &#45; some ass who&#39;s more than happy to twist the knife and watch the ensuing fireworks.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that by going off, you&#39;re surrendering control of the circumstances and wind up dancing to another&#39;s tune.&amp;nbsp; The last option is to simply try to find a way to make peace with the situation and even work it to your advantage, i.e. embrace the suck.&amp;nbsp; This option is the one that I adopted in my own youth after some conversation with my own parents.&amp;nbsp; The opinion that I took was that if I was going to be called weird, then I might as well give people something to talk about and hey, maybe even have some fun in the process.&amp;nbsp; So yes, I wound up doing some things that I might not have were it not for the nickname but the truth is also that I had a bit more fun that I would have had otherwise.
Youngest realizes that of all the possible nicknames in the world, his isn&#39;t even remotely the worst possible one; this is especially after learning from his grandfather that one of that man&#39;s childhood friends was nicknamed booger, a moniker still attached even after six decades.&amp;nbsp; Youngest has also decided to embrace the situation and one of his Christmas gifts was something that he can wear to school that pokes fun at his own situation.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something that he asked for specifically after seeing it advertised and it now awaits the proper moment for an appearance in school.&amp;nbsp; I have to admire his willingness to go ahead with it and understand it completely since purposefully trotting it out in front of others takes their power away by showing that you can&#39;t be affected by their own remarks, comments often made with the intent to belittle and cut.&amp;nbsp; I have no idea when he&#39;ll pull out the item and it&#39;s possible that it will wait until the weather is not so bitterly cold.&amp;nbsp; But it will come out and Youngest will embrace the suck, a lesson in character that will last him, like others, a lifetime.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - December 2014:&nbsp; Egging on Inflation</title>
<body>The December 2014 data for the PracticalDad Price Index was collected and tabulated and while the Total Index of the 47 item marketbasket was static from November&#39;s 111.15 to 111.18 (November 2010 = 100), the 37 item Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;Index rose to a new high of 115.13 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; This surpasses the previous Sub&#45;Index high of 114.73 reached in September 2014.
Of the 47 items in the marketbasket &#45; 37 foodstuff and 10 non&#45;foodstuff &#45; there were actually more items that decreased in price than increased, 10 decreases to 7 increases with the remainder unchanged.&amp;nbsp; But these were smaller decreases that were offset by a major increase of approximately 37% in the retail price of a dozen large eggs; the average November 1 price of a dozen large eggs was  $1.89 to December&#39;s $2.62 per dozen.&amp;nbsp; Why the rise?&amp;nbsp; First, the data from the past four years of the PracticalDad Index demonstrates a Fall/Winter spike in egg prices that subsequently drops back and it&#39;s likely that this is another example of those same spikes.&amp;nbsp; Second however, the wholesale price of eggs across the country rose signficantly in the past several months because of increased foreign demand for American eggs.&amp;nbsp; Just as there&#39;s been increased foreign demand for American dairy products because the New Zealand dairy suppliers are also affected by a drought that impacts their own production, Mexico has seen a major decrease in production because of the forced destruction of poultry flocks affected by an outbreak of Avian Influenza.&amp;nbsp; This poultry virus is highly contagious and the only real measure to combat it is to destroy any flock &#45; healthy birds included &#45; in which it&#39;s been detected.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the possibility that this can mutate and be passed on to humans that keeps epidemiologists awake at night.&amp;nbsp; Any significant  outbreak will accordingly affect supply and Mexico has consequently met its egg demand by importing more from the US.
Will eggs again drop in price in future months?&amp;nbsp; I suspect so, but not to previous levels as before.
There is one other curious observation from the past several months of price surveillance.&amp;nbsp; In two of the three supermarkets &#45; each of which is wholly unrelated to the others &#45; I&#39;ve been seeing empty sections on the shelves.&amp;nbsp; These spaces aren&#39;t just because the product hasn&#39;t yet been restocked, but on several occasions there have been small signs stating that the items are discontinued.&amp;nbsp; When I return a different time, that shelf space is filled with another item.&amp;nbsp; I haven&#39;t collected any data but am working purely on observation.&amp;nbsp; It does however, make me wonder whether all of the dislocation that we&#39;re seeing in this slow motion real&#45;economy train wreck is starting to have an effect on the supply chain and if so, to what extent it will spread.
And now for the past six months of results.</body>

<title>Cancelling Christmas?&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m Down With That&#8230;</title>
<body>Now that the first third of the major painting project is finished &#45; and that&#39;s fodder for another article on practical economics and kids &#45; it&#39;s time to get back to writing and what should appear but mild uproar over a parental decision to &quot;cancel&quot; Christmas.&amp;nbsp; Is this going too far?
Let&#39;s set the stage here.&amp;nbsp; The parents live in the western US and have three sons ranging from five to eleven years of age.&amp;nbsp; Upset at the ongoing disrespect and ingratitude for a period of months, the two reached a point at which they pulled the plug on Christmas, at least the material Santa&#45;aspect of it.&amp;nbsp; There will still be a tree and the kids will be allowed to receive their gifts from their grandparents and other family members, but the usual Santa&#45;aspect fol&#45;de&#45;rol will be gone this year.&amp;nbsp; In its stead will be activities that foster what should be a greater appreciation for the season &#45; adopting less&#45;fortunate families, adopting elderly neighbors as &quot;grandparents&quot; and inviting them to meals and sending care packages to a weather&#45;devastated village.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t simply refusing to even acknowledge the season, but a purposeful refocusing on the meaning of the season to teach a lesson in gratitude and respect for others.
But is it going too far?&amp;nbsp; From my standpoint as a parent of three kids, it&#39;s frankly not too far at all and given the ages of the boys, probably not a moment too soon.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re going to discipline your children, you need to start at a very early age so that you aren&#39;t forced to fight battles with recalcitrant and hormonally addled teens, some of whom might actually be bigger than you are.
First, understand that raising kids to be appreciative, respectful and grateful is difficult in present American society.&amp;nbsp; The consumerism runs amok and with the plethora of kid&#45;centric programming &#45; Nick Jr., Nick, Cartoon Network, etc. &#45; there&#39;s an ongoing push to have whatever is coming down the pike.&amp;nbsp; This can be coupled with programming that also shows frankly disrespectful behavior to parents and other elders and yes, it is corrosive.&amp;nbsp; At an evening meal this past Thanksgiving break, Eldest and Middle &#45; now in college and high school respectively &#45; rode Youngest for getting Cartoon Network&#39;s Fairly Oddparents banned from the household eight years ago when he responded to me with a character&#39;s phrase, blah blah blah.&amp;nbsp; Even if the family controls the household electronic media, the kids will likely be spending time in school with more than a few peers in which the programming and media isn&#39;t controlled; the upshot is that the kids will still be exposed and influenced via their classmates.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re raising our kids to take their place in the world and the unfortunate reality is that the attitudes and behaviors of other kids will bleed over into our own households and will require ongoing monitoring and conversation.
Second, the mother states in a paragraph that there seems to be a fair number of parents who aren&#39;t enforcing discipline upon their kids.&amp;nbsp; There are parents who will threaten consequences that on one hand seem thoroughly unenforceable, such as the several parents that I&#39;ve overheard at airports threaten their misbehaving children with leaving them behind instead of taking them along to Florida.&amp;nbsp; Really?&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re not going to take them along?&amp;nbsp; At some point, the smarter kid realizes that there&#39;s no way this is going to happen and the parent loses stature in the kid&#39;s eyes and the belief is born that what&#39;s coming from the &#39;rents mouths really is blah blah blah.&amp;nbsp; If discipline is going to be effective, it has to first be enforceable; you can&#39;t in the spur of the moment make a threat that can actually be met.&amp;nbsp;Kid, if you don&#39;t pull yourself together and stop that behavior now, when we get to Florida, you&#39;ll be sitting on the beach towel for the first half hour instead of going in the water.&amp;nbsp; The next part of the deal is to actually enforce the discipline, however unpleasant that might be in the moment.&amp;nbsp; In the case of traveling to Florida, it&#39;s actually best if you already have a track record of enforcing the discipline so that the child complies in the public airport instead of melting down into a massive tantrum.&amp;nbsp; So if you promise
in the household to remove a bedroom door for three days should certain misbehavior continue, then you had better follow through when that moment occurs again.&amp;nbsp; When the child realizes that you are actually serious and willing to follow through, then good behavior will generally occur later without the need for public histrionics.
The third point is that our economy is changing before our eyes.&amp;nbsp; In the past several years, the typical family has seen falling income and declining assets, coupled with the need to take on greater responsibility for medical bills and health insurance than before.&amp;nbsp; This is the kiss of death for the consumption model with which we ourselves were raised, when benefits were routinely provided by employers and Grandpa had a pension that provided at least a semblance of some security in his old age.&amp;nbsp; Our own kids need to start seeing a change in the Christmas behaviors and practices so that they can themselves adapt and work within the economic constraints within which they are likely to find themselves.
So yeah, I&#39;m good with the notion of cancelling Christmas if the parents think that that&#39;s what is necessary to restore some order in the household.&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not just a simple ban but is being reinforced with more positive behavior that models the better aspects of the season and yes, it is something that the boys will remember, especially when Mom and Dad are telling them something when they&#39;re man&#45;children instead of boys.&amp;nbsp; If my own wife and I haven&#39;t had to cancel Christmas, it&#39;s only because we&#39;ve already removed bedroom doors and cleaned out bedrooms of all toys for a week at a shot so that the kids understand that we&#39;re serious when we say something.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - November 2014:&nbsp; Hot Dog(s)!</title>
<body>I&#39;ll keep this brief since I&#39;m now sandwiched and involved in a home project which promises to morph into something much larger.&amp;nbsp; The November 2014 PracticalDad Price Index was completed and the results show that the Total Index for the 47 item marketbasket rose slightly to 111.15 (November 2010 = 100) from October&#39;s 111.11.&amp;nbsp; Despite the fact that beef and dairy prices have been rising significantly in the past several months because of the impact of the drought in the western US, the Food&#45;Only Index for the 37 foodstuff items in the basket actually dropped from October&#39;s 114.45 (November 2010 = 100) to November&#39;s 113.87, a drop of more than a half point (.58 to be specific).
There&#39;s no doubt that the meat and dairy prices will continue to increase, although those prices were static over the course of the month.&amp;nbsp; The drop however, occurred because of a significant price decline in the price of one store&#39;s package of hot dogs.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fascinating to watch since this particular grocer actually engaged in stealth inflation with their hot dog packaging, decreasing the size of the package from 16 to 15 ounces during the summer; their price for hot dogs was substantially higher than their competitors so they decreased the package size to make it more competitive.&amp;nbsp; But within a four month period, they managed to drop the price by 28% and I can only assume that it was because they managed to find a producer capable of offering much lower cost dogs, which is essentially stealth deflation as prices are controlled not by altering the physical package size but rather, the quality of the input foods.&amp;nbsp; So one grocer has managed to engage in both stealth inflation and stealth deflation within a five month period.</body>

<title>Yes, Dairy and Meat Prices Are Increasing</title>
<body>The New York Post headline announced that prices were rising for many food staple items, particularly meat, fruit, milk and butter.
This was the same message that I got when I recently went shopping with my better half.&amp;nbsp; We had come up the refrigerated dairy aisle and stopped alongside about four other people as everyone gazed at the rows of shredded and block cheese products that were all on sale at prices that, roughly two years ago, were full prices.&amp;nbsp; One person stood with her hand on her chin and commented to her neighbor about the prices and my better half likewise asked, what&#39;s going on with cheese?&amp;nbsp; My response was that it was simply due to the mega&#45;drought that&#39;s presently parching the western US.
Prices are going up for all of these items and as much as I truly dislike the Federal Reserve, it&#39;s actually a supply and demand issue instead of a monetary policy issue.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that the western United States &#45; and especially California &#45; is now locked into a horrendous drought, which some scientists state is the type that occurs only about once in a hundred years or so.&amp;nbsp; Satellite images of the San Joaquin valley show the tremendous difference to that valley in the course of only year; what&#39;s especially startling in the January year&#45;over&#45;year photos is the loss of the typical snowpack.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the melting of the snowpack that helps provide water to replenish reservoirs and land and with that diminished, the effect is impressive.&amp;nbsp; It was this kind of megadrought that was thought to be responsible for the gradual destruction of the Anasazi culture that flourished in the pre&#45;European southwestern United States, leaving behind the famous cliff dwellings at Chaco Canyon in present&#45;day Arizona.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t meant to be breathlessly apocalytic, but a drought of this magnitude is going to leave a considerable hurting on how we live in those conditions and in those areas.
The fact is, California and the western US provide a significant percentage of our national food supply.&amp;nbsp; The state&#39;s top five agricultural products are dairy, greenhouse/nursery products, grapes, walnuts and beef livestock and the effect of the drought has already been dramatic;&amp;nbsp; In late 2013, agricultural conglomerate Cargill announced that it was closing yet another beef feedlot  in Texas as the size of the aggregate US cattle herd dropped to levels unseen since the early 1950s.&amp;nbsp; The principal cause of the herd decline is due to drought&#45;related high feed costs for ranchers, who correspondingly culled their herds to bring their margins back into line.&amp;nbsp; Considering that the population of the US has more than doubled from 131 million to 308 million from 1950 to 2010, it&#39;s a given that a significant drop in supply would affect prices.&amp;nbsp; When the USDA reports that the typical American consumes 7 more pounds of beef today than in the 1950s, then clearly the demand is up as well and with that, prices.&amp;nbsp; California provides the same for dairy as it is the number one state for production of milk and dairy products, accounting for about 20% of domestic US milk production.&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s a given there as well that any impact upon the supply is going to have a corresponding effect upon prices, especially when Americans are likewise prolific milk drinkers.&amp;nbsp; But the other part of the demand issue is that we&#39;re now exporting far more dairy production to other countries, particularly China, than in the past.&amp;nbsp; New Zealand leads the world in dairy exports but is likewise suffering from drought&#45;related supply issues so that their customers are looking elsewhere and that elsewhere is the US.&amp;nbsp; China&#39;s appetite for milk has led to a 39% rise in US dairy exports in the first quarter of 2014 alone and while it&#39;s nominally only about $700 million &#45; how jaded are we when a million of anything doesn&#39;t seem like much? &#45; that&#39;s still a lot of dairy that isn&#39;t making it to our own shelves.
So yes, prices are rising and as the drought continues and we use our own food supplies for export purposes, they&#39;re going to continue doing so.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a simple math problem.&amp;nbsp; Understand that inflation is not a single variable issue but a bubbling stew of multiple ingredients &#45; supply and demand, monetary supply and policy, technological change and political policy amongst others.&amp;nbsp; But when you examine the causes, you have the ability to look at larger issues and the mundane price of those blocks of cheese on that refrigerated aisle shelf take on new meaning.&amp;nbsp; A New Yorker commented to the Post reporter that while prices have gone up, her income has not, as it hasn&#39;t for hundreds of millions of other Americans.&amp;nbsp; If we&#39;re going to permit an unfettered laissez&#45;faire capitalism by producers, then we have to look to the income side of the house and see why our incomes haven&#39;t risen accordingly.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the cause and what can and must be done to bolster that income to sustain a diminishing middle class?&amp;nbsp; Indeed, should we begin adopting policies that protect the food supply for our own citizenry instead of using food as an export entry in the trade balance ledger?&amp;nbsp; Much as I don&#39;t want anyone anywhere to starve, China&#39;s demand for milk is partially predicated upon their own citizens&#39; distrust of their domestic production due to pollution and safety issues, and that is their problem.&amp;nbsp; Not ours.
Prices for those items will continue to rise until such time as either demand decreases or supply increases.&amp;nbsp; Until then, we&#39;ll certainly have to make the necessary micro&#45;level changes such as buying and freezing extra blocks of cheese on sale, shifting to other protein sources to replace beef, and becoming far more purposeful in our meal&#45;planning and shopping.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;ll have to also begin expecting that our leadership &#45; political and business &#45; review and change the policies that benefit the corporations to the detriment of the individual.&amp;nbsp; We can&#39;t repeal the laws of supply and demand...they are as real as gravity.&amp;nbsp; But we can and should expect that leadership won&#39;t engage in monetary and political policies that create conditions that are only exacerbated when supply and demand go south.</body>

<title>Conversations with the Kids:&nbsp; Corporate versus Local</title>
<body>One of the great issues of our day &#45; and one that casts a shadow over our youngsters as they move forward &#45; is that of the power of the corporation versus the power of the individual.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re in a time that&#39;s most akin to the Gilded Age of the late 1800s as the uber&#45;wealthy, the corporations and the financial sector hold outsized control of the levers of power in the nation.&amp;nbsp; The situation has become so outlandish that the Supreme Court has ruled that capping the amount of political contributions is a violation of the right of free speech, including that of corporations which are at their heart, wholly fictitious legal entities created solely to earn a profit for a small group of initial investors.&amp;nbsp; Until there is significant enough unrest to force change, and that was at the heart of the labor conflicts of the late 19th century, this is the world into which my children will enter.&amp;nbsp; So what can and should I do as a father and parent to prepare them for entry into that world?
Short of singing union songs about beating up the scabs in lieu of grace at the dinner table, there are two important things, even if they seem insignificantly small in the moment.&amp;nbsp; The first is to understand that the kids are watching you and taking their cues from you in how they deal with the daily issues of life.&amp;nbsp; Many parents wonder whether the kids are even paying attention as immersed as they are in the electronic ether but I believe that they are paying attention to both your actions and inactions.&amp;nbsp; If I&#39;m going to preach the inequities caused by the rise of the corporations at the expense of the individual, then I&#39;m going to have to be far more purposeful in my own spending and that goes to where I shop.&amp;nbsp; The persistent drumbeat of consumerism &#45; buy more, buy cheap &#45; over decades of advertising does create real cognitive dissonance for someone who&#39;s shopping.&amp;nbsp; The simple reality is that purchasing an American made consumer product is probably going to cost more simply because the labor costs of an adult labor is greater than that of Chinese peasants or Indonesian children.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that there&#39;s going to be less money around for the stupid crap that so many Americans purchase in the hopes of filling whatever emptiness exists in their lives.&amp;nbsp;
The second thing is to constantly look for situations in which you can have conversation with the kids, the proverbial teaching moments.&amp;nbsp; Such instances do crop up and two did so within the last week.&amp;nbsp; In the first case, Eldest called me from college with the news that her car had a flat tire.&amp;nbsp; No big deal since we purchased a AAA membership for her when she took the car to school and she&#39;d already contacted them to arrange service.&amp;nbsp; She also arranged to have it towed to a tire dealer for a new tire, which was fine thus far.&amp;nbsp; But we parted ways when she then told the tire dealer &#45; a Firestone dealer &#45; to have the mechanic look at other issues under her hood, which she couldn&#39;t specify apart from a perceived shimmy and grinding noise.&amp;nbsp; The bill was coming back to me and my immediate response was to tell her to have the dealer contact me directly.&amp;nbsp; When they did so, they had already done some looking under the hood and had a list of things that could be the issue and were of possible concern.&amp;nbsp; Eldest was concerned about the driveability of the car while I was more concerned about a vehicle which, in my opinion, had issued the dealer a fishing license.&amp;nbsp; If the tire hadn&#39;t gone flat, the car wouldn&#39;t have been there in the first place and with so little specificity, I was greatly concerned that the repairs would be unnecessary and financially excessive.&amp;nbsp; In the end, I authorized only the purchase of two new mid&#45;range tires and asked for a list of what they considered possible causes and then directed Eldest to take the car to a reputable local mechanic, one who had serviced the cars of other family in that area for decades.&amp;nbsp; Eldest had the list of suggested repairs in hand when she went to the local mechanic and after a test drive, he solved her issues with a $50 repair that wasn&#39;t even on the dealer&#39;s list.&amp;nbsp; The lesson to Eldest was that the corporate dealers had no loyalty to any individual and were usually only concerned with their own bottom line instead of yours.&amp;nbsp; A good local mechanic however, was intimately aware of the power of referral and good service and was generally in the mindset that customers were also neighbors as well.
The second moment occurred with Youngest, an aspiring drummer.&amp;nbsp; His first drum set is a decent beater set from a thrift store, a reputable brand that has simply seen better days despite it&#39;s continued usefulness.&amp;nbsp; It was good for the first year of practice in which the user typically beats instead of plays the drums but the boy is  moving beyond that.&amp;nbsp; He asked for a floor Tom to supplement the existing pieces and that request led to a visit to a local Guitar Center, a corporate music store that specializes in rock n&#39; roll stuff such as guitars, drums, keyboards and amps.&amp;nbsp; He understood that this was simply an educational visit on top of a small purchase to help repair a high&#45;hat cymbal and listened as I spoke with the employee in the drum section.&amp;nbsp; The employee was clear that while they might be able to get ahold a floor Tom on special order, the usual route to purchasing drums was to buy an entire set in order to get a significant price break and if we wanted, there were any number of good mid&#45;line sets that he could show us.&amp;nbsp; I let Youngest look but demurred on anything apart from the needed piece and the boy left the store with stars in his eyes for a set that cost in excess of $800.&amp;nbsp; But while on the other side of town, I passed a locally owned drum store that services multiple counties and decided to stop in to learn more about floor Toms and buying by the piece instead of the set.&amp;nbsp; The owner is a younger guy who&#39;s decided to be the go&#45;to guy for the region and is far more well stocked for all manner of drums than the corporate Guitar Center.&amp;nbsp; He took me to a room in which there were a significant number of used Toms available, traded in by previous drummers.&amp;nbsp; We spoke for a good quarter hour and the gist of the conversation was that no two drummers were alike and in fact, many preferred to buy by the piece and assemble their own custom set.&amp;nbsp; He challenged the statement that you should only buy by the set and confirmed by belief that there was greater profit &#45; and salesman commission &#45; in selling by the set; it also made it easier for a staff that wouldn&#39;t be as familiar with the merchandise as someone who did this full&#45;time.&amp;nbsp; I have since shared this with Youngest, including the fact that there&#39;s greater commission for a salesman who can sell an entire set at one time, even if it is pricier than the customer might be able or willing to afford.&amp;nbsp; The upshot for each child has been a lesson in practical economics, that you&#39;re liable to get better and more customized service from a local merchant who has skin in the community&#39;s game.
As the middle class is winnowed away, there will be increasing social and political friction until there&#39;s a breaking point.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t profess to know what the final result will be, except for the fact that the resources and opportunities available to our adult children will be less than they are today let alone what they were when we were young.&amp;nbsp; My job until that time is to teach the kids and help them find a way to safely navigate this economy with some integrity.&amp;nbsp; If I can also set the stage for a future more vibrant and diversified local economy that&#39;s able to withstand the corporations, then that&#39;s the added bonus.&amp;nbsp; I will continue to search for the teachable moments as they arise and in this corporate version of America, those moments will repeatedly present themselves.</body>

<title>China (Kind of) Overtakes the US.&nbsp; But Maybe Not For Long.&nbsp; Or Maybe.</title>
<body>I believe in serendipity, the notion that things fall into place unexpectedly; the definition is meant with pleasant connotations but I&#39;ll take it however I find it.&amp;nbsp; Shortly after I posted the October 2014 PracticalDad Price Index results, I came across two separate and seemingly unrelated news articles.
The first article pertained to the announcement that China has finally overtaken the US as the world&#39;s largest economy.&amp;nbsp; It was surprising on the face of it since other sources were all pegging that event to finally occur in 8 to 10 years.&amp;nbsp; But further reading showed that this was a different metric, called purchasing power parity.&amp;nbsp; What this means is that the GDP for each nation is adjusted by an international body for the purchasing power of its currency.&amp;nbsp;Since the given is that the price of most items in the US are comparatively more expensive than in China &#45; from the average price of housing to a Big Mac &#45; then this pricing power should be factored into the national GDP.&amp;nbsp; While it sounds a bit far&#45;fetched, the notion that nations such as Italy and the UK are now calculating the contribution of such illegal activites as hookers and blow to their national GDP, then it really isn&#39;t that much of a stretch at all.&amp;nbsp; This was a new twist that was implemented just within the past several years and is a different result from the traditional GDP metric which, while still showing the US ahead of China. showed a trend that indicated China was on track to overtake the US by the early 2020s.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, there was some conservative talk radio blowback, condemning the Obama Administration and Democratic Congressional policies for permitting this unconscionable event to occur.&amp;nbsp; And this is what sets me to wondering after reflecting on the second article.
The second article is from the NY Post, which alleged in 2013 that the government cooked the books on the unemployment rate prior to the 2012 presidential election.&amp;nbsp; This most recent column alleges that a Denver field office whistleblower has come forward with information that the unemployment numbers are again being cooked.&amp;nbsp; What caught my eye in the article was a comment that it also extended to inflation data.&amp;nbsp; In fairness, the original allegation regarding the pre&#45;election unemployment numbers was investigated by the Commerce Department&#39;s OIG with the resultant finding that there was no substantiation to the claim; but the new allegation does make me wonder...especially in light of the ongoing findings about the weaponization of the IRS against conservative groups.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s difficult to know who to believe in this world of he said, she said journalism, a newspaper with a definitive political leaning or an agency of an increasingly distrusted government.&amp;nbsp; It might be a purely academic spitting contest save for one fact:  the inflation rates are now key to the purchasing power parity metric and if anything ever shifted from purely interesting to important, it would be this particular issue.&amp;nbsp; Since the median American family income is still multiple times greater than the median Chinese family income, the ability to keep the inflation rate low in comparison to the Chinese rate could conceivably have some impact on the GDP competition.
I have an elderly friend of Irish descent and his repeated mantra has been never let the facts get in the way of a good story and it&#39;s certainly possible that we&#39;re now in this operative mode.&amp;nbsp; God knows that there are plenty of other issues that have been, and are, gamed.&amp;nbsp; I won&#39;t sit here and say the numbers are or aren&#39;t gamed since I simply have no way of knowing.&amp;nbsp; But the question is planted and I&#39;ll keep plugging each month with the PracticalDad Price Index.&amp;nbsp; In the long&#45;term, the question of potentially gamed inflation data is a short&#45;term sideshow because the real issue is the passing of the torch of economic dominance from one nation to another.&amp;nbsp; And the truth is that for all of its own problems, China is moving along in such a way as to truly overtake us in a decade or less.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of the question about data quality.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - October 2014</title>
<body>The following brief article was attached in a quick note from my better half, who commented Wonder how this comports with your pricing.&amp;nbsp; The quick piece was a snarky bit from a writer who noted that we should all feel wealthier for the low food inflation as noted by the government&#39;s CPI.&amp;nbsp; As I was several days away from doing the pricing, I thought that it would be worthwhile to compare how the PracticalDad Price Index does actually compare with the monthly results of the CPI?&amp;nbsp; More importantly, what might account for any differences?
First things first, however.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index for the 47 item marketbasket rose slightly from September&#39;s 111.07 to October&#39;s 111.11 (November 2010 = 100.00); the Food&#45;Only Index covering the 37 items within the basket dropped by .28 from September&#39;s 114.73 to October&#39;s 114.45 (November 2010 = 100.00).&amp;nbsp; While butter and hot dogs continued to demonstrate the effect of inflation by rising 11.4 and 6% respectively, these were offset by significant declines in white bread, sugar and rice (15.3, 8.1 and 6.4% respectively).&amp;nbsp; In the case of a 20 ounce loaf of store brand white bread, each of the three grocery stores has now dropped the standard price to $1 or less, whereas the prices for the loaf had been on the order of $1.25 or more in past months.&amp;nbsp; As usually occurs, these declines occurred in different months so that the price impact is muted over a longer period of time.&amp;nbsp; What this does show however, is that the grocers are responding to the decreasing buying power of the typical consumer by finding ways to offer a lower priced basic good; I expect that this is because there is use of lower quality flour or some other ingredient than before (stealth deflation).&amp;nbsp;
So how does the CPI figure issued by the US Government differ from what I&#39;m capturing with the PracticalDad Price Index?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s examine the six months of results, ending with the most recent comparable month of August 2014.&amp;nbsp; Understand that because the CPI is calculated for multiple geographic areas, there&#39;s roughly a two month window difference between the most recent PracticalDad and CPI results.&amp;nbsp; For comparison purposes, I&#39;m looking at the 37 foodstuff items of the PracticalDad basket and comparing that sub&#45;index result with the Food&#45;at&#45;home line from the CPI monthly report; the full Food Index from the BLS CPI report also includes the change in prices for food purchased in restaurants so I&#39;m reviewing against the sub&#45;category for similarity.&amp;nbsp; In the table below, I&#39;m showing the monthly Food&#45;Only Index from the PracticalDad site as well as the monthly change from the previous month (M&#45;o&#45;M) for both the PracticalDad and CPI Indices.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

                    6/14
                    112.65
                    1.11

                     7/14
                     113.22

                      8/14
                      113.71
                      .49
                      .2



&amp;nbsp;
What&#39;s most noticeable about the Month&#45;over&#45;Month results between the two is that the PracticalDad Index has a much greater variability from one month to the next than the CPI.&amp;nbsp; This makes sense given that the PracticalDad Index is calculated at only three stores in a single geographic vicinity while the CPI Food&#45;at&#45;home is priced nationally from multiple geographically disparate markets across the country.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the CPI basket is much larger than the 37 foodstuff items in the PracticalDad basket so that there&#39;s a larger number of sampled items; the larger the sample, the less the variability.&amp;nbsp; For a look at the foodstuffs sampled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, see here, especially down at page 8.&amp;nbsp; Even with this roster from the BLS, it doesn&#39;t list the individual items sampled each month.&amp;nbsp; When I began to sample prices in November 2010, it was a purposeful decision to keep the basket manageable, using the most common items that a family would purchase each month, based upon my own experience as shopper, cook and chief bottle&#45;washer through the years.
The monthly pricing for the PracticalDad Index is done solely by me and even with four years of familiarity, it&#39;s not uncommon to have to return to a store more than once in order to double&#45;check a particular item.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly the case when there&#39;s an incident of stealth inflation and a package size changes.&amp;nbsp; What sometimes makes it difficult is that the change is insidious so that one foodstuff package changes across the stores over a period of months.&amp;nbsp; That said however, the PracticalDad Index has captured instances of stealth inflation in the following products: sugar, orange juice, hot dogs, women&#39;s pads, diapers, store brand tomato sauce, cereal, and coffee.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the BLS, the pricing is done by &quot;economic assistants&quot; hired by the individual metropolitan field offices of the BLS; these individuals are trained in what to look for and then set loose with the results forwarded to the DC office of BLS.&amp;nbsp; The data is then inspected by analysts and any questions are returned to the field if there are issues.&amp;nbsp; The analysts do adjust for any qualitative and quantitative changes, but these changes are never reported in the actual report.&amp;nbsp; So even if the changes are noted in the calculations, they are never individually reported in the monthly results.&amp;nbsp; While I actually believe that BLS process is fundamentally sound, the presence of so many different assistants with so many different products to price can lead to some missed prices.&amp;nbsp;
The fact that the pricing in the PracticalDad Index is limited to a small area means that there can be a greater examination of the inflation versus deflation scenario as well.&amp;nbsp; The index has captured price increases that are attributable to monetary policy, most especially in the pricing of commodity products when hot money flows into, and then out of, that product.&amp;nbsp; Coffee, Canola oil and sugar are prime examples as their prices exploded several years ago with the hot money flows into the commodity markets; these prices have since dropped from previous highs, even accounting for stealth inflation packaging changes in coffee and sugar.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m also able to see the deflationary side as individual stores are having to adjust for the increasing lack of consumer buying power.&amp;nbsp; One store in particular has had to simply cut prices of some basic foodstuffs since their customer base doesn&#39;t have the funding.&amp;nbsp; The practice has shifted to the other stores in multiple cases as well.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, it&#39;s this micro&#45;scale that helps explain some of the distrust of the CPI figures by the general public.&amp;nbsp; No one person shops in a wide variety of stores and their viewpoint is limited.&amp;nbsp; But not all stores price in the same way and have the same bargaining power with their suppliers; a regional grocery chain simply can&#39;t bargain with suppliers as well as a national or international chain such as Royal Ahold.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, different stores serve different customer levels and a customer at Trader Joes won&#39;t feel the same pain as one in rural Indiana.&amp;nbsp; When a store raises prices or passes along steath inflationary packaging, you might see it in your store but on a macro&#45;level, it might not be fully processed through the entire system and hence not fully reflected in the CPI.
Here&#39;s my own perspective on the issue of CPI reliability.&amp;nbsp; I have come to believe that the mechanism is fundamentally sound, even if the presence of so many &quot;fingers in the pot&quot; can make pricing problematic at times.&amp;nbsp; But if there&#39;s issue to be taken, it&#39;s to be taken at the upper levels of the government, who split out the more critical sector of food from the CPI component when they determine what increases to put through for benefit recipients.</body>

<title>Honesty at the College Visit</title>
<body>This weekend saw yet another college visit for Middle, who is now in his senior year of high school.&amp;nbsp; It occurred at a major urban east coast university and naturally, the place was festooned for the thousands of visiting prospects and parents, who were respectively excited and terrified.&amp;nbsp; Before the breakout sessions for the Admissions/Aid and then the various individual academic schools within the university structure, there was the obligatory reach&#45;&#39;n&#45;grab for all manner of flyers, pens and cheap lanyards as the herd milled past the tables set up in the arena concourse.&amp;nbsp; For all of the obligatory rah&#45;rah however, there was a session of clarity and honesty in the early afternoon and it was eye&#45;opening for the handful who were in attendance.
Middle is an arts kid &#45; creative and talented, someone who appreciates the poetry of E.E. Cummings more than the need to subtract &#45; and in his element, he&#39;s a wonder to behold.&amp;nbsp; All of the paternal gush now aside, we joined dozens of students and parents for the Theatre Department&#39;s information session.&amp;nbsp; It was hosted by the Theatre Department&#39;s Assistant Chair as well as the graduate theatre program director, each with years of experience running this nationally recognized program and it occurred in the front rows before a stage undergoing transformation to the mythical Scottish village of Brigadoon.&amp;nbsp; The department chair spoke about the program and it&#39;s structure, as well as the various concentrations and where the graduates were getting work.&amp;nbsp; He then however, commented that if the students were hoping to come here and then simply make it into the big&#45;time, they were suffering from a notion that was preposterous; they would work diligently and hard to learn a craft that might earn them a weekly wage of $150 to start.&amp;nbsp; As he discussed the capabilities of the various adjunct faculty, he told of a graduate who had been on Broadway but was now back and teaching as her mother was helping care for the graduate&#39;s child since the typical Broadway salary didn&#39;t allow for the burden of childcare expenses.&amp;nbsp; I glanced at Middle, who was silently digesting all of the information that was more telling of reality than he&#39;d get from the glossy brochures that inundate the mailbox.&amp;nbsp; The two of them also acknowledged that they were glad that it was far more affordable for the in&#45;state kids and they didn&#39;t blink when a mother later asked about the state residency requirements; this woman was a heavily&#45;accented immigrant who would be willing to move to make this work for her child, even if it meant that her child would have to wait a year for the opportunity.
When it was over, we joined a group who were waiting to make personal comments or ask questions.&amp;nbsp; I thanked the gentleman for his candor and he remarked that he very much understood the issue of tuition.&amp;nbsp; When he himself was in high school, he had the opportunity to attend a college for free and his own father decreed you will go here.&amp;nbsp; He then touched his index finger to his thumb to make a small circle that he placed before his eye, and commented that it made a huge difference for him, allowing him to take advantage of opportunities that paid nothing yet provided real dividends for his career.&amp;nbsp; Middle stood nearby listening, taking all of this in and it was invaluable since it wasn&#39;t coming from the &#39;rents.
The old reality of college &#45; the best seven years of my life, as Bluto Blutarsky once commented &#45; is dead.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know where Middle will ultimately wind up or what he&#39;ll do and I know that the decision will be hashed out in the coming months.&amp;nbsp; But there were three lessons that I believe he took with him from the sessions.&amp;nbsp; The first is that beneath the glossy exteriors and play to the emotions, this is a difficult first lesson in finding the balance between the dreams and the adult realities of the present&#45;day world.&amp;nbsp; The second lesson is probably more important, and that is that this is a decision that will be made with the parents; indeed, the folks might just be more far&#45;sighted than he realizes as he comes to terms with the reality that you can&#39;t have it all, despite what it proclaimed in advertising.&amp;nbsp; The third lesson is that it&#39;s not just his own Mom and Dad who are asking hard questions, ones that he simply doesn&#39;t yet grasp as a teenager.
This coming weekend will see yet another college visit and this time, we&#39;ll go as a family and bring Youngest along.&amp;nbsp;He&#39;ll be bored at moments and that&#39;s fine, he&#39;s old and disciplined enough to suffer well for the short duration.&amp;nbsp; But my hope is that even years away from this decision, he&#39;ll take enough in to see the process so that he&#39;s not so swayed by the marketing that&#39;s printed to sway the kids.&amp;nbsp; Because last week, he &#45; now in seventh grade &#45; looked at a brochure sitting on the kitchen island and stated man, I wanna go here &#39;cause everyone looks so friendly.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the boy&#39;s coming along.</body>

<title>Politicians and Parenthood:&nbsp; The Message</title>
<body>There&#39;s a huge and well&#45;deserved knock on politicians, and if a kid states that she someday wants to be a politician then the response of most would be to fault the parents. &amp;nbsp; But there is one particular attribute of successful politicians that parents should remember:  stay on message.&amp;nbsp;
Staying on message means that you aren&#39;t easily distracted from one or more salient points that you continually return to when you&#39;re with the kids.&amp;nbsp; There can be entire weeks that you don&#39;t mention that message but if the opportunity arises, you return to it consistently, bringing the point home again, and again.&amp;nbsp; The message is typically something that drives you and that you want the kids to take to heart, that they&#39;ll carry with them moving forward.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a message that is short and succinct, a parental tagline that fits into the short attention span mindset and is especially crucial in a period in which the kids are getting more conversation from the entertainment/media complex than from their own parents.
In my particular childhood and youth, there were two salient messages that came through from both of my parents.&amp;nbsp; My mother&#39;s mantra &#45; derived from a Great Depression childhood &#45; was simply we&#39;ve gotta pay the mortgage. &amp;nbsp; In a society in which the consumerist mentality had begun to blossom, this simple message was the response to the purposefully created need versus want confusion.&amp;nbsp; You can certainly ask for the latest and greatest toy or trip, but we&#39;ve gotta pay the mortgage, so your wants be damned, the need of putting a roof over the head first must be met.&amp;nbsp; When I got a little older, it became a running joke with the family and I&#39;d sit at the dinner table, taking potshots like an absurdist ass:  Mom, can I have a new pair of shoes?&amp;nbsp; Nope, (answering myself) gotta pay the mortgage.&amp;nbsp; Mom, can I please have a second helping of carrots?&amp;nbsp; Nope, (answering myself) gotta pay the mortgage.&amp;nbsp; My mother suffered the slings in good grace and it wasn&#39;t until I was finally living in my own apartment with the full freedom and responsibility of adulthood that this message came back.&amp;nbsp; I worked for a corporation with a load of other twenty&#45;somethings and the conversation amongst multiple co&#45;workers would turn to spending on this or that and presented with a particular decision on a major purchase decision, I found that phrase creep back repeatedly into my head:  gotta pay the mortgage.&amp;nbsp; I could certainly afford the particular item if I took a second job to cover the cost along with the other necessities, such as rent.&amp;nbsp; But the stretch was such that if I lost my primary job, I&#39;d be forced to return home.&amp;nbsp; Gotta pay the mortgage.
The message from my father was blunter and broader:  pull your head out of your ass and look around.&amp;nbsp; It was a message that I received repeatedly from around fourth grade onwards, when the thought process starting going to hell.&amp;nbsp; It was harsh and consistent, and would be trotted out when he&#39;d encounter some &#39;tween/teen stupidity that either I or my sister had said or done.&amp;nbsp; It also became a weird form of bonding between the two of us and when I reached my later teens, we&#39;d actually joke about it and he&#39;d even note that he&#39;d done something proving that he&#39;d demonstrably had his head up his own ass.&amp;nbsp; It was only in my adulthood when he began to open up to my wife and I about his Korean War experiences that the import behind this message came home.&amp;nbsp; There was certainly an element of fate about whether or not a shrapnel fragment or bullet took you out, but there was also an element of carelessness and lack of thought that got you killed as well.&amp;nbsp; As a company first sergeant, which he reached at the tender age of 20 via the demise of his predecessors, he routinely told new arrivals that if they wanted to survive, they&#39;d better find one of the veterans and pay attention to what they did and then copy it.&amp;nbsp; The verbal message to me was harsh but he never scared me with the stories of why he stressed attention, awareness and thought; that phrase is one that I swore that I&#39;d never use with my own kids but there have been a very few instances when it&#39;s been trotted out.&amp;nbsp;
My own taglines are simple and one of them is a G&#45;rated version of my father&#39;s acidic remark: Think.&amp;nbsp; Use your head for more than just a hatrack.&amp;nbsp; The second pertains to the college experience and debt, we need to get you through with as little debt as possible and I talk consistently about the impact of debt on the ability to actually get out of the house and on with their own lives.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no guarantee of what job or career you&#39;ll get, but there&#39;s no sense making things worse by starting out with a small mortgage hung around your neck.&amp;nbsp; The phrases aren&#39;t embroidered and hung upon the wall nor are they used on a daily basis, but I try to use them consistently and in the same format every time so that it winds up as a rhetorical bumper sticker pasted to their thought process, one that they see every time that they decide to take it out for a ride.
Understand that when the kids get older and more into the world of school and peers, your time around them will lessen.&amp;nbsp; Decide what you value and the lessons that you wish to impart and then find the tagline that best captures what you want to say.&amp;nbsp; Then deliver it again and again and again.&amp;nbsp; Expect that you might even be teased, but keep it up because it&#39;s sinking in and it&#39;s liable to be at a crucial moment in your child&#39;s life when that tagline pops into his head and makes all the difference in a particular choice facing him.</body>

<title>Teen (Un)Employment</title>
<body>One of the big knocks on the new and improved economy is the status of (un)employment.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a push amongst the fast food workers for a higher minimum wage of $15/hour and the response of the fast food industry is to automate the process, rendering the great majority of the workers obsolete.&amp;nbsp; But the real cost of an actual increase in the minimum to $15/hour will be borne by the teenagers, who are forced out of the job market entirely.&amp;nbsp; First, they came for the newspaper carriers and I said nothing, then they came for the yard work and I said nothing...&amp;nbsp; The worst regions of teen unemployment are in the urban areas and there are still part&#45;time and summer jobs available for teens in our area, but there are signs that it&#39;s getting interesting.
MIddle has worked on a part&#45;time basis for a friend&#39;s small organ repair firm for several years, initially doing the cleanup and yard work.&amp;nbsp; But he came in one day about two months ago and as we chatted, noted that one of the older guys at this small business had commented that he&#39;d be leaving and that it would indeed be permanently.&amp;nbsp; He commented to my son that work was thinning out with far less to do so he might as well just retire.&amp;nbsp; The subsequent kitchen conversation with Middle centered around the idea that if there wasn&#39;t sufficient work to keep the adults busy, his days as a teen employee would probably be numbered; that was indeed what happened as our friend had to release him for lack of work.&amp;nbsp; In the interim, Middle did look for other part&#45;time jobs to keep some money in his pocket and his bank account.
What caught my attention was what he encountered at a fast food restaurant.&amp;nbsp; This is actually a pita joint that we&#39;ve frequented and in a nearby college neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; The food is decent and the owner was advertising at one point for help.&amp;nbsp; Middle took an application and then completed it; what he found when he returned it  however, was that they wouldn&#39;t accept it unless he also provided a resume.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, a resume?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a variant of a fast food joint and the guy is asking for a resume before considering the application?&amp;nbsp; Part of my internal monologue is that there&#39;s a reasonable explanation for this, perhaps to teach the youngsters how to walk through the process and give them a taste of what is really required when they hit the pavement looking for a job.&amp;nbsp; Yet the other part of me responds that it&#39;s a pita joint fer chrissakes, so have we reached the point that the increased competition is going to be handled much as though they were applying for a position at Chase?&amp;nbsp; The tongue&#45;in&#45;cheek remarks about delivering newspapers and mowing yards are actually true, as the teens are pushed out of those jobs by adults who have in turned been pushed out, much as Native American tribes jostled with one another &#45; sometimes violently &#45; as many moved westwards to escape the coming of the settlers.&amp;nbsp;
Most Americans don&#39;t think past the short&#45;term implications such as the kids having less spending money and more free time.&amp;nbsp; But there is a longer&#45;term implication as is already being seen in Europe, particularly along the southern periphery, with youth unemployment reaching upwards of 40% and higher.&amp;nbsp; This is a society&#45;killer as the young adults, locked out of adulthood and unable to get a real start on their own, turn surly and ultimately violent.&amp;nbsp; This is the condition which has led in part to any number of disturbances as desperate and dissatisfied young adults turn to violence to show their frustration.&amp;nbsp; But now the trend towards teen employment has turned a corner and it&#39;s come to a small, mostly white&#45;bread Mid&#45;Atlantic city where teens are being expected to handle job searches as adults for positions that will never allow them to afford actually taking their place in the economic world of independent adults.
For the record, Middle took my advice and let it go, finding another job as he proceeds through high school.</body>

<title>Per the Federal Reserve, We&#8217;re &#8220;Hoarding Money&#8221;</title>
<body>In a recent article discussing the dramatic decline in monetary velocity &#45; the number of times that a dollar is turned over in the economy as a measure of economic activity &#45; the author states that The answer lies in the private sector’s dramatic increase in their willingness to hoard money instead of spend it. To which I, as a member of the private sector, can only reply no shit, Sherlock.
This simple comment is clearly symptomatic of multiple issues facing American society today.
The first is the simple use of the term hoard, a word with clearly pejorative connotations.&amp;nbsp; To previous generations of Americans, the term was save and it was something that was done because the responsibility for the family future was overwhelmingly the responsibility of the family itself.&amp;nbsp; Saving was something done because there were responsibilities such as educating the kids and providing for retirement and it was considered unfortunate and unseemly and unwise to place yourself at the mercy of others.&amp;nbsp; But using the term hoard implies that we are both selfish for not spending and perhaps just a bit mentally ill; gathering everything around us irrationally in fear of the future, retreating to our own little worlds and ignoring the outside world.
The second is the sense that the mandarins at the Fed simply don&#39;t see things as the rest of us.&amp;nbsp; Families now have greater uncertainty and competing demands upon their resources.&amp;nbsp; The median family wealth has fallen by a full third in the past decade, the median family income is lower than before and yet it&#39;s becoming clear that the fiscal obligations facing the family are rising.&amp;nbsp; The passage of the Affordable Care Act &#45; Obamacare &#45; is hitting more families with higher medical insurance costs than before and as businesses cut out the benefits, then the medical bills themselves will rise as families take on higher and higher deductibles in order to afford even the smallest premiums.&amp;nbsp; The decline of the pension plan means that we&#39;re now responsible for our own retirements and parents wonder how in God&#39;s name they&#39;re going to get the kids educated.
The third is the illustration of the extent to which our economy is now dependent upon consumption as an economic driver in lieu of everything else.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re supposed to ignore the flashing check engine light on our dashboard and continue spending; the point of how off&#45;the&#45;rails we&#39;d become was driven home after 9/11 when the president commented that we shouldn&#39;t let the terrorists take over our daily lives but should go shopping instead.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re now caught in an impossible position.&amp;nbsp; The realities facing the family are significant yet the mandarins view the impetus to drive the economy &#45; to spend &#45; as paramount because they don&#39;t seem to realize that we&#39;re now trapped, and the push to spend is all that they can offer.
In keeping with the present horror craze, many describe ours as a zombie economy.&amp;nbsp; There is no more life left in the consumer model as the family faces competing and frankly, more important, demands upon its resources.&amp;nbsp; Yet the system &#45; and folks, the Fed is at the heart of the system &#45; describes the common&#45;sense response in the pejorative and implies that if we only freed ourselves from our delusions, all would be better.&amp;nbsp; Understand this:  the old system is dying rapidly, if it&#39;s not fully dead yet.&amp;nbsp; The system can only push what the system knows, even if it&#39;s ultimately more harmful to our families.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - September 2014:&nbsp; New Highs Reached</title>
<body>The pricing is in for the September 2014 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index and what really caught my eye was the proud New Look! advertised in the upper right corner of the Dial Soap packaging.&amp;nbsp; This makes up for the fact that the soap offered now comes in packages of six bars instead of the previous eight bars, another example of stealth inflation that we&#39;ve seen over the years.&amp;nbsp; This product is one of the multiple reasons that the PracticalDad Price Index has risen in September to new highs for both the 47 item marketbasket Full Index as well as the 37 item Food&#45;Only Subindex.
The Total Index of 47 items rose to a new high of 111.07 (November 2010 = 100) and the Food&#45;Only Subindex of 37 foodstuff items also rose to a new high of 114.73 (November 2010 = 100), surpassing the previous high index of 114.33 reached in December 2012.
What was notable about the month&#39;s data was that stealth inflation has occurred again.&amp;nbsp; In the first instance, a grocer&#39;s store brand package of hot dogs decreased in size from a previous package of 16 ounces to the new package of 15 ounces for the same number of hot dogs.&amp;nbsp; This particular grocer has consistently had the highest priced dogs amongst the three separate sampled grocers and it&#39;s impossible to determine yet if the other two will follow along with this move.&amp;nbsp; The other instance of stealth inflation will be followed by the other two within the next several months since that product is a national brand, Dial Bath Soap; the new package size comprises six bars instead of the previous eight bars and was found on the shelf of one of the stores.&amp;nbsp; As the others sell off that inventory, they will also begin to sell the reduced size packaging of six bars of soap.&amp;nbsp; The New Look! advertised supposedly refers to the individual bar but with no previous bar for comparison, I can only note that the new look refers to the size of the entire package.&amp;nbsp; In each of these instances, I have continued as before by adjusting the price to reflect what it would be selling for the original package sizing.
Since much attention has been placed on the rise in protein prices, most specifically ground beef, I thought it would be worth noting that in the almost four years since the start of the PracticalDad Price Index, a pound of 80% lean ground beef has risen by 44%, from the November 2010 average price of $3.02/lb. to $4.36/lb.&amp;nbsp; The results for September and the previous three months are listed below.

<title>A Nine Year-Old With an Uzi?</title>
<body>On the news that a nine year&#45;old girl accidentally killed a shooting instructor with an Uzi submachine gun, I could only sit back in slack&#45;jawed wonder and shake my head in literal disbelief.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, who in the hell even considered that this would be a good idea?&amp;nbsp; The range owner?&amp;nbsp; The parents?&amp;nbsp; The dead instructor?&amp;nbsp; Certainly, common sense died well before the child took the weapon and it&#39;s with that that the questions now arise once again about gun control.&amp;nbsp; But even before you get to the philosophical questions about the right to bear arms in America, what are some of the common sense questions that a parent should ask before allowing their child to handle a firearm, if at all?
As a full disclosure, I am a gun owner and have had each of my three children undergo basic pistol training with a trained instructor.</body>

<title>Re-setting the Home Page</title>
<body>As schools across the country struggle with budget issues, the majority are looking squarely at one line item for control &#45; paper.&amp;nbsp; So information is now being made available via other means and it&#39;s probably in your best interest to reset the browser&#39;s home page to the school district website.&amp;nbsp; Kids still come home from school on the first day with a backpack full of paperwork and parents are used to sitting down and culling through the chaff to get to those single pieces of wheat which really do concern them, but it&#39;s afterwards that the paper usage is being truly controlled to save money.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that if you expect to see the information in the kids&#39; backpacks, then you&#39;re liable to miss something important.
It was at a different event the other evening that someone shared a statistic that her spouse had picked up at a local school district staff meeting: if the district could cut it&#39;s paper cost by 10%, the savings would be sufficient to fund the salaries and benefits of two additional teachers.&amp;nbsp; So the hunt for eliminating paper usage continues in an era of budgetary constraints and it&#39;s showing up here &#45; or not, actually &#45; in the household.&amp;nbsp; School calendars sent to each household with a full complement of activities and events?&amp;nbsp; Gone.&amp;nbsp; Paper reminders from advisers?&amp;nbsp; Gone.&amp;nbsp; School planners for each student?&amp;nbsp; Actually not, since the much&#45;smaller and less costly planner was a train&#45;wreck for kids who don&#39;t have the capacity to write in very small print; this led to the re&#45;introduction of the older and larger planners.&amp;nbsp; If the schools are going to stress planning skills, then they have to at least give them something with which to work and the less&#45;costly alternative was simply not functional.
The godsend however, is that the information is now being made available online and readily available, provided that the parents are willing to keep up with it.&amp;nbsp; Site tabs lead to school lunch menus and athletic calendars, directories and a full gamut of district policies.&amp;nbsp; Student and district achievements are touted routinely.&amp;nbsp; But the real value of putting the district site on the browser homepage is in those announcements that make you appreciate the heads up, such as the announcement that Youngest&#39;s school would be the site for after&#45;school SWAT team training.&amp;nbsp; Had I not seen the article yesterday morning, I would have been mightily surprised when one of Youngest&#39;s friends told me last night that the SWAT team was there during his after&#45;school football practice, a tragic training necessity given the times in which we live.&amp;nbsp;
So for the next number of years, the browser&#39;s home page will be set to the school district&#39;s site and the only question will be with what is it replaced when we&#39;ve finally got the kids through the educational pipeline.&amp;nbsp; And for Middle, who might read this:  whatever it is, it won&#39;t be AARP.</body>

<title>Exposing the Kids to Reality</title>
<body>It was the other day that Youngest, now with a PS3, asked for permission to buy the Call&#45;of&#45;Duty: Black Ops game and my response was a firm no.&amp;nbsp; I understand that he&#39;s played the game elsewhere, will certainly play it again at some friend&#39;s house and that&#39;s alright.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve made it clear that I won&#39;t be purchasing such a game because I want him to understand that there&#39;s a grim reality behind the virtual sterility of the two&#45;dimensional game, a world of pain and loss that only the combat&#45;initiated can truly understand.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a function of my own father, who returned home from the first year of the Korean War a changed man who sold his hunting rifles and swore to neither fire a weapon nor sleep outside again.&amp;nbsp; It was this desire to teach the reality that led to a Swedish father&#39;s trek with his two sons when they asked for a Call&#45;of&#45;Duty game.
This father took his two sons on a journey to the Middle East in early 2014 to show them the reality of warfare.&amp;nbsp; Much of the game &#45; like other first&#45;person shooter games &#45; takes place in an urban wasteland of ruins and debris.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s one thing to move among the virtual debris and fully another to see the rubble around you and recognize that it doesn&#39;t go away as it does when the television is turned off; let alone the notion that the people there have to live among it with the knowledge that to them, that brick pile might at one time have been called home.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an admittedly over&#45;the&#45;top exercise, an expensive lesson that does however, prove his commitment to his personal beliefs.&amp;nbsp; In the course of the two week excursion, they visited a refugee camp and had the figurative impact of young people paralyzed by taking rubber bullets to the spine with the commentary that these youngsters, their own age, would never again be able to engage in any of their favorite sports and activities.
This father does understand that he and his wife are not the only adults having a conversation with their sons.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that the kids &#45; all of them &#45; are having an ongoing conversation with the media/entertainment complex and honestly, it&#39;s occurring more readily with many than with the parents.&amp;nbsp; The great majority of fathers in today&#39;s world spend less than a half hour each day in any meaningful interaction with the kids while the kids themselves are having a good six hours daily in some interaction with the media/entertainment complex.&amp;nbsp; That complex can be seductive and fun, requiring nothing of the kids apart from their brand loyalty and ongoing viewership.&amp;nbsp; The complex has no other role in raising the child and demands nothing, holds none accountable for grades or chores and will never, ever have to clean up the pieces when the child or teen does something that goes spectacularly, explosively wrong.&amp;nbsp; The only surefire option to competing with the complex is to go full&#45;tilt Amish and for the great majority, that&#39;s neither a valid choice nor even an option; what is required at the minimum is the understanding that the other conversations exist and more importantly, the ongoing effort to continually engage the kids whenever and wherever the opportunity arises.
We&#39;ve had similar opportunities for mind&#45;expansion in this household, although not to the extent of Mr. Helgegren.&amp;nbsp; The first was the decision to let Youngest watch Saving Private Ryan as a third grader.&amp;nbsp; I knew from conversations that he was playing Black Ops at friends&#39; houses, yet wanted him to have a sense of the reality of war and the Spielberg film was the closest that I could conceivably get short of taking the kids to an actual war zone.&amp;nbsp; The effect was what I hoped as he was clearly moved at the grinding violence of the film&#39;s opening invasion sequence and it served as the departure point for further, later conversations.&amp;nbsp; The other major occurrence was the decision &#45; only a few weeks after viewing the film &#45; to take the kids to Athens&#39; Syntagma Square during the much awaited &#45; and saved for &#45; trip to Europe.&amp;nbsp; The demonstrations that year took off on the first leg of our trip to Rome and I made repeated visits on the hotel computer to the US State Department website to determine whether there had been a travel advisory issued for Athens.&amp;nbsp; Between that and touching base with the tour company&#39;s guides in Athens, we decided to go ahead with that leg of the trip and while it was safe, it was eye&#45;opening for the kids to see militarized riot police and to do so a full three years before the rest of America saw them in Ferguson, Missouri.
And that&#39;s the point of exposing the kids to the reality.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s important that we as parents act in what has become an almost counter&#45;cultural fashion because the culture now promotes behaviors and norms that are crass at best and detrimental at worst to the well&#45;being of our kids.&amp;nbsp; There is liable to be blowback to our efforts at conversation and you might even wish to book tickets for a flight to Syria, one&#45;way in the worst moments.&amp;nbsp; But understand that if you keep chipping away at it, keep making an effort, keep finding ways to expose the kids to reality, then there&#39;s a decent chance that they&#39;re going to actually listen and adjust accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Letting the kids&#39; reality be shaped by the media/entertainment complex is setting them up for future heartache, unprepared for what they actually see when the blinders come off and they have to live in the real world.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index, August 2014:&nbsp; Food Inflation Picking Up Again</title>
<body>The pricing was done for the August 2014 PracticalDad Price Index and a review shows that while the cost of the 47 item grocery marketbasket declined slightly, from July&#39;s 110.20 to August&#39;s 110.14 (November 2010 = 100), the Food&#45;Only Sub&#45;index of 37 foodstuff items rose by almost a full half point, from July&#39;s 113.22 to August&#39;s 113.71 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that, when you consider the 37 foodstuff items alone, the cost of these has risen 13.71% since November 2010 and a full half percentage point in the course of a single month.
The foodstuffs (for a full listing of the PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket, see here) did not occur across the board however.&amp;nbsp; Produce and Dairy items decreased very slightly, but the rise was driven by a 2.6% increase in the price of meat &#45; ground beef, hot dogs, eggs, tuna, cooked deli ham, chicken and fish sticks &#45; from the previous month.&amp;nbsp; This is simply showing the retail effects of the supply issues in the economy as the national beef herds have decreased in size to levels not seen in 60 years and pork herds have been hit by PED, which has led to culling to control the disease.
One final comment on the results.&amp;nbsp; Over a year ago, I began to follow what I refer to as the spread and it&#39;s this which is the final column in the chart.&amp;nbsp; The idea behind the spread is to simply note the differential between the rise in food prices versus the non&#45;food prices within the basket.&amp;nbsp; What is notable about this is that the food prices have again been increasing and the spread between the Full Index and the Food&#45;Only Index is rising, showing how food costs are now outpacing and driving the basket.
The results for August and the previous three months follow.

<body>Our present home is one that was built in 1997, and we purchased out of logistical necessity in late 2007.&amp;nbsp; What I subsequently found out was that we&#39;re actually the fourth family to live in the house so that three families lived in it over the previous ten year period, for an average of three years and four months residency per family...in other words, it was flipped multiple times during the realty bubble of late &#39;90s to 2007.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, it&#39;s got a nice layout and meets our needs but we&#39;ve been encountering the flippers&#39; mentality for the past few months &#45; make it look good, but don&#39;t do shit otherwise.&amp;nbsp; Fundamental work has been ignored and I&#39;m running into previous jury&#45;rig repairs that are creating issues when other repairs have to occur; when we first purchased the house &#45; and it&#39;s only a house until we make it a home, regardless of what the realtors say &#45; I found to my amazement that the gas furnace had never been serviced since installation.&amp;nbsp; When the gas fireplace in the family room died two years later, I found the same issue as we paid to get it operational again.&amp;nbsp; So now multiple issues are occurring simultaneously and the repairs are potentially costly.&amp;nbsp; So do we pay someone to come in or do I suck it up and manage as much of it as possible?&amp;nbsp; And what does this have to do with the kids?
In a nation in which both the median family income and median wealth has declined in the better part of the last decade, the family budget really isn&#39;t able to absorb the stray hits from home and auto repair that it could say, two decades ago (or even longer if you consider the way that the use of debt hid the real effect on living standards).&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re reaching a point akin to every ninth episode of Star Trek:  Next Generation, in which Picard orders all power to the life support systems because he spent too much time reasoning with the unreasonable while they reduced his ship to wreckage.&amp;nbsp; I swear to God, Picard could have worked for the SEC or the CFTC.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, if families are now having to figure out more about helping the kids with education and taking on a greater burden in healthcare insurance and costs, let alone set aside for their dotage, there simply isn&#39;t the amount to be paid out for every last little repair around the house.&amp;nbsp; What this has to do with the kids is that they see Dad and Mom taking up the work and figuring things out.
Being a do&#45;it&#45;yourselfer requires not just a certain facility with working with your hands, but also a mindset that you&#39;re able to both figure it out and adapt when the first approach doesn&#39;t work.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve become a nation of specialists, with colleges graduating young adults with very specific skill sets and oriented towards the intellectual over the manual.&amp;nbsp; Mike Rowe of Dirty Jobs fame is probably the first person in a long time to take a crack at dispelling the notion that manual and physical jobs were beneath many Americans.&amp;nbsp; That seems to have taken root and in tandem with the realization the money isn&#39;t there, networks like HGTV and DIY have offered more and more shows to educate people on what has to be done.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve seen in my own household is a growing interest in Pinterest for ideas on projects and links to sites that teach how to do them.&amp;nbsp; This particular site has led to at least one handmade Christmas present and an ongoing effort to create glassware from old alcohol bottles that leaves my garage resembling a bootlegger&#39;s storage unit.&amp;nbsp; But while it&#39;s frustrating on one hand to know that a section of the garage is given over to that particular project, understanding that an effort is being made to try something different makes the frustration infinitely more bearable.
We live in a culture of instant gratification and that mindset bleeds through to almost everything.&amp;nbsp; Because I&#39;m a decent writer &#45; just saying &#45; I&#39;ve had parents ask me to help their kids with certain essays, as well as reading some of my own kids&#39; efforts.&amp;nbsp; What is universal amongst the youngsters is the notion that their first effort is the one to be turned in and the universal response to my typical comment that the work was a decent first draft was a consistent disbelief that it wasn&#39;t finished and presentable.&amp;nbsp; Many youngsters don&#39;t grasp the concept that something isn&#39;t going to succeed on the first try and that they might have to re&#45;group and try it a second, third and possibly fourth time and the same process holds true for many Do&#45;It&#45;Yourself household projects in which the person has little or no experience.&amp;nbsp; If the kids are going to learn this, then as parents we might have to put ourselves out there and model that behavior; study plan schematics, go back a second or third time to attempt a repair, and give a serious effort to complete the job before we finally cave in and hire out to get the job done.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s value in failing and learning how to try again.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s value in demonstrating how to use the internet to study videos on how to accomplish a task that might have previously been subbed out to a repairman.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s value in keeping track of the savings so that you can share it with the kids and put it in terms of the opportunity cost of how that money might otherwise be used.&amp;nbsp; We undertook and finished a DIY backyard fishpond refurbishment &#45; at Eldest&#39;s insistence and assistance &#45; that saved approximately $4000 off a professional&#39;s quote, savings that are worth approximately a semester&#39;s tuition at the local state university.
There are always kids who instinctively understand what has to be done in certain projects and how to use their hands.&amp;nbsp; But for many, that understanding isn&#39;t going to come if they spend six hours daily in front of a screen and it won&#39;t come if they consistently see the parents picking up the phone for an estimate and appointment.&amp;nbsp; When I began this article several days ago, I was looking at multiple repairs split between the house and the car.&amp;nbsp; The first was on Eldest&#39;s car and that&#39;s one that the two of us handled together instead of farming out to a garage.&amp;nbsp; The second will require a repairman to finish a job that I started simply because it&#39;s in a summer heat attic and my middle&#45;aged body gave up the ghost after more than four hours of effort, but at least the project is moved along far enough to save some of the labor costs.&amp;nbsp; The third is one that I&#39;m simply setting up for a professional since all of the separate literature that I read routinely mentions the prospect of significant bodily injury if performed improperly and y&#39;know, that one&#39;s just not worth it.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an imperfect process, but at least the kids are seeing that the effort is being made to keep the costs under control and that&#39;s a lesson that they&#39;re going to have to take to heart going forward.</body>

<title>A PracticalDad Look at Concussions</title>
<body>Guns don&#39;t kill people, 90 mph free kicks kill people.
&amp;nbsp; Poster on door of Middle&#39;s bedroom
It was during the second half of a mid&#45;season Division II college soccer game with the ball rolling free in the visiting team&#39;s penalty box.&amp;nbsp; Both Diane,a forward, and a defending fullback raced from opposite directions towards the ball and the defender reached it in stride about two steps ahead of Diane.&amp;nbsp; The fullback cleared the ball with a strong kick and it traveled perhaps five feet before it collided solidly with Diane&#39;s face, connecting squarely in the forehead.&amp;nbsp; Diane dropped flat onto her back, propelled torso backwards by an object kicked with sufficient force that it instantly &#45; violently &#45; eliminated all of her own forward momentum.&amp;nbsp; According to her teammates, the coach was on the field and running towards her as soon as she hit the turf; after several minutes on her back &#45; conscious the entire time &#45; Diane left for both the remainder of the game and the season.&amp;nbsp; The subsequent diagnosis from the university&#39;s medical staff was that Diane suffered a major concussion.
While it isn&#39;t a certainty that it will occur, there&#39;s a respectable chance that any active kid will suffer a concussion either through organized sports or the simple *boom* of an accident from hard play.&amp;nbsp; But what exactly is a concussion and what should you expect to see if your child suffers one?&amp;nbsp; And as a full disclosure, the PracticalDad household has had first&#45;hand experience with the injury.
A concussion is the common term for a brain trauma, a sudden event in which the brain is jarred or shaken severely enough that there&#39;s an acute injury to it.&amp;nbsp; The design of a person&#39;s head is &#45; like the rest of the human body &#45; a wonderful bit of engineering.&amp;nbsp; This crucial organ is housed within the helmet&#45;like skull, but there&#39;s actually no contact between the brain and the skull.&amp;nbsp; Between the brain and the skull is a thin layer of fluid which cushions it from the movements and shocks of everyday activity.&amp;nbsp; But a concussion can occur when the body undergoes a physical that overwhelms the cushioning capacity of the fluid and the brain is severely shaken or actually comes into contact with the skull itself.&amp;nbsp; In Diane&#39;s case, getting pounded by a 430 gram ball kicked around 60 mph is clearly beyond the body&#39;s natural absorption capacity.
We used to call a concussion getting your bell rung and the old treatment was taking a few minutes to clear your head before returning to the practice or game.&amp;nbsp; But the bright light of publicity that began years ago with the tragedy of former long&#45;time Steelers center Mike Webster and progressing most recently to San Diego&#39;s Junior Seau have brought greater awareness to the insidious damage to the brain caused by concussions, especially if they&#39;re repetitive.&amp;nbsp; The long&#45;term toll of concussions is now being given greater attention so that there are improvements both in terms of treatment as well as prevention.&amp;nbsp; What the medical community is now aware of is that the risk of long&#45;term brain damage rises with a person&#39;s number of concussions.
Concussion Rates:  Who and How Often?
For all of the attention being focused on football, a male sport, the reality is that females will suffer a significant number of concussions as well.&amp;nbsp; At the high school level, girls&#39; soccer players reported the next highest number of concussions for any sport after football and girl basketball players suffered concussions at almost the same rate as their male counterparts.&amp;nbsp; For soccer however, girl players suffered concussions at almost twice the same rate as their male counterparts; it&#39;s unclear as to why but the prevailing opinion is that it&#39;s primarily physiological as the female heads are lighter &#45; lending credence to the many fathers&#39; thoughts that boys are boneheaded &#45; and have weaker neck muscles to support the head when it&#39;s hit.&amp;nbsp; The other thought is that culture plays a role as boys are taught to &quot;suck it up&quot; while girls are more likely to say when something is wrong.
For a chart of the concussion rates per common youth sports, by gender, see here.
Additional research has shown that the incidence rate for concussion is several times higher for those who have already had a concussion; the fact that there&#39;s already been trauma creates a lower threshold for a concussion than if the individual had never had one in the first place.&amp;nbsp; In Diane&#39;s case, this was her third concussion over a three year period.
There are two upshots here.&amp;nbsp; The first is that your daughter&#45;athlete is as much at risk for a concussion as your son&#45;athlete.&amp;nbsp; The second is that if your child has already suffered a concussion, there&#39;s a lower threshold for suffering another from a head trauma than another child&#45;athlete who has not yet had a concussion.
Concussion&#39;s Symptoms and Diagnosis
What makes a concussion difficult to diagnose is that there can be interior damage to the brain even if there&#39;s no actual sign of exterior damage to the body, such as a bruise or laceration.&amp;nbsp; This is compounded by the fact that the interior damage might not be immediately evident; while Diane was visibly groggy in the immediate aftermath of the injury, she never lost consciousness and two decades ago, might even have been allowed to re&#45;enter the game if she appeared to have been able since there doesn&#39;t have to be loss of consciousness with a serious concussion.
The symptoms that arise from a concussion can be classified into four different categories.
Thinking/Memory
     Inability to concentrate
     Inability to retain new information
     Inability to think clearly (&quot;fuzziness&quot;)
     event amnesia, i.e. inability to remember what occurred for a period of time around the trauma
     demonstrably slower thinking time
Physical
     headache
     impaired vision
     nausea/vomiting
     sensitivity to light and noise
     issues with balance
     dizziness
     fatigue
Sleep
     altered sleep pattern from usual
     inability to fall asleep
Emotion and Mood
     greater irritability and/or anxiety
     periods of sadness
     flat aspect to personality for period after the trauma
The takeaway for parents with active kids is this:  if you child is struck in the head &#45; by a ball or bat (been there on both), a hard impact with wall or ground (been there, too) &#45; then there&#39;s the prospect of a concussion.&amp;nbsp; Because there might not be an immediate sign, it&#39;s best to begin the watch for these symptoms and that watch can last for days.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not easy and the child&#39;s age can make it more difficult, especially if they&#39;re younger.&amp;nbsp; For small children &#45; kindergarten or younger &#45; take it as a sign of possible concussion if he or she is showing signs of a regression in skills that you might have considered already mastered beforehand.
If you notice any of these, immediately contact your physician.&amp;nbsp; There are objective cognitive tests that can be performed and don&#39;t be surprised if a scan is ordered to ascertain if there&#39;s overt damage to the brain, such as bleeding inside the skull.&amp;nbsp; But even if there&#39;s no overt sign on the scan, the cognitive tests can help ascertain if the child has been concussed.&amp;nbsp; The only objective examination that can help ascertain the severity of the concussion would be if the child had a pre&#45;injury baseline impact test such as used by professional and college sports teams; it might sound far&#45;fetched for a child &#45; actually a teen &#45; but more middle and high schools are having their student athletes undergo them prior to the season&#39;s start.&amp;nbsp; The online test can be performed on youth as young as 11 years of age if they&#39;re involved in sports and can be performed at the office of any medical professional which offers it.&amp;nbsp; In our case, Youngest &#45; a baseball player &#45; took an impact test a year ago at a physical therapy practice which offers the test and the results are now available to serve as a baseline for future reference.&amp;nbsp; After a concussion was suffered, periodic test re&#45;takings would serve as waypoints on recovery when compared to the original baseline examination.&amp;nbsp;
Treatment of Concussions
There&#39;s no overt treatment regimen &#45; physical therapy, medication &#45; for a concussion and the only help is what was once called the tincture of time.&amp;nbsp; That said, the tincture can be aided by a simple regimen of true rest; this is rest not only from strenuous activity or exercise which might continue to shake the brain, but also rest from the single activity that preoccupies the majority of the waking time of most adolescents, electronics.
When the brain is concussed, the purpose of the recovery period is to avoid any physical stressors to the brain.&amp;nbsp; That certainly includes minimal physical activity and more sleep but what most don&#39;t realize is that there are other stressors and these include light, noise and the constant input of watching the flickering of any kind of electronic screen.&amp;nbsp; When I spoke with Diane&#39;s father, he commented that he was surprised to find that the treatment regimen for his daughter included as little screen time as possible as the flickering, combined with the constant eye movements, were stressors that aggravated the brain and actually lengthened the recovery period.&amp;nbsp; Other aspects of the treatment regimen included the wearing of sunglasses and a visored cap when outside to shade the eyes and the absolute minimum of traveling so that she couldn&#39;t even attend away games with her team, if only to stand on the sideline.&amp;nbsp; In other words, she was to avoid any movement and sensory stimuli that typically cause the brain to work.&amp;nbsp; This treatment regimen was to continue for as long as she had symptoms and in Diane&#39;s case, the symptoms continued for a full six weeks before she was finally cleared to return to play and by that point, the season was finished.
The upshot for parents is this.&amp;nbsp; What provides the greatest entertainment for youth today &#45; electronic media &#45; is one of the activities that has to be minimized, if not completely avoided, if the kid is going to recover both the most fully and in the shortest time possible.&amp;nbsp; The small upside is that the kids at greatest risk of concussion are the athletes and are probably on the screens less that the six hour daily average.&amp;nbsp; Yet the kid will still have to avoid the screens as much as possible for the recovery and the stress in the household will be greatly elevated as parents have to take into account the mood and temperament of a child who not only suffers from concussion symptoms, but can&#39;t even find respite in those activities which were previously entertaining.
A concussion is a frustrating injury for parents.&amp;nbsp; It requires vigilance from parents to maintain the rest regimen for a full recovery but it cannot be easily judged as to how it&#39;s progressing.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the child should be kept away from the typical favorite pastimes and the stage will be set for potential conflict between child and parent.&amp;nbsp; The other issue for parents is that in their youthful sense of invincibility, the kids don&#39;t always understand that they&#39;re at an increased risk of reinjury when compared to their uninjured peers and many will balk at the notion that they might not be able to play their favorite sport again.</body>

<title>And *Boom*...</title>
<body>...went the summer as one of the kids suffered injuries that have ended his &#45; and our &#45; summer.&amp;nbsp; The accident resulted in a significant orthopedic injury that terminated any plans for baseball or scout camp, as well as any other physical activity.&amp;nbsp; But insult to injury was a concussion that meant that the mental activities that could relieve boredom &#45; television, reading, computer &#45; are also out the window as brain rest is required while the brain heals and sorts itself out.&amp;nbsp;
We are fortunate however, in that it could have been far, far worse.&amp;nbsp; So we&#39;ll take the hit and give thanks for what we have, and I&#39;ll go back to the role of nurse.</body>

<title>Re-evaluating the Pets</title>
<body>It&#39;s interesting how things align since I&#39;ve just asked Eldest to take the dog outside, on the heels of looking at past bills paid and learning that the BRICS are now forming a $100 Billion Development bank to rival the IMF .&amp;nbsp; So how do I bridge from the distant sound of dollar&#45;decline to the family dog?&amp;nbsp; The leap is because within the next number of years, the money is probably not going to be there to manage the niceties to which many American families have become accustomed, such as family pets.&amp;nbsp;
This is an animal&#45;friendly family, not so much for political/fashion reasons as much as the simple fact that we just like animals.&amp;nbsp; What started as a single stray cat adopted two months after I married my wife &#45; and I&#39;m a dog guy, so you can see how that early power&#45;struggle turned out &#45; has now morphed into a present stable of four rescued cats, a rescued dog and a rescued snake.&amp;nbsp; Until two months ago, there was also a rescued hamster but he has since moved on to that great wheel in the sky.&amp;nbsp; Simply put, we take in animals and give them homes.&amp;nbsp; But how many resources should be spent on all of these animals, given the ongoing winnowing of the middle class?
We&#39;re no different than millions of other Americans who spent more than $56 billion dollars in 2013 on their various and sundry pets.&amp;nbsp; The cost goes beyond food to veterinary bills, toys, corollary products and even pet medications and pet health insurance and God knows that we&#39;ve covered several of those categories.&amp;nbsp; Our intent has always been to take in strays and rescues since (a) they&#39;re there, and (b) they&#39;re relatively cheap, at least in comparison to the cost of a purebred puppy or kitten.&amp;nbsp; But it was within the past year that the sense of restraint blew straight through to hell because of three separate animals.
The first animal was a temporary addition to the household, a cat who Eldest found in an animal shelter.&amp;nbsp; Although we were at the full complement of alloted animals, an allotment agreed upon because I simply can&#39;t handle any more, a dispensation was made because the shelter assured her that this cat was terminally ill and that they simply wanted him adopted out so that he could die in comfort.&amp;nbsp; One of my concerns to Eldest was financial &#45; how much extra medical was going to be required and for how much would we be on the hook?&amp;nbsp; Assured that the death was likely within weeks, I agreed and &quot;McGee&quot; joined the family although he was restricted to the basement so that the potential upset with four other cats was minimized.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, what should have been a cat hospice morphed into a long&#45;term care facility as McGee rebounded with comfortable new surroundings and attention and a very few weeks of life extended into months.&amp;nbsp; There were a few vet visits with labwork, expensive enough, and then McGee finally began a decline that signaled the approaching end.&amp;nbsp; The unfortunate part of this decline was a loss of physical control that utterly ruined Pergo flooring and required my efforts to replace an approximately 60 square foot section with the unused flooring left over from installation years ago.&amp;nbsp; Had I not kept the unused flooring for use in piecing together repair, the upshot would have been several thousand dollars in new flooring.&amp;nbsp; We subsequently had him put down because his health had finally declined both precipitously and disastrously, for him and for us.
The second animal was our elderly Golden Retriever, who we took in as a pup from a local family because she was picked on and badgered by their older dog, for whom they had purchased her as a companion animal (because every pet needs a pet, right?).&amp;nbsp; This lovable spastic girl, had she been human, would have been on meds for ADHD and was periodically frustrating in her goofiness.&amp;nbsp; The costs for Cassie were what you&#39;d expect for a responsible dog&#45;owner with vet and food bills; as she aged however, we did shift the care during vacations and other absences from a kennel to a responsible known&#45;quantity teen who could housesit for us in our absence.&amp;nbsp; The thought process in this shift was two&#45;fold since we&#39;d have to have someone come in to monitor the cats anyways and it could also allow the dollars spent to go even more locally, to a teen who could apply it to college.&amp;nbsp;
The financial hole came late one evening last year, the night before we were to leave for a week&#39;s vacation, when Cassie stepped on a glass shard from a jar that had broken when it was dropped by one of the kids the day before.&amp;nbsp; Although the kid had done a presumably thorough job in cleaning up the mess, he didn&#39;t account for the fact that shards could travel into the next room and lodge themselves into the carpet.&amp;nbsp; I had just finished an article and when I stepped away from the computer, found the retriever licking furiously at her paw to stem the prodigious blood flow from the wound; the shard had done far enough into the paw to sever the artery and the blood was flowing freely into the carpet.&amp;nbsp; Because this was a late night, the option was to get her to the emergency vet center and that&#39;s what happened to my night&#45;before&#45;late morning departure while my wife and older kids went to work on the blood in the family room carpet.
This veterinary center has a policy that after initially addressing the immediate problem, the manager will speak with the pet owner and provide an estimate as to the cost of actual treatment for the injury or illness.&amp;nbsp; My situation, according to the manager, was a deep puncture wound with a severed artery &#45; and she would&#39;ve bled to death if you hadn&#39;t found her &#45; that required full&#45;blown surgery to repair, including general anesthesia, to the tune of more than $1100.&amp;nbsp; I blanched at the cost and texted with my wife, but it didn&#39;t occur to either of us not to proceed, and I was frankly surprised that the manager was actually happy and relieved that we&#39;d do so.&amp;nbsp; This was my first inkling that the middle&#45;class winnowing has hit the pet business since the manager&#39;s experience was that many owners would simply have cut their losses at the visit and opted for euthanasia.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that I returned home in the early morning with a thoroughly groggy and miserable dog, who required considerably more care from Eldest&#39;s housesitting friend during the coming week, including a followup appointment with our regular vet.&amp;nbsp;
It was around the time of the dog&#39;s injury that my wife&#39;s beloved older cat, Bear, became notably off in his behavior.&amp;nbsp; As with the other animals, Bear was adopted as a stray, but this was a cat who was as much a gentleman as any male of any species that I&#39;ve ever seen.&amp;nbsp; He was lovingly attentive to his person &#45; my wife &#45; and actually helped maintain order amongst the other animals in the household, including the retriever.&amp;nbsp; When we adopted two male kitten siblings years ago, I witnessed this cat physically corner the two little ones after a rambunctious period and discipline them, laying down the law to them in whatever language that the felines use with one another; it was honestly one of the more amazing things that I&#39;ve seen in my years.&amp;nbsp; When the listlessness and mewing continued for a few days, we took him to our regular vet, who diagnosed him with bladder cancer.&amp;nbsp; Because there were actually surgical options, we opted for that route but after several months with some improvement, Bear declined dramatically and we were forced to put him down to save him further pain.
And several weeks later, I had to return to the emergency vet one evening when the retriever suddenly couldn&#39;t walk.&amp;nbsp; The girl was suffering from a liver tumor that had ruptured and was now bleeding out internally, a situation that was simply untreatable and within 90 minutes of arrival at the vet center, she was put down.&amp;nbsp; It was honestly a relief to know that it was untreatable since I was mentally tallying the costs that we&#39;d incurred in the previous three months and it spared me from having to make an unpleasant choice of euthanasia or further treatment costs.&amp;nbsp; For a guy who prides himself on a straight&#45;forward and logical approach to things, I was torn by multiple thorns: sadness that this sweet, goofy girl was leaving; anger at myself that I could have missed any early warning signs that might have prevented this sudden trainwreck; concern over the amount of money that I might wind up spending; and a strange wish to show the center staff that I was indeed a good guy and not a cheapskate who wouldn&#39;t spring for treatment.&amp;nbsp; The reality was that I really didn&#39;t have a choice but that still hasn&#39;t salved the lingering irritation.
The financial upshot of these incidents cost us in the thousands of dollars over a three month period, money that I had simply had no idea would be incurred and far beyond the usual monthly costs that we incur for our animals.&amp;nbsp; After a recent visit to the vet for another animal, the office manager commented that I might want to consider purchasing health insurance for the animals; an expenditure that I simply find objectionable given the human need that we face in America.&amp;nbsp; But the events and my responses also demonstrate that the new generations of American parents are going to have to be willing and able to steel themselves for the instances when the cost of pet ownership momentarily spirals out of control, to simply say no and cut the losses when they occur.
Economists understand that there&#39;s a principle called opportunity cost, meaning that the money spent now could instead be spent in another way or saved for a different priority.&amp;nbsp; The consumerist mindset of having it all has combined with the easy credit availability to lull people into thinking that choices don&#39;t have to be made when you can do both, paying for at least one over time.&amp;nbsp; But one of the recurring thoughts during that period was the realization that the money was finite and there were uses for that money elsewhere; in at least one of three animal situations, emotions took over the thought process.&amp;nbsp; My philosophy is now changing to recognize that there is indeed opportunity cost for my family, especially now that another kid is looking at college.&amp;nbsp; What will happen now is the admission that we simply can&#39;t afford the extended care and recognizing that in providing a loving home for these cast&#45;offs, they&#39;re still far better off than they might have been otherwise.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index July 2014:&nbsp; Eating Hamburgers for Fiber</title>
<body>It&#39;s a less than delicious irony that on the day that I gathered the prices for the July 2014 PracticalDad Price Index, I stopped at a local Burger King for a Whopper and fries.&amp;nbsp; Later that evening, I read that Burger King is one of a number of fast&#45;food chains that are extending beef supplies &#45; and padding profits &#45; by using MCC (Microcrystalline Cellulose), aka wood pulp in their burgers.&amp;nbsp; The irony is that for all of the Burger King concern about rising meat prices, the cost of a pound of 80% lean ground beef was unchanged in July from the previous month.&amp;nbsp; The less than delicious part was the taste in my mouth when I realized that I not only have to now concern myself with cavities, but also splinters.
As to the PracticalDad Price Index, the Total Index of the 47 item market basket actually declined slightly to 110.2 from June&#39;s 110.53 (November 2010 = 100) so that the total price of the market basket of grocery and related items was 10.2% higher than in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; When the ten non&#45;food items (soap, aluminum foil, etc) are removed so that 37 core food items remain, that 37 item Food&#45;Only Index actually rose to 113.22 from June&#39;s 112.65 (November 2010 = 100) so that the cumulative price of the 37 items has risen 13.22% since November 2010.&amp;nbsp;
The big movers in previous months &#45; meat and dairy &#45; were essentially flat with only a minor rise in the cost of a pound of hot dogs and pound of chicken with the cost of ground beef unchanged.&amp;nbsp; The big increases this month were in wheat based products &#45; specifically hot dog rolls and spaghetti &#45; as one of the three grocery retailers jacked prices on those items by 29% from the previous month.&amp;nbsp; Note that this retailer, which has had some profitability issues, unilaterally cut prices on specific core items as part of a program to show their customers that they were passing along savings; this was not a one or two week sale, or even a two month sale but instead a program that actually changed the unit price labelling on the shelves for an extended period of time.&amp;nbsp; Well, that program ended and the prices for some of these items are now rejoining their brethren amongst the other stores.
The point to take from this is not that one retailer was masking the issue, but instead that the issue of inflation is a conflict between monetary policy (commodity prices such as sugar, aluminum and et cetera), supply&#45;demand issues (dairy and meat) and actual deflation due to the economic weakness of the end consumer, who is watching his/her income continually decline.&amp;nbsp; This particular retailer has had issues related to profitability and has had to take measures to shore up the customer base and provide competition based upon price instead of other factors.
The story about Burger King is one more brick in the mental wall that I&#39;m building against corporations.&amp;nbsp; The ostensible line is that they&#39;re just trying to keep prices down for the end&#45;consumer but the real question for me is when the addition of the cellulose extender began, because the recent rise in meat prices is relatively recent and probably post&#45;dates the cellulose usage.
And here&#39;s the update for July and previous months.

<title>Traveling With the Kids:&nbsp; IG2BTK Tour 2014</title>
<body>IG2BTK.
It&#39;s Good to Be The King.
The site&#39;s been silent recently since we just returned yesterday from a two week trip to Europe &#45; Paris, London and Edinburgh &#45; which was dubbed the It&#39;s Good to Be The King 2014&amp;nbsp;tour.&amp;nbsp; This is the follow&#45;up to the family&#39;s 2011 European Collapse tour (here and here).&amp;nbsp; Just as I found that traveling with children changes as they age, it continues to change as they work their way through the teen years (Eldest is no longer a teen and Youngest might as well be for what it&#39;s worth).&amp;nbsp; I clearly remember when traveling with kids meant assuring that there were sufficient diapers and plenty of activities planned to make the physical aspect of traveling easier for the youngsters.&amp;nbsp; But that&#39;s progressed and while I love traveling with the family, there are moments when the changes are jarring.&amp;nbsp;
So what&#39;s worth noting with the teens and nascent adult?

    Make sure that the kids understand that if breakfast is included in the cost of the room, then they&#39;d better take advantage of the &amp;quot;free food&amp;quot; instead of sleeping in and then looking for a lunch because they&#39;re hungry.&amp;nbsp; For that matter, make sure that the kids understand the difference between a continental breakfast &#45; the serve yourself available at places such as Hampton Inn &#45; and what is referred to as an english breakfast, which is prepared by a cook and brought by staff for an additional charge.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, keep water bottles refilled so that you don&#39;t have to spend money needlessly on water.
    Make sure that they understand that they are clearly prey for any number of grifters and beggars.&amp;nbsp; Paris was loaded with gypsies at public sites who approached with request for petition signatures; the catch was that if you signed the petition, you&#39;d receive small useless token as thanks and a demand for money to pay for said token.&amp;nbsp; I first learned this schtick in New York City last year after signing a petition for some Buddhist about his temple.&amp;nbsp; He gave me some meaningless fabric flower petal and demanded $20 and when I refused, it got...unpleasant.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fortunate that my paternal male line has a recessive asshole gene for such moments.&amp;nbsp; The kids learned to simply repeat no and keep on walking.
    Press personal security.&amp;nbsp; Men&#39;s wallets should be shifted to the front pocket and women&#39;s purses should be held with the strap over the shoulder and the zipper compartment secured.&amp;nbsp; Since I carry a backpack during the travels, I kept it slung over the shoulder with the zippers secured towards the front so that they were near the hand grasping the strap in order to thwart anyone who might try to unzip it from the rear.
    Make sure that the kids know what to expect from the weather and can pack accordingly, and likewise for any special events planned that might require better dress.&amp;nbsp; Since the last stop on the tour was Edinburgh, Scotland, I checked the expected weather in advance and found that the mid&#45;June averages were a full 20 degrees less than here, akin to a mid&#45;Spring day instead of summer.&amp;nbsp; Also decide whether you trust them to pack without a physical luggage check or if you just want to run through a checklist prior to departure.&amp;nbsp; The kids are old enough now that if they choose to ignore common sense in clothing choices, they can suffer well if they&#39;re chilly.&amp;nbsp;
    Expect moments of cognitive dissonance since the kids are now growing and are capable of far more than they were younger.&amp;nbsp; This was personally the case with Eldest, who is well into college and could legally order alcohol at meals.&amp;nbsp; Our traveling philosophy is that the kids should experience the local culture as much as possible but within the bounds of legality and this especially goes to the issue of alcohol.&amp;nbsp; What is the legal drinking age where you&#39;re at?&amp;nbsp; It was 16 in Italy, so Eldest could have an occasional beer or wine at dinner during the Collapse tour in 2011 while Middle could only share ours.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s 18 in France, England and Scotland and the wait staff throughout was assiduous in carding, so Eldest could again order at dinner &#45; and not occasionally &#45; while Middle was again stuck sharing ours.&amp;nbsp; My only caveat with Eldest was that she have something that wasn&#39;t usually available here so if you&#39;re going to have a beer, make sure that it isn&#39;t a Budweiser.&amp;nbsp; The dissonance also struck in handling the processes since Eldest was much quicker in figuring out the Paris metrocard machines than I was, leading to an apology to her for being brusque because I couldn&#39;t believe that she had it down quicker than me.
    Security goes beyond the physical and to the cyber aspect as well.&amp;nbsp; Kids should be aware that while they can certainly share with their friends, such a prolonged trip isn&#39;t something to be announced via Facebook or another social networking platform where literally anybody &#45; and if the kid has more than 500 &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot;, it&#39;s anybody &#45; can see that the house is wide open for pillaging and/or epic parties.&amp;nbsp;
    Use any opportunity available for teaching the kids, whether it&#39;s about politics, economics, history or simply life.&amp;nbsp; Our accommodations in London were a classic mix of the sixth level of Dante&#39;s Inferno and John Cleese&#39;s Fawlty Towers and as satisfying as yelling would be, I was cognizant that the kids were watching.&amp;nbsp; So the lessons were twofold:&amp;nbsp; first, that the person in front of you is liable to not be the person responsible for your dilemma so yelling is probably harmful since you become the enemy instead of the wronged customer; second, that you need to have a plan and know what you actually want when you find that one responsible party. Talk about the situation and pick it apart with the kids, and then share the results of any actions or conversations with them.&amp;nbsp; In other words, plan, execute and then do a post&#45;mortem on the situation.&amp;nbsp;
    Teach the kids to double&#45;check that what they&#39;ve purchased is actually what&#39;s wrapped up by the sales staff.&amp;nbsp; Twice this trip, my wife and I found that items that we thought we were purchasing weren&#39;t what actually came out of the package.&amp;nbsp; My wife was more upset since she was purchasing silk scarf whereas I was bringing home a bottle of scottish whiskey and cream.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll certainly see through my disappointment, but it might not be as easy for a ten&#45;year old who had her heart set on a special something.

One of our principal family values is the exposure to other cultures and we&#39;ll continue to travel as the opportunities arise &#45; or we make them.&amp;nbsp; But all things change and the nature of the family vacation does as well with the aging and maturing of the kids.&amp;nbsp; Carpe diem.

<title>The Site&#8230;</title>
<body>Since this site started, I&#39;ve managed to put out hundreds of articles at a fairly steady pace &#45; although it has declined in the past several months due to family demands.&amp;nbsp; Life is going to again intrude on the writing and the site will be silent for a few weeks.&amp;nbsp; Still here since I&#39;ve managed to renew the domain name without screwing that up, but the new articles will be quiet.
But things will flow again in a few weeks and I hope that you will continue reading.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for reading the articles and putting me on the RSS feed, which is about the only metric to which I pay attention.
It is greatly appreciated.

<title>Conversation with the Teen:&nbsp; Is the American Middle Class Dead?</title>
<body>You know that a concept has hit the mainstream when high school social studies teachers raise it in class.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case with the apparently imminent death of the American Middle Class, a topic that was raised by Middle&#39;s honors history teacher the other week.&amp;nbsp; This teacher is a known and highly respected quantity since Eldest made it a point to tell Middle that he had to get this guy if at all possible since he makes it a point to riff on the subject matter with topics of modern consequence.&amp;nbsp; As he discussed the industrialization of the Far East, he shifted the topic over to the problems facing today&#39;s American Middle Class and it was a topic that Middle brought home in a later conversation.
What Middle, and most, know is that the American Middle Class is suffering from a significant income drop over the past decade due to a true paucity of jobs.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s aware that many of the jobs now created are of the lower paying, benefit&#45;free variety in the service sector so that the typical American that loses a decent survivable wage job can replace it with a lower paying job.&amp;nbsp; The first whammy is the loss of income and the second whammy is the new need to suddenly pay for previously &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; benefits that had been covered by the former employer such as health insurance.&amp;nbsp; Okay, you not only now have less but you have new and unexpected uses for that decreased income...When the news hit that millions of health insurance policies were being cancelled and the former policyholders were being forced to go to the market via the 1929 Obamacare Flivver (with a rumble seat), we had to explain that the cancellations were actually expected since the old policies were non&#45;compliant with the new health insurance feature. Reissuing new ones with the required features, available to anyone now, would cause new policies with wholly new pricing.&amp;nbsp; Lesser income, likelihood of more variant hours worked and a new category for the money than what was faced by the parents are huge stressors.
So the middle class is under assault but like the refrain from the old Monty Python skit goes, I&#39;m not dead yet...</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - June 2014 - Prices Up (But Due to Supply, Not the Fed&#8230;)</title>
<body>The results of the June 2014 PracticalDad Price Index are in and it tracks with what we&#39;re seeing in the media as prices are up again, driven by increases in dairy and meat prices.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index for the 47 item grocery marketbasket rose from May&#39;s 109.85 (November 2010 = 100) to June&#39;s 110.53.&amp;nbsp; Removing the ten non&#45;food items in the basket (see the basket composition here), the Food&#45;Only Index for the remaining 37 foodstuff items rose significantly from May&#39;s 111.54 (November 2010 = 100) to June&#39;s 112.65.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the price of the representative foodstuffs in the basket are up 12.65% since November 2010&#39;s Index inception but the Food&#45;Only Index is still well below the high of 114.33 reached in December 2012.
There appears to be a significant difference between the reasons for the recent and prior price increases however.&amp;nbsp; In late 2012, there were significant increases in the prices of commodity items such as canola oil (affected by oil prices and the offsetting rise in biofuel demand), sugar and coffee due to the apparent flow of hot money liquidity caused by the existant quantitative easing process.&amp;nbsp; But since then, the Federal Reserve has step&#45;decreased the quantitative easing to approximately $45 Billion per month so that the money isn&#39;t flowing as readily as it did previously.&amp;nbsp; When the Food&#45;Only Index peaked in December 2012 at 114.33 (14.33% over the November 2010 start), the average cost of a 48 ounce bottle of canola oil was $4.09 and the cost of a five pound bag of sugar was $3.49.&amp;nbsp; As of June 2014 however, the cost of the same size bottle of canola oil is $3.96 and the adjusted cost of a bag of sugar is $2.82; note that the sugar has been adjusted upwards to a five pound bag size since the grocers and producers have decreased the standard size bag of sugar via stealth inflation to a four pound bag.&amp;nbsp; The unadjusted price of a bag of sugar is even less now.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the same for coffee.&amp;nbsp; Even though the producers utilized stealth inflation packaging changes to decrease the size of the standard can from 13 ounces to anywhere between 11 and 11.5 ounces, the adjusted cost of the can of coffee (back to a 13 ounce equivalence) is now averaging $3.30.&amp;nbsp; This is down from the December 2012 can price of $4.47, for a decrease of 26% over the same 18 month period.&amp;nbsp; Again, the hot money has receded...
But why the renewed price increases now?&amp;nbsp; After the December 2012 peak, the Indices actually began to decline and you could watch the ongoing combat between the Fed policies and deflationary forces caused by a weakened economy.&amp;nbsp; But the uptick began again recently and this time is due not to monetary policies but to actual forces of supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; In the past year, the size of the national cattle herds have actually dropped to lows not seen since 1952 and drought out west is worsening, affecting the food and dairy supply out of that region.&amp;nbsp; Beef has since increased in the cost per pound as well as dairy and cheese prices; also on the cusp is the effect of PEDV &#45; Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus &#45; which has caused hog farmers to cull herds with affected swine.&amp;nbsp; This disease began in the US in mid 2013 and has spread with an impact on the cost of bacon and ham.&amp;nbsp; While I do not track the cost of bacon, a pound of sliced cooked deli ham has risen from $4.83 in December 2012 to $6.32 in June 2014 for an increase of almost 31% in an 18 month period.
This is clearly beyond the purview of the Fed policies and it probably makes some within the bowels of the Marriner Eccles Building happy since it accomplishes what they wanted in the first place.&amp;nbsp; The only problem is that these price issues are beyond the immediate remedy of the Powers That Be and compound the impact of a decreasing family income.

<title>A Prophet In His Own Land</title>
<body>There are times when it&#39;s better for the kids to hear it from another adult since repeated commentary in the household smacks of the prophet in his own land deal, just more nonsense spewing out of the old man&#39;s mouth.&amp;nbsp; Today was one of those rare occasions when one of the kids got to hear it full bore from another parent, even if that kid was Eldest, the college student who actually gets it.
She&#39;s home on summer break and joined me at the grocery store.&amp;nbsp; Our cashier at the checkout line was a mother of two that had, at one time, gone to our church.&amp;nbsp; Her kids are of similar ages to Eldest and Middle and as we transacted business, I inquired as to their whereabouts.&amp;nbsp; The discussion was fascinating because it encapsulated both what I&#39;ve been saying to my kids for years as well as providing a snapshot of larger economic issues.&amp;nbsp; Neither of her kids are now in school, although her eldest had spent a year in college before transferring elsewhere and ultimately dropping out.&amp;nbsp; There was significant discord in her household as she and her husband refused to take out a PLUS loan or co&#45;sign for any loans that he might take on himself, leading him to withdraw for now.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t that they didn&#39;t want to; but both Mom and Dad recognized that the old college model &#45; the best seven years of my life &#45; are gone.&amp;nbsp; The boy wasn&#39;t deadly serious about it and uncertain as to what he wanted; topping it off was that Dad had lost his own job and their own finances were shaky although they at least owned their home free and clear.&amp;nbsp; The unhappy conclusion for their Eldest was that he would find a job and pay off his existing student debt while he figured out his next step.&amp;nbsp; The cashier&#39;s daughter is graduating in a week but has decided, despite straight A&#39;s and a stellar athletic stint, that she&#39;d rather work for now while she figured out her next steps.
What came through in the conversation, as Eldest listened, were several points.&amp;nbsp; First, that there really is a shortage of livable wage jobs out there for young adults as this woman&#39;s kids are struggling to find adequate employment.&amp;nbsp; Second, that the student loans really are a deadweight on household formation, a cornerstone of viable economic growth; she commented that her kids, and others that she knew, were having difficulty pulling together the down payment for a used car, let alone for a house.&amp;nbsp; This is borne out by the recent Zerohedge/Pew Research article showing that the average net worth of a college graduate with student debt is a full 20% less than an unindebted high school graduate of the same age.&amp;nbsp; As she pointed out to Eldest, her wish &#45; and mine as well &#45; was that the adult kids would come for Sunday dinner and visits, not every breakfast without fail.&amp;nbsp; My contribution to the conversation was the third point, one that Eldest has heard me make before:&amp;nbsp; if an average young person&#39;s lifespan is expected to surpass 80 years, does it make sense to take on the debt now instead of growing a bit and letting the post&#45;high school smoke clear?&amp;nbsp; Make sure that there&#39;s a plan for college, otherwise take some time to get your life in order before incurring the cost.
Eldest clearly wants to be out in the great wide world on her own.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s smart and in the past several weeks that she&#39;s been home, I&#39;ve noted thought processes that were dormant in earlier years and some of these go to standing on her own two feet.&amp;nbsp; She didn&#39;t say much in the conversation with the cashier acquaintance but I could tell that the persistent home meme about student debt had paid off, leaving her with the prospect of doing what she wants when college is through.&amp;nbsp; Setting up her own place and moving out into the great wide world.
Now I have to keep talking to her younger siblings.&amp;nbsp;

<title>So, What Did You Learn?</title>
<body>There are moments when it&#39;s entirely appropriate to rain fire and brimstone upon a kid or teen for behavior or stupidity, and there are other moments when it&#39;s unnecessary because they&#39;re raining it upon themselves.&amp;nbsp; This typically happens in competitive situations when an error causes points to score and it&#39;s especially likely &#45; for many kids &#45; when it involves a team sport and the letdown affects teammates as well. There are parents out there who will willingly take the kid to task for the error but it is, in most cases, needless and unnecessarily painful because any worthwhile kid is beating himself up for all of them.
Such was the case this entire baseball season for Youngest, whose team is providing ample opportunities for what can best be described as &amp;quot;character&#45;building lessons&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Decent pitching and hitting is wholly overwhelmed by poor fielding and a complete lack of understanding on what to do with that round white thing when it&#39;s hit into the field.&amp;nbsp; Dropped balls are treated as dead plays when they are actually as live as a hand grenade and easy outs are wrapped in tinsel and handed to the other teams as tickets that can be exchanged by opposing teams for more and more runs.&amp;nbsp; Once that truck starts moving downhill, then it&#39;s difficult to stop and eventually everybody climbs aboard as almost everything degrades.
With multiple kids, other responsibilities and two parents, it&#39;s problematic getting to everything and I missed seeing a recent Saturday afternoon game.&amp;nbsp; But I heard about it in glorious, gory detail in the kitchen as Youngest related one particular play in which he was involved and which allowed the winning run to score in the last inning.&amp;nbsp; I could hear the embarrassment in his voice and even though it takes more than one person to make up a team, he blamed himself.&amp;nbsp;
So what&#39;s the best approach?&amp;nbsp; Do I look for the bright side in every little thing and minimize the particular play?&amp;nbsp; Or do I lose my cool and hammer the kid?&amp;nbsp; God knows that I&#39;ve heard plenty of parents through the years hammer their kids for a mistake.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s ultimately no way to put lipstick on the pig so after hearing the story, I opted to simply stop preparing dinner and ask so what did you learn from this?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s your lesson?&amp;nbsp; And after stopping for a moment, he simply responded I have to know where the play is going to be made. &amp;nbsp;
A similar scenario played out with Middle in an after&#45;school conversation the other day.&amp;nbsp; He has a teacher whose reputation is that he&#39;ll challenge the kids and he apparently lives up to it, based upon what I hear.&amp;nbsp; In class, the teacher posed an analogy for the Ottoman Empire with a $5 payoff to anyone who could get it right.&amp;nbsp; Multiple kids took the stab and failed and Middle mouthed an answer to a neighbor, who then claimed it publicly as his own.&amp;nbsp; It was also the correct answer and the neighbor took home $5.&amp;nbsp; When Middle approached the teacher after class, he admitted that he&#39;d seen Middle mouthing the answer to the other kid yet did nothing when it was claimed...so what did you learn from this? &amp;nbsp;I inquired.&amp;nbsp; Middle shook his head and acknowledged that he might as well take the shot at an answer, at a minimum.&amp;nbsp; I agreed and noted that the teacher was also explicitly teaching him &#45; Middle &#45; a lesson that is invaluable even if it doesn&#39;t come from a book.
Our job as fathers and parents is to prepare them for life, to help them learn to think for themselves and stand on their own and that&#39;s not going to happen if we don&#39;t stop and make them think.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve even walked through my own screwups and laid out the lessons that I should take from the situation, what my own father referred to as the Post Mortem.&amp;nbsp; Giving them pep talks or dressing them down simply isn&#39;t of much value unless they actually learn the lesson that should flow from their growing experiences.

<title>The College Food Bank</title>
<body>It&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve written on the college debt issue although the topic has certainly had play within the household as Eldest continues her way through college and Middle starts to examine options.&amp;nbsp; But while inured to the issue, I was appalled to find that the local state university&#39;s Student Christian organization now runs a food bank for students so that they have something to eat.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because in an effort to get through with as little debt as possible, students are cutting out the student meal plan and getting by on what they can cadge.
This particular food bank is not officially sanctioned by the university as any approved student organization but is indeed one of the multiple services offered by the campus student christian organization.&amp;nbsp; It has a paid chaplain whose salary is covered by the local ministerium of churches but no other staff and it&#39;s office is located in a university provided building.&amp;nbsp; The need was noticed a very few years ago by the chaplain when he found that some students were simply going without and then hitting events in order to feed themselves.&amp;nbsp; Now the notion of college students living on ramen isn&#39;t new and even I had friends and acquaintances eating cheap hot dogs, spaghetti and ramen in college; but what&#39;s different is now that these students can&#39;t even afford the cheapest food and are simply doing without in entirety.&amp;nbsp; When I spoke with my own pastor, who sits on that group&#39;s board and informed me of the bank&#39;s existence, she stated that what they were handing out were single serving items such as instant soup or single serving mac/cheese which were easy to fix when there are minimal kitchen facilities.&amp;nbsp; The kids aren&#39;t cutting out the niceties to go to the basics, they&#39;re being forced to cut out the basics in the entirety.
There&#39;s now a fundamental disconnect in our society.&amp;nbsp; We sell the importance of a college education and many kids take it to heart, yet we saddle them with crippling debt and a barista job at Starbucks.&amp;nbsp; Now that they&#39;re getting the disconnect, they&#39;re doing everything that they can &#45; unhealthy as it is &#45; to still get the degree.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s time to rethink higher education and put our money where our mouth is...because God knows that more than a few kids aren&#39;t putting anything in their mouths.

<body>Although this is being posted later than would normally happen, the pricing for the May 2014 PracticalDad Price Index occurred at the first of the month and the results were simply unexpected.&amp;nbsp; For all of the talk about incipient inflation &#45; given credence by April 2014&#39;s jump in the 37 item Food&#45;Only Segment Index by greater than 1.5 points &#45; the battle between Fed desired inflation and deflation continues as both of the indices declined again; this was led by Food&#45;Only Segment Index literal collapse of greater than 2 points from April&#39;s 113.59 to May&#39;s 111.54 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The results are listed below:
&amp;nbsp;

    PracticalDad Price Index &#45; May 2014


            Month
            Total Index (11/10 = 100)
            Food&#45;Only Index (11/10 = 100)
            Spread


            2/14
            109.64
            112.46
            2.82


            3/14
            109.41
            112.06
            2.65


            4/14
            110.28
            113.59
            3.31


            5/14
            109.85
            111.54

            1.69




&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Most notable about this result is the sheer size of the index swing downwards &#45; more than 2 full index points &#45; and especially on the heels of the largest upward swing of 1.53 full points in the previous month.&amp;nbsp; If the marketbasket were a machine, I&#39;d swear that the vibrations were increasing in such a manner as to damage it.
So for all of the talk about inflation, why the sharp move downwards?&amp;nbsp; Remember that deflation is symptomatic of a decline in the money supply as well as incomes and if the money supply is at all time highs, then prices are declining because the producers/retailers are having to drop them to help maintain sales; the Great Depression of 1929 was a situation in which businesses lost all control of their pricing because of a collapse in jobs and income.&amp;nbsp;
In May 2014, the index decline was again due to the price decreases in multiple food items at one store.&amp;nbsp; This same store has had greater than a half dozen food item price cuts since January 2014 and an additional three food items saw price declines as of the May pricing excursions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Let&#39;s put this in perspective.&amp;nbsp; The PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket is composed of 47 common grocery store items, of which 37 are foodstuff products (for a complete list of the items in the marketbasket, see here).&amp;nbsp; Of the three constituent stores surveyed, one store has had price cuts in ten separate foodstuff products from the Index &#45; more than a quarter of the food items &#45; in the past five months.
There were certainly price increases in meat and dairy products as the cost of milk rose and the effects of the national beef herd culling rolls through to the consumer, but these factors were more than offset by the efforts of a grocer to stay afloat amidst a customer base that is cutting back spending because it&#39;s being starved of income in the bifurcated American economy.

I&#39;m waiting to see if and when this trend starts to hit the other two grocers.

<title>An Abiding State of PACE</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
Perhaps it should say long&#45;leggedy teenagers, instead.&amp;nbsp;
Ask any middle&#45;aged parent about teenagers and the response is liable to be an audible sigh accompanied by a visible shaking and dropping of the head.&amp;nbsp; They are capable of things that are utterly breathtaking to the parents &#45; where in the hell did that come from? &#45;&amp;nbsp;to be immediately followed by an equally breathtaking lapse of the most basic common sense.&amp;nbsp; As I pause on the threshold of having three kids within the teen pipeline, Youngest on the verge of entering and Eldest on the verge of exiting with Middle in the...middle, it occurred that I exist in a perpetual and abiding state of PACE (Perpetual Annoyance and Chronic Exasperation), far different from what I recall during their early years when it was a given that the onus of most personal care and thinking fell upon me instead of them. &amp;nbsp;
It was easy to remember when they were tykes that the burden fell upon me for the majority of their care.&amp;nbsp; But the tykes grow into more adult&#45;sized bodies, albeit often disproportionate with feet and/or hands placed upon the extended limbs that don&#39;t quite mesh the rest of their forms.&amp;nbsp; The result is a sense, and I freely admit unfounded, that this life&#45;size ersatz adult should be able to think with the structure of an adult mind.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to say that I expect them to understand much about the adult American world since most adults don&#39;t seemingly comprehend it either, with it&#39;s opaque financial and cultural structures that defy understanding and increasing security structures that discourage even questioning.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a common recurring misconception of mine, that believes that possessing size 12 feet also confers a degree of common sense when the reality is that the visible body&#39;s size is wholly unrelated to their ability to think and use even a minimal degree of common sense.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, I&#39;d expect that such a possibility would even remotely cross your mind...as my blood pressure increases over the short period of time.
But what happens to the teenage brain over the pubescent teen years is far different.&amp;nbsp; Feet grow and body hair develops, but the child&#39;s brain is doing things that have taken the breath of neuroscientists away.&amp;nbsp; With the development of the MRI and CT&#45;scan machines, someone had the bright idea of doing periodic brain scans for the same children &#45; akin to snapshots &#45; at regular intervals over the course of years.&amp;nbsp; The upshot of these scans was the realization that the brain of the typical kid was literally rewiring itself with new pathways being formed over the course of years.&amp;nbsp; When I first learned this, my response was so when I told her to take out the trash on three different instances, it didn&#39;t happen because the requests were stuck in synaptic construction traffic.&amp;nbsp; This knowledge is a sop to the frustration when clothing is strewn about, milk left and requests/commands ignored; but the accumulation of stuff still drives my blood pressure upwards and leaves me wondering, what else to do?
But for all of the teeth&#45;grinding frustration, there are moments when I realize that despite the haywire thinking processes, the kids are developing character and making choices that reflect a growing awareness of the world and their place within it.&amp;nbsp; This character, and the understanding of the difference between right and wrong, is something that I consider even more important than the developing ability to think.&amp;nbsp; This is the literal framework within which they will think as adults, the lens that focuses their decisions reached after thought, consideration or perhaps the occasional coin toss.&amp;nbsp; Until they&#39;re on their own, all that I can do is try to bite my tongue &#45; or not bite theirs &#45; and hang onto the knowledge that this too shall pass when their brains catch up with the rest of their bodies.&amp;nbsp; The effort until then is to talk with them and try to help them develop the structure with which they can think their way through problems and questions.&amp;nbsp; It should also go without saying that the character work has to continue as well.

<title>The Virus Cocktail</title>
<body>I must be slipping.
This morning saw a quick early morning run to the grocery store for the ingredients of the PracticalDad family virus cocktail, apple juice and Sprite.&amp;nbsp; They are the ingredients that for years,I kept on the basement storage shelves precisely for the moment when I heard the night&#45;time Siren&#39;s call, I&#39;m not feeling well and think that I have to throw up. &amp;nbsp;Which is what my wife and I heard from Youngest in the middle of last night as he entered our room.&amp;nbsp; We both got up with him and after settling him back into bed, I took disinfectant wipes to the touchable surfaces in the kids bathroom; I then settled into the Eldest&#39;s vacant bed in the room next to his in the event that there were other issues.&amp;nbsp;
Each family seems to have its own magic elixir for handling illness and ours is the virus cocktail.&amp;nbsp; We adopted it for multiple reasons, not least of which is an effort to at least keep the sick ones hydrated and away from an emergency room IV drip for dehydration and excepting one occasion amongst three kids, it&#39;s worked.&amp;nbsp; The non&#45;acidic apple juice contains much needed vitamin C to help bolster an ailing immune system and is supplemented by the Sprite so that the antsy stomach isn&#39;t out&#45;and&#45;out assaulted by the juice; when we&#39;re fixing it, we even stir it before delivery to remove the carbonated bubbles so that again, the stomach is spared.&amp;nbsp; The fact that it&#39;s tasty also makes sipping it less of a chore than water, which an ailing kid is likely to look at with an unspoken blecchhhh crossing the face. We also kept a spare bottle of Pedialyte on the shelves to help correct the sick child&#39;s body chemistry but found that the taste was simply unappealing and after a horrendous session years ago, coaxing a sick child to take in some nutrients only to meet them again within 15 minutes, the option was to stick with the cocktail.
When the kids were very small and I knew that my better half was leaving on business, it was a point to assure that we had at least two bottles of each within the house.&amp;nbsp; We seemed to live under a curse that left one or more kids simultaneously &#45; or sequentially &#45; ill with one thing or another and with her gone, any sickness left me housebound to manage until their recovery or her return.&amp;nbsp; Within two days of either, it was a given that I&#39;d be in the same boat as the now&#45;healed children.&amp;nbsp; But as the kids have grown and learned to cope with the illnesses, the practice of stocking for the cocktail has fallen into disuse so that this most recent event left me ill&#45;prepared.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s easier now that the kids are a bit older and not so physically incapable of caring for themselves.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no panic with sickness and a sense of routine &#45; okay, here we go again so just stay to my room, nap and let it run the course &#45; and sure enough, when Eldest was sick the other week in college, my wife received a text announcing the stomach virus with the news that a roommate had already been dispatched to the nearby grocery for...apple juice and Sprite.&amp;nbsp; Eldest then took to her room with her cocktail and let it run the 24 hour course.&amp;nbsp; On the refrigerator door is a note to remind me to pick up the replacement ingredients for the cocktail on my next trip so that I&#39;m not caught unprepared again.
Which reminds me, I need to stock up on more hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.

<title>Surviving Jack:&nbsp; Is There a New Fatherhood Meme Starting?</title>
<body>My wife and I were sitting in the family room watching the evening tube when Fox ran a commercial promoting a new show, Surviving Jack, with Christopher Meloni.&amp;nbsp; After watching Meloni&#39;s character, Jack, in the promo, she looked over at me laughing and simply said you&#39;re going to want to see that.&amp;nbsp; She was correct and when it finally aired about a week later, I did.
Meloni&#39;s character, Jack, is happily married &#45; insofar as that kind of guy experiences happiness &#45; to the mother of his two teenage children in the halcyon days of the early 1990s.&amp;nbsp; He is a physician who steps up to take a larger role in raising the kids when his wife returns to law school, much to the fear and trepidation of his high school freshman son.&amp;nbsp; It is this character who is the present&#45;day narrator of the story and is loosely based upon the upbringing of author and creator Justin Halpern; those who recall the name understand that Jack is also based loosely upon Halpern&#39;s father, who Halpern made famous in his hilarious S*!t My Dad Says.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve watched two episodes of the show and will continue because it&#39;s funny and also because it&#39;s frankly fascinating as to the points that can be made about fatherhood if one chooses to consider them.
The first point is that Jack doesn&#39;t view being an active and engaged parent who&#39;s now responsible for the daily care of teenagers with trepidation.&amp;nbsp; The popular media view of most fathers over the past twenty years has been that they are, at worst, idiots and at best, well&#45;meaning but ineffective in their ability to parent the kids.&amp;nbsp; Granted, Jack&#39;s kids are now teenagers and he&#39;s through the stage where he&#39;s changing diapers and managing the When You Give a Mouse a Cookie chaos of small children.&amp;nbsp; But teens present a wholly different challenge that is, as one mother described to me, far more mental and emotional than the physical of small kids.&amp;nbsp; Jack&#39;s wife is hopeful that he&#39;ll manage but concerned how her hard&#45;nosed husband will handle the challenges; she has to let go of her own desire to micro&#45;manage &#45; and yes, mothers, many of you do tend to micromanage Dad &#45; and trust him.&amp;nbsp; In an early instance of teen nonsense, he simply says don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll handle this and proceeds to do so in a way that is foreign to most women but common to many men.&amp;nbsp; And to her relief and surprise, it works.
This leads to the second point, which is that women and men have a fundamentally different view of not only the role of parenting, but also the goal.&amp;nbsp; Jack&#39;s wife talks to classically self&#45;absorbed teen daughter and tells her that she wants her to avoid the same mistakes that she herself made and be happy.&amp;nbsp; Jack&#39;s vision of what he has to do is prepare the kids to make their way in a world that is competitive and more than a little unfriendly.&amp;nbsp; Happiness is something that comes after a person has shown himself capable of managing what life throws at him and in Jack&#39;s view, the objects thrown include everything up to and including the kitchen sink.&amp;nbsp; When his son is on the mound trying out for a place on the varsity baseball team, he has to pitch to his best friend, who desperately needs to get hits in order to make the team as well.&amp;nbsp; After lobbing a pineapple that goes for a hit, Jack actually interrupts the game and goes to the mound to tell his boy to stop half&#45;assing and pitch the ball.&amp;nbsp; Son gets the message and proceeds to school his friend in the art of baseball.&amp;nbsp; While the circumstances have been different, the term half&#45;assing is one that I&#39;ve actually used with all of my own kids.&amp;nbsp; Son/Daughter/Whoever you are, I will support you in whatever you wish to participate.&amp;nbsp; But if you&#39;re going to try it, then do your best and go all in.&amp;nbsp; Because if I even think that you&#39;re half&#45;assing in there and wasting my time, then that support goes away and you&#39;ll be done.&amp;nbsp; Period. &amp;nbsp;And to the pleasure of my wife and I, each has gone all in and given their best effort.&amp;nbsp; It might not be the best out there, but soccer forwards are chased down, hits run through to first base and music practiced for the garage band to the point that it legitimately sounds good; and when a song sucks, it gets canned from the upcoming show&#39;s playlist.
The third point is that Jack is actually respectful of the structure that his wife has created with the family and stays within it, showing that he&#39;ll uphold his wife and maintain a solid front.&amp;nbsp; When his son, and buddies, come to him for help with their baseball skills, he takes up the challenge in comically over&#45;the&#45;top fashion.&amp;nbsp; He scares them and when his off&#45;screen wife overhears him state that he&#39;ll be picking them up at 5 AM and that they should expect to skip school in order to practice, she steps in and commands that school shall not be missed.&amp;nbsp; Jack&#39;s response isn&#39;t an argument with her, but a simple change of plans so that he respects her stance that school attendance is inviolable.&amp;nbsp; He might offer a different opinion of a situation to his daughter than one rendered by his wife, but again, he maintains a united front.&amp;nbsp;
Will this replacement show last?&amp;nbsp; I have no idea and frankly, my track record on calling the survival of television shows is spotty at best.&amp;nbsp; But despite the broad caricatures drawn by the creator and writers for comedic effect, the upshot of the show is that for all of the quirks, Jack is a blunt, old&#45;school father who is actually an effective parent.&amp;nbsp; He refuses to accept the position of Bucky, the Sidekick Parent that&#39;s taken by the large majority of on&#45;screen fathers.&amp;nbsp; His perspective on fatherhood is to&#45;the&#45;point and survival oriented, as much as that of a father raising kids on the American frontier.&amp;nbsp; Men do have a different perspective on their role than women and it&#39;s honestly time that it&#39;s acknowledged to be as valid as that of the more tender&#45;hearted mother.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - April 2014:&nbsp; Wishing It Was April Fools Day</title>
<body>The pricing for the 47 item PracticalDad Price Index grocery basket took place on April 1 and when I calculated the results, I could only wish that it was actually an April Fool&#39;s experience but alas, it&#39;s not. The Total Index rose by a full .87 points, from March&#39;s 109.41 to 110.28 in April (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; This was powered by the rise in the 37 item food&#45;item portion of the basket, which suffered a one month gain of 1.53 points &#45; equivalent to a single month rise of greater than 1.5% &#45; from March&#39;s 112.06 to April&#39;s 113.59 (again, November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; For our purposes, the cost of a 47 item grocery basket has risen 10.28% since the Index&#39;s inception in November, 2010.&amp;nbsp; For a list of the items that have been monitored monthly since November 2010, see here.&amp;nbsp; When you remove the 10 non&#45;food related items such as aluminum foil and bath soap, the remaining 37 items have risen by 13.59% from November 2010.
Note that the Food&#45;Only Index is still below that Index high reached in December 2012, when it reached it&#39;s high of 114.33.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index, which also comprises the ten non&#45;food items, is continuing to set new highs as time moves forward; but now the food is again the driver.&amp;nbsp;
I was curious as to the results given the late March news that the Commodities Research Bureau Foodstuffs Index has risen 19% since December, 2013. This was especially since the movement of the PracticalDad Food&#45;only Index in the past several months has been downwards and I&#39;ve seen multiple food items actually drop in price over that same time frame.&amp;nbsp; So if the CRB Foodstuff Index is rising while the grocery basket index is flat or declining, what does that mean?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s helpful to understand what each index is and what each measures.&amp;nbsp; The CRB Index has been around for decades and measures 10 agricultural commodities only:&amp;nbsp;

    hogs
    steers
    lard
    butter
    soybean oil
    cocoa
    corn
    Kansas City wheat
    Minneapolis wheat
    sugar

These items are input items into the food system, used frequently by consumers sooner or later, hamburger in the former or as sugar processed for kid&#39;s breakfast cereal in the latter.&amp;nbsp; The commodity foodstuffs are frontloaded in the food pipeline, so to speak.&amp;nbsp; They are influenced by multiple factors.&amp;nbsp;
The PracticalDad Price Index however, is measuring the prices of commonly used foodstuffs at the retail end of the food pipeline.&amp;nbsp; Hamburger and hot dogs, canned and fresh vegetables, common dairy items that we use in our daily cooking and food consumption.&amp;nbsp; While I haven&#39;t done any real examination, it would appear that there&#39;s a general lag of several months in the food pipeline and the behavior of the PracticalDad Index is basically lagging the CRB Index.
So what&#39;s the takeaway here?

    That the PracticalDad increase is only the first of further to come as the CRB commodity increases work their way through the food production and delivery pipeline.
    That while the commodity increases might be outsized, they&#39;ll be somewhat contained &#45; although still exceptionally painful to a population in which over 47 million are on food&#45;assistance &#45; since the market basket is composed of other items as well.&amp;nbsp; But on the whole, this is still a bad, bad thing.
    Expect that as weather and drought related conditions exist, there won&#39;t be a significant improvement unless demand for some of the foodstuffs decreases as to force producers to control prices and accept a lower profit margin...and good luck on that one.

And one other note about this.&amp;nbsp; The commodity inputs now are largely weather/drought related, and I&#39;ve seen significant increases in the dairy segment of the PracticalDad Index; as the weather changes and herd sizes increase and crop production increase, the commodity prices will drop &#45; as they did for example, in mid &#45; 2011.&amp;nbsp; Will these decreases also feed through to simple price declines in the grocery store?

<title>Something Wicked This Way Comes: Kids and Dystopian Lit</title>
<body>As I write this, the latest wave of dystopian young adult lit, Hunger Games:&amp;nbsp; Catching Fire and Divergent, are respectively on Demand and in the theatres.&amp;nbsp; Dystopian  is a word that means, as I explained to Youngest the other morning, the opposite of Utopian; it pertains to a situation or circumstance that is dysfunctional, dark and bleak.&amp;nbsp; The genre is nothing new as it offers an opportunity for society to fictionally work through the dark fears and nightmares that concern us.&amp;nbsp; This might be the long&#45;term effects of radiation that framed some of the better sci&#45;fi movies of the 1950s or the soulless impact of the corporate/big&#45;brother world of the Matrix movies.&amp;nbsp; Even young adult fiction has had its dystopian elements, but the latest incarnations &#45; coupled with conversation with my own kids &#45; has me wondering what exactly is going on.
Youngest&#39;s reading interests have always been a bit different.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s never taken to the Harry Potter books like his siblings but he&#39;s become steeped in Greek and Roman mythologies, with all of the earliest stories of heroism and character failings.&amp;nbsp; He likewise has taken to young adventure and is an avid fan of Anthony Horowitz&#39; Alex Rider as well as The Young Bond series by Charlie Higson.&amp;nbsp; These are classic examples of the good/evil adventure stories with heroes and villains, except that the heroes are in their mid&#45;teens and infinitely more identifiable to the reader.&amp;nbsp; But several months ago, he began reading another series by Charlie Higson, The Enemy.&amp;nbsp; The premise centers on the lives of young London tweens and teens trying to survive in the midst of a global zombie apocalyse and each of the books examines the separate lives and adventures of specific characters; the characters &#45; those who manage to survive &#45; don&#39;t meet until one of the later books in the series and it&#39;s this book in which he&#39;s presently immersed.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s different about this particular series however, lies in the seeming hopelessness of the struggles that these kids undergo.&amp;nbsp; Youngest came down to breakfast one morning recently and shook his head as we talked about this particular series.&amp;nbsp; What was brutal for him was that the author would develop young characters with whom he could identify and appreciate, only to have the characters either die or become infected and become zombies; I really get to like somebody and then *bang* he&#39;s gone.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been rare that I&#39;ve censored a kid&#39;s reading choice, typically opting instead to keep tabs on it and perhaps looking to follow up in later conversation about the topic and that&#39;s the route I opted to take in this instance as well.&amp;nbsp; I was then relieved when he put the novel aside for a break: but that was shortlived as he substituted another for it, Divided We Fall.&amp;nbsp; This particular novel is a teen political/action thriller that tells the story of a high&#45;schooler/Idaho National Guardsman who is caught in a blossoming conflict that has the seed of a second Civil War.
It&#39;s the nature of the dystopia that gives me pause.&amp;nbsp; Youth literature has been filled with dystopic themes for many years but it&#39;s only been in the past few that the shift has seemingly gone from the fantastic &#45; Harry Potter and the Twilight series &#45; to the more realistic political and social realms.&amp;nbsp; While the rap on the youngsters is that they don&#39;t pay attention, the reality is that they do pay attention; unfortunately, few adults are actually explaining things to them and they consequently suffer from a deficit of both information and the context into which to put that information.&amp;nbsp; Enough teens are seeing their older siblings and friends return home or scrounge by with considerable debt to understand that things are not going well.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, they are also learning that their electronic tethers are increasingly monitored by the government that has professed to be their lifetime bud; unfortuntately, that bud is in the process of becoming a confidant as well, whether they wish to share the information or not.&amp;nbsp; Couple this with the rise of the corporate society &#45; where they aren&#39;t so much a generation as a marketing cohort &#45; and the 1984 parallels are unnerving, if not downright frightening.
The title of the essay, Some thing Wicked This Way Comes, is a classic Ray Bradbury novel that came out when I was a toddler and which I gobbled up in the entirety in middle school.&amp;nbsp; In the story, the protagonists are young teen boys who must face a terrifying experience that is first portended in quiet, unnerving ways.&amp;nbsp; Bradbury does a great job evoking an atmosphere of growing uneasiness amidst the promise of garish, carnival&#45;like entertainment long before things spin out of control and it&#39;s this same scenario playing out amongst the kids long before they actually have a sense of what&#39;s facing them. They are surrounded by any number of escapist opportunities via an electronics consumer society, yet they sense that events are coalescing in ways that they can&#39;t immediately understand and it&#39;s this sensibility that is spinning out of the minds of authors for the kids&#39; consumption.
Today&#39;s stories are a reflection of the fears that face our future adults.&amp;nbsp; Their problem is that many don&#39;t understand the context of the situations facing our society today and without that understanding, they can&#39;t frame a coherent response to it.&amp;nbsp; So when you see the tweens and teens reading some of this dystopian literature, consider whether they like it because it&#39;s just a &amp;quot;ripping good yarn&amp;quot; or whether there&#39;s a nugget of something else occurring.&amp;nbsp; Then take the time to chat with them and see what you can help comb out of their concerns, putting the story into context.&amp;nbsp; You have the benefit of age, experience and hindsight to help put things in context, while some they might only have a vague uneasiness about what they hear and see.&amp;nbsp; That is, ultimately, our principal job &#45; to teach them, help them make sense of the world so that they&#39;re prepared for it when they step out into it.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index/March 2014:&nbsp; Presenting Stealth Deflation&#8230;</title>
<body>It&#39;s a bit later getting the results out than I prefer, but the data has been crunched for the March 2014 edition of the 47 item (37 foodstuff/10 non&#45;foodstuff) PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket and the results show a continuing deflation.&amp;nbsp; The Total Index of the full 47 item basket dropped from February&#39;s 109.64 to 109.41 while the Food&#45;Only Index of the 37 items likewise dropped from February&#39;s 112.46 to 112.06 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that it cost 9.41% more to purchase the same 47 item marketbasket in March 2014 than it did at the Index&#39;s outset in November 2010; for the foodstuff segment, the cost is 12.06% more than November 2010.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;Only Index is still below the high mark of 114.33, reached in December 2012.
The marketbasket certainly captured the rise in dairy prices as butter, 2% milk and sliced deli cheese (American) all rose; these three were fully half of the six items that had price rises from February 2014.&amp;nbsp; The rises however, were offset by price decreases in eight other items and as occurred in February 2014,  one of the three separate grocery stores saw multiple items with price decreases (versus a rise in butter, a dairy product).&amp;nbsp; Along with other price decreases in other stores, the differential was sufficient to drive the average cost of multiple items downwards.
Many in the past several years have become familiar with the term stealth inflation, which refers to the producer&#39;s practice of maintaining the nominal price for an item while decreasing the package size; the net effect is a real increase in price for the item and the maintenance of the producer&#39;s profit margin.&amp;nbsp; There have certainly been drops in the prices of different items, in different stores, since the Index&#39;s November 2010 inception but there have been a noticeable spate in the past three months, most especially within a particular grocery store.&amp;nbsp; Some are cyclical &#45; milk and eggs are a prime example as their prices yo&#45;yo &#45; but after December 2012, I noticed that prices in fairly common foodstuffs have begun dropping, especially in the one grocery store.&amp;nbsp; I frankly believe that this is because their usual shoppers are in lower&#45;income brackets that have been particularly hard hit in the past several years and the store is having to find ways to decrease their pricing in order to maintain a sufficient sales volume that allows them to survive.&amp;nbsp; This is in addition to other stores which are also having some price decreases (mixed in with the increases).
But what we&#39;re now beginning to see is what I&#39;ve come to refer to as stealth deflation.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s doppleganger, stealth inflation, maintains nominal prices by sacrificing the physical quantity, stealth deflation cuts nominal pricing by sacrificing the physical quality of the foodstuff.&amp;nbsp; To get a handle on this, consider the price decreases in certain items over the past three months (remember that the prices are for items at one or another particular store so the percentage drop is more pronounced here and less pronounced in the final three&#45;store average).
Item&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1/14&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2/14&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3/14&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; %

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; sugar flakes
An example that caught my eye &#45; and required that I actually revisit the store in order to double&#45;check &#45; was the 28% drop in the cost of a can of tuna at one store.&amp;nbsp; The confusion resulted from the fact that there was now a store&#45;brand can of tuna (5 oz) at the old price of $1.39 per as well as a can of 5 oz store&#45;brand tuna at the new and reduced price of $1.00; which was the correct can for the index?&amp;nbsp; The difference was that the reduced price can was still labeled the chunk light tuna, which was the type that I&#39;ve priced across all three stores since November 2010 and the same&#45;priced can was now labeled as solid tuna.&amp;nbsp; I can&#39;t tell you the exact difference between the two but a reasonable surmise is that the lower priced chunk tuna is now composed of different parts or remains of the tuna, which would go for less money than the higher priced tuna.&amp;nbsp; In other words, a decreased quality in comparison than was used before.&amp;nbsp; The same would go for the loaf of bread, peanut butter and certainly store&#45;brand sugar flakes as the product is now coming from a producer with a cheaper, ostensibly lower grade set of ingredients than was available before.
So what&#39;s the upshot of stealth deflation and what does it really mean?&amp;nbsp; The consumer&#39;s purchasing power is being eaten away by a declining income on one side and a purposeful monetary policy that promotes inflation on the other.&amp;nbsp; In order to maintain sales volume and affordability, producers will also engage in stealth deflation by decreasing prices at the cost of ingredient quality.&amp;nbsp; The controversy over pink slime in ground beef is a prime case of the effects of stealth deflation; the additive acted as an extender to the product, allowing the ground beef to be sold at a lesser price than it would have otherwise and when the slime was removed, the cost of ground beef rose.
If parents are truly concerned over what goes into their kids&#39; bodies, then they&#39;re going to have to pay much greater attention.&amp;nbsp; On the one side, to ingredients and inputs, and on the other to entire meal planning and food selection in order to make the budget extend further than it has had to in the past.&amp;nbsp;
Welcome to the future.</body>

<title>Volunteering:&nbsp; When Did I Become That Cub Scout Guy?</title>
<body>There was a recent article which statistically highlighted something that I, like many other involved fathers, have anecdotally noticed.&amp;nbsp; The number of parents who are willing to volunteer is declining and those of us who participate are being stretched increasingly thin.&amp;nbsp; The result is that we&#39;re having to continue running activities after our own kids depart lest they collapse and this is leading to some hard feelings.
I&#39;ve been a cub scout leader for eleven years, starting in the program with my oldest son as a den leader and then continuing when Youngest came along.&amp;nbsp; Along the way, I also became the cubmaster when that person left as her son moved on to boy scouts; it was my intent to do the same last year when Youngest moved up to boy scouts and indeed, I stepped down as cubmaster last winter.&amp;nbsp; Despite more than year of notices, entreaties and warnings however, no one stepped up to the position for the remainder of the cub scout year.&amp;nbsp; The pack committee chair also resigned when her son decided to quit scouting and as late summer progressed, it appeared that the pack would fold.&amp;nbsp; No one else took the positions and scouts left the pack as it flirted with folding for lack of volunteer leadership.&amp;nbsp; When another scouting mother &#45; who was also an assistant scoutmaster with an Eagle scout son &#45; stepped up to the committee chair and asked me, I returned for a one&#45;year gig as cubmaster, where we&#39;re still awaiting someone to take over as cubmaster.&amp;nbsp; My expectation/plan/desire/hope is to leave that slot and step up to become more active at the boy scout level where Youngest now resides.
But somewhere along the line, the cub scout gig morphed from being a temporary stint with my son to the apparently permanent job as Cubmaster.&amp;nbsp; This change was brought home by an encounter at the grocery store last week when I passed a woman whose son is a new cub scout; we glanced at one another in the doorway and each of us muttered a perfunctory hello when she did a double take and blurted out Oh it&#39;s you...I didn&#39;t recognize you without the uniform.&amp;nbsp; And I suddenly was in an alternate DC Comics universe in which a simple change of shirt hid my identity as Lord Baden&#45;friggin&#39;&#45;Powell.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t an isolated situation as it&#39;s a scenario playing out across activities and areas.&amp;nbsp; There are other cub packs and boy scout troops in similar straits and the Girl Scouts are literally dying for want of leadership &#45; on top of the whole interest problem.&amp;nbsp; The local little league is looking for coaches and the list goes on.
When you review the BLS article, what stands out is that those in the prime parent categories &#45; ages 35 &#45; 44 and kids under the age of 18 &#45; remained strong at 30.6% and 32.7% respectively.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of parents who step up but still plenty more who don&#39;t and when you talk to the organization folks at the regional levels and higher, what they&#39;re seeing is that fewer younger parents are stepping up; my suspicion is that this is the early cusp of a trend that will be reflected in the BLS in future years.
One of the comments that I&#39;ve heard repeatedly across years and activities is I don&#39;t know anything about that stuff.&amp;nbsp; I respect the concern because no parent wants to look like a flaming moron in front of their child but the reality is that we&#39;re all confronted with situations in which we have no real experience.&amp;nbsp; We do our best and let the chips fall where they may.&amp;nbsp; But the other reality is that the kids really do appreciate what their folks are willing and able to do for them and as they age, are able to show some graciousness when our team doesn&#39;t do well or something goes awry at a scouting event.&amp;nbsp; For the kids, it isn&#39;t necessarily how much you know about something as your behavior and manner in dealing with it and that&#39;s the lesson that we need to teach them as they in turn grow into adulthood &#45; it isn&#39;t necessarily what we know at the outset, but how we learn and then act as we move along.</body>

<title>A View From the Ridge, Part 4</title>
<body>Tonight was an evening that provided the periodic view from the ridge, an instance at which you move beyond the forest of everyday life and get a sense of where you&#39;ve been, are and are going.
Eldest is home for Spring Break but leaving with her mother to interview in a distant city with someone about a field for which she&#39;s preparing while in college.&amp;nbsp; The evening was spent however, at the local high school where Middle &#45; a junior &#45; sang the role of Zosar in Elton John&#39;s Aida.&amp;nbsp; While Eldest&#39;s intentions and plans are crystallizing, Middle&#39;s are clarifying and he&#39;s gaining a greater sense of what he&#39;ll pursue both in and after college as he takes the lesson to heart:  there&#39;s very much a role for college but you&#39;d better have a plan lest we needlessly waste funds.&amp;nbsp; Middle was present the other evening when we ran into one of Eldest&#39;s high school classmates, a young man who is pursuing his Gen Ed credits at a local community college before enrolling in the local state university for a criminal justice degree.&amp;nbsp; This guy understands that his preferred career as a state trooper, while helped by a college degree, isn&#39;t influenced one way or another by the choice or name of a particular institution.&amp;nbsp; And in about two months, Middle and I will travel to distant state university for his first interviews and the first of multiple overnight stays.
Time marches on.
And while still in elementary school, Youngest is himself changing.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s not yet a teen but has become concerned about his appearance and is, according to several teachers, already in the middle school mindset.&amp;nbsp; In some ways, he&#39;s also older than his siblings were at his age and that&#39;s partially due to the exposure to older siblings who&#39;ve helped bring him along and partially due to his own personality, upon which one teacher gently noted that he already doesn&#39;t take kindly to fools.&amp;nbsp; It ought to be interesting moving forward since there&#39;s probably nothing more foolish on God&#39;s green earth than a boy in his early teens.&amp;nbsp; Youngest still messes with his Legos but only when he and a buddy use them to make stop&#45;motion animation during sleepovers, and the rest of the toys are increasingly consigned to the closet.&amp;nbsp; Even his choice of sports is changing as he&#39;s planning to spend one more spring with baseball before shifting to another sport for middle school and beyond; while we haven&#39;t talked, I suspect that he&#39;s thinking ahead to college himself.
And as for me, things are also going to change.&amp;nbsp; While the elementary days are waning, my wife and I still believe that a parental presence and active involvement is crucial so long as the kids are at home and that&#39;s especially in the summer months.&amp;nbsp; So we&#39;ll see...</body>

<category>Child Development</category>
<title>Selfies and the Kids</title>
<body>As the 2014 Academy Awards aired downstairs, I overheard the family&#39;s commentary as host(&#45;ess) Elaine DeGeneres &#45; I don&#39;t even know which title is considered correct anymore &#45; gathered A&#45;list celebrities for what was subsequently billed as the &quot;Best Selfie Ever&quot;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the latest and most fame&#45;riddled in a long list of shots taken since the rise of the smartphone but the practice leads me to wonder about the effect of such activities on the kids who are now billed as the &quot;smartphone generation&quot;.&amp;nbsp; What should parents consider about letting their kids have access to take &quot;selfies&quot;?
The practice is here to stay as iPads and smartphones have become ubiquitous in today&#39;s culture.&amp;nbsp; When I took Middle to the local Social Security Administration office to replace a lost card, he was taken aback by the presence of toddlers &#45; no exaggeration here &#45; who were waiting with their own iPhones; while mothers and fathers plunked away on their own, these kids were swiping away at apps and taking more than a few selfies.&amp;nbsp; The practice has gained increasing increasing public attention, especially as more parents are allowing the kids to play with the smartphones.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s already the question of how much access should a toddler or preschooler have to a smartphone or an iPad, but the ability to take an almost unlimited number of photos of themselves leads to legitimate questions about the impact upon child development.
The linked article, republished in various forums in the US, raises some of the issues but I believe misses the largest point.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s natural that the kids want to see pictures of themselves since children are, by nature, egocentric beings.&amp;nbsp; All that they know when they are very young is the small world of themselves and their family and because they are incapable of caring for themselves, all obviously revolves around them.&amp;nbsp; Yes, seeing photos of themselves can help develop a self&#45;image but I honestly wonder whether seeing yet another photo of themselves leads to a healthy self&#45;image.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the major point made by critics of the unlimited access to selfies is that it feeds the problem of instant gratification since the kid can see the digital image immediately and then, with a swipe of a finger, make it disappear if it&#39;s not to their liking.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no having to wait for the results and no exercise of the valuable practice of patience.&amp;nbsp; But I believe that while the self&#45;gratification point is valid, it&#39;s just one more pebble on the already massive pile of society&#39;s practices that already promote instant gratification.&amp;nbsp; The large issue is that it promotes and contributes to the narcissistic tendencies that already exist in today&#39;s young generations.&amp;nbsp; Multiple studies  support the thesis that today&#39;s kids are far more self&#45;absorbed than previous generations.&amp;nbsp; The rise in permissive and helicopter parenting, the excessive use of praise and the onset of online social media platforms &#45; remember Xanga? &#45; that allow peers to like their buds for absolutely nothing of value have all contributed to this narcissism.&amp;nbsp; But allowing the kids to have unfettered access from a very young age will only reinforce the narcissistic tendencies from an even younger age and make the personality trait even more set in concrete than before.
It&#39;s natural to expect some narcissism from youngsters and I remember time spent in my &#39;tween/teen bedroom examining my visage and profile, mugging at the mirror and trying on different hats and looks as I explored my self&#45;image and personality.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s natural for kids to do that as they pass through various phases until they finally arrive at their adult personality and that&#39;s frankly why I&#39;ve never been terribly upset at the various looks, boyfriends/girlfriends and musical tastes that have come through the PracticalDad household...because what&#39;s happening now with the kids isn&#39;t necessarily permanent.&amp;nbsp; Wow, he&#39;s been listening to Swedish Death Ska for three months...and now he&#39;s listening to Mumford.  But my job as a parent is to raise the kids to make their way in the world as productive and moral adults, able to survive on their own and even make the place a little better, and that requires a person who can look outwards and see what&#39;s occurring around them; this is the antithesis of the narcissistic personality whose insularity keeps them looking inwards and hence unable to comprehend what might be hurtling in their direction let alone how their behaviors affect others.
So what to do?&amp;nbsp; First, give serious consideration to how much you let the kids handle the smartphone; it&#39;s a convenient, pocket&#45;sized babysitter that&#39;s of value on occasion but the kid won&#39;t learn patience if he&#39;s plugged into the Matrix whenever nothing&#39;s going on.&amp;nbsp; Second, if you let the kids take some selfies, go ahead and delete their selfies in their presence.&amp;nbsp; While I don&#39;t have a smartphone, I&#39;ve let the kids mess with my digital camera and take selfies; when I&#39;ve gone back through the memory card and seen them, I&#39;ve deleted the photos in their presence just to drive the point home that excessive use is simply a waste of a memory card that could be taken up with photos of real value and meaning.&amp;nbsp; Trust me, it&#39;s certainly garnered looks of hurt but a little dose of humility isn&#39;t going to hurt them.&amp;nbsp;Third, make sure that you model appropriate behavior by not engaging in such behavior in their presence unless it&#39;s of merit, such as an event or trip.</body>

<title>Practical Lessons Abound</title>
<body>If you sit back and keep your eyes open, the practical lessons abound.&amp;nbsp;
Such is the case with Middle, who&#39;s now in high school and beginning to receive the rush of mailers from prospective colleges for life after high school.&amp;nbsp; But amidst all of the flyers and brochures was a package from Gillette with a picture of a grizzled Clay Matthews on the reverse side and a glistening new razor on the other.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I&#39;m a throwback guy who&#39;s rough and masculine but that&#39;s no reason to have unsightly stubble...is the message that resonates inside the heads of the neophyte shavers.&amp;nbsp; Middle opened the box and out slid a new Gillette Fusion razor, ready and waiting to make his face smooth as a baby&#39;s butt.
Cool! was Middle&#39;s comment, and that&#39;s where the lessons began.&amp;nbsp;
Are there refills with that razor?&amp;nbsp; I asked.
Nah, just the razor itself was Middle&#39;s response.&amp;nbsp; So after a certain number of usages, Middle&#39;s going to have to buy refills &#45; check that, I&#39;m going to have to buy refills since high schoolers don&#39;t have the green to buy pricey razor refills &#45; if he plans to use the razor moving forward.&amp;nbsp; The reality in the PracticalDad household is that while Middle is already shaving, he and I use the same brand of razor so that the refills can be shared between us to cut down the cost.&amp;nbsp; My own beard is the consistency of steel wool from years of daily dry shaving and his own face doesn&#39;t grow enough stubble to require a daily shave, so we can get by with a shared refill pack.&amp;nbsp;
So, I asked, if they&#39;re sending you a free razor, where do you think that they make their money? &amp;nbsp;
Middle glanced down at the package and nodded.&amp;nbsp; So this is like the printer ink?
I nodded back.&amp;nbsp; The conversation went to the ground covered in a previous conversation that we&#39;d had.&amp;nbsp; This instance with the razor was no different than HP or another manufacturer that sells computer printers; the device is literally a throwaway and their money going forward would be made by the ongoing sales of highly priced ink.&amp;nbsp; Be aware that when someone offers you something for free, it might be nice but the likelihood is that they aren&#39;t Mother Teresa and they&#39;ve got some way of profiting from it.&amp;nbsp; The question is whether you understand that and whether you actually need what&#39;s being peddled, such as printers.
The next question was one for which he had no answer.&amp;nbsp; So how do you think Gillette got your name and approximate age for the mailing?&amp;nbsp; Middle glanced down as he thought about it and after a few seconds said I dunno.&amp;nbsp; How?&amp;nbsp; It was now that he learned about mailing lists, how organizations that had basic demographic data &#45; like the College Board perhaps &#45; sold those lists to willing buyers.&amp;nbsp; So Gillette can determine who their market will be and then go to a data source for the list of everyone in that demographic group...so while some of this is unavoidable, understand that it happens and be careful to whom you provide information.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that we&#39;ve allowed corporations and the government to construct all of these background structures that are utterly opaque to people who are just trying to make their way.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a fairly smart, cynical guy and even I&#39;m still surprised at learning about we&#39;re constantly gamed by corporate and governmental entities.&amp;nbsp; A frequent tagline now used in the PracticalDad household is the simple pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, uttered when public promises and niceties are uttered; these would include the IRS denials that there was even&#45;handed application towards applications for non&#45;profit status by political groups and the President&#39;s comments that policyholders could continue with their policies under the new Affordable Care &#45; aka &quot;Obamacare&quot; &#45; Act.&amp;nbsp; What I want my kids to learn is that they start looking around for a figurative curtain to help ascertain whether what&#39;s said is believable or simply more tripe.
We now live in a largely opaque culture, one that we&#39;ve allowed the various corporations and government to create over the decades.&amp;nbsp; There might be legitimate reasons for complexity, but the truth is that without a functional regulatory and judicial structure, then opacity is simply a curtain behind which all manner of amoral and unethical activities can occur.&amp;nbsp; Even when they&#39;re ostensibly adults, our kids are still babes in the woods ready for the taking by whomever has the ability to control the curtains.&amp;nbsp; Keep your head up and your eyes open, looking for any and all opportunities to help them learn to question and understand what&#39;s happening around them.</body>

<title>The Fed and My Family</title>
<body>December 2013 marked the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Federal Reserve System of the United States.&amp;nbsp; It has become the preeminent central bank in the world and its policies and practices ripple across the globe like a form of financial chaos theory.&amp;nbsp; The decision to taper the quantitative easing by a simple $10 billion each month leads to a liquidity crisis across the emerging economics as so much funding is withdrawn.&amp;nbsp; Much has been written about the Fed and it&#39;s become a lightning rod with supporters and detractors on either side but with very few in the middle.&amp;nbsp; But for all of the gigabytes written about it, how does this institution affect family?&amp;nbsp; It can certainly impact the interest rate on the mortgage and car note, but how does it affect my core role as a parent, to raise the kids to make their way in the world as productive and moral adults?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s these two simple adjectives &#45; productive and moral &#45; that frame my perspective.
I&#39;m afraid that the true impact isn&#39;t good and it&#39;s raising productive adults that is the first casualty of the Fed&#39;s policies.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t a bug in the system, it&#39;s the proverbial feature since our entire American economic model is now predicated upon consumption.&amp;nbsp; When you google kids materials for the Federal Reserve System, one of the first links is to Great Minds Think, an educational source published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.&amp;nbsp; Glance through the table of contents and you&#39;ll find that the section on saving is #8, well past the sections on earning and spending money.&amp;nbsp; The message to the user &#45; intentional or not &#45; is that we teach the kids to be good consumers before we teach them to be good savers.
While there don&#39;t seem to be any overt commentaries by the Fed on the raising of kids, there is one particular speech by then&#45;Chairman Ben Bernanke that provides an important clue about the attitude of both the Fed and the economic system towards the family unit.&amp;nbsp; Chairman Bernanke gave prepared remarks to a conference of high school economics teachers in August 2012 and while it&#39;s boiler plate pap on the face, it&#39;s fascinating in another way if you&#39;re willing to parse it.&amp;nbsp; Bernanke praised the educators for their work &#45; commenting that he himself was an educator, having been an economics professor &#45; and noted the importance of children having a proper financial education.&amp;nbsp; But it bothered me and it took several readings over time to pinpoint the source of the discomfort.&amp;nbsp; The point of education is to prepare the youngsters to take their place in the adult world and he routinely referred to them as young people and students.&amp;nbsp; By my count, there were fifteen references to the youth throughout the talk.&amp;nbsp; What was different however, was in the references to the adults.&amp;nbsp; When speaking about adults in general, excluding the educators, there were eight references.&amp;nbsp; One reference used the term American and two others used the word people.&amp;nbsp; But the remaining five references consistently used the term consumer.&amp;nbsp; There is no other descriptive noun used.&amp;nbsp; Citizen?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; Adult?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; Even when the parent is mentioned, it&#39;s in the context of working on exercises with the kids so that they too, can learn.&amp;nbsp; The upshot of the talk is that our role is to raise our children to take their adult economic place as consumers.
The problem with this philosophy is that the consumer&#45;driven economic model is actively dying.

    Since the start of the recession in late 2007, family incomes have dropped more than 6%, despite a rebound in the last two years.
    Fully 75% of the jobs created as of the first half of 2013 were part&#45;time, without benefits because of weak activity and corporate fears of teh effects of the coming Affordable Care (&amp;quot;Obamacare&amp;quot;) Act.
    The chaos of the ACA will significantly impact American family consumer spending as families are forced to spend more on their healthcare, either via higher premiums and deductibles or simply doing without insurance and paying their healthcare costs out &#45;of&#45;pocket.

The necessity then is to save more and to teach the kids to save instead of consume but again, the Federal Reserve has a policy regarding saving as well.&amp;nbsp; The imposition of artificially low interest rates makes it counterproductive to save and in a practical sense, punishes it by teaching the kids that they&#39;re better off to spend their money instead of putting it away for later.&amp;nbsp; Such has been the lesson for the older kids when they realized that their passbook savings rates of .1% yielded nothing of value through the course of a year.&amp;nbsp; This was also the lesson that Youngest began to realize when he came home from school last week, announcing that I want to get a CD. &amp;nbsp;When I inquired what he meant by CD, he responded a Certificate of Deposit, Dad with a note of amused derision in his 6th grade voice.&amp;nbsp; He subsequently explained to me what it was and commented that the teacher&#39;s example utilized a five year CD rate of .87%, which the teacher noted as a really good rate. &amp;nbsp;So Youngest now knows that his passbook rate is about .1% and can appreciate the relative eight&#45;fold improvement between the savings and CD rates.&amp;nbsp; Dad, I might as well get something better for it since I&#39;m not going to use it...&amp;nbsp; But for every kid who says that, how many are taking the opposite lesson that there&#39;s no practical value in saving?&amp;nbsp; Dude, I can take all of that annualized extra interest and download me another Avenged Sevenfold EP &#45; WOOT!!
So the kids can get a five year CD with an annualized return of .87%.&amp;nbsp; With a morbidly obese national debt requiring tender care, a wrecked fiscal policy via a broken Congress and a zombified real economy dependent upon these artificially low rates, I doubt that the Fed will willingly raise rates within the next five years.&amp;nbsp; The Fed can &#45; will have to &#45; keep these nominal rates low but the fact is that the rest of the world is not willing to continue purchasing our debt at such rates of return and the Fed itself has become the world&#39;s largest buyer of US Treasury debt.&amp;nbsp; But the Fed cannot continue to purchase the notes indefinitely and the rates will have to rise in order for the rest of the world to accept the risk that comes with such an outsized debt.&amp;nbsp; This is why I look at the President&#39;s new MyRA retirement savings program with such incredulity; it&#39;s touted as a risk&#45;free return in a low&#45;return world but the entire program simply smacks of a means to gain access to the public savings that will be used to purchase the government bonds that the Fed is no longer capable of purchasing itself because of a bloated balance sheet.&amp;nbsp; And when we burn through that cache of cash because there&#39;s no fiscal discipline, then the government bonds will indeed be risky as default lurks.&amp;nbsp; Greece, Spain and the peripheral nations on the southern edge of Europe are instructive examples.
These influences are part and parcel of raising a child to be a moral adult.&amp;nbsp; We as parents can do everything that we can to teach morality, but society&#39;s influence is pervasive and short of going Amish, what occurs in the larger realm does filter down to the family level.&amp;nbsp; The policies of the Fed dovetail with the hands&#45;off financial deregulation of the government to protect the financial sector, even when it engages in practices that are illegal, unethical and immoral, far beyond the purview of their original businesses of taking deposits and lending.&amp;nbsp; The young people learn that there is indeed a judicial double standard as financial malfeasance is unpunished while student debt collections become more overbearing and garden variety crimes receive increasingly severe punishments.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t believe that there&#39;s a different standard for the financial wizards, consider this.&amp;nbsp; If a Wall Street establishment is fined an amount that is still far less than the offense and the institution gets to negotiate the amount of the fine, then there&#39;s a different standard and the fine is, to the firm, just another cost of doing business with a budgetary line&#45;item somewhere between labor costs and paper clips.
Along with the judicial impact is the fact that more than a handful of institutions are now considered&amp;nbsp; Too Big To Fail, a term which means that their bankruptcy would imperil the entire financial system.&amp;nbsp; To accommodate these firms. the Fed established a significant number of back room arrangements starting in 2007; so the firms were nursed through the crisis.&amp;nbsp; But then supports were continued with no effort at restraining the behavior so that the risks, particularly through the growth of derivatives, have grown even larger than they were in 2007.&amp;nbsp; This is the monetary equivalent of nursing your kid through self&#45;inflicted auto accident injuries and then buying him a brand new car with no repercussions or discipline.&amp;nbsp; The need and ability to assess risk, to be judicious and prudent with the capital, is rendered irrelevant as the institutions understand that there is no real loss because they are hooked up to their sweet Sugar Feddy.&amp;nbsp; The are losing &#45; some have arguably lost &#45; the ability to make decisions that reflect an awareness that they have to stand on their own feet and could truly fail.&amp;nbsp; As I write about this aspect, it&#39;s striking to consider the parallels of the present relationship between the Fed&#39;s actions regarding their constituent banks and the actions of parents who hover over their children, not allowing them to take their place in the real world.&amp;nbsp; The continuation of this trend will lead to the training of a generation of financial decision&#45;makers who are incapable of standing on their own two feet.&amp;nbsp; This analogy does however, not account for the reality that the Fed&#39;s kids are borderline sociopathic kleptocrats.
This article isn&#39;t an idle philosophic musing.&amp;nbsp; Raising a kid to take his or her place as an adult means that there are countless conversations that must occur; it isn&#39;t enough to talk about the birds and the bees and discourage drug use, the conversations must also go to current events, politics, money and yes, morality.&amp;nbsp; The kids must learn that when the real capital becomes tight &#45; not the dollars presently coursing through &#45; the safety nets will fail or, at the least, fray.&amp;nbsp; There will not be a Sugar Feddy around to pick up after them as they have with the banks that have indeed captured them and usurped their function.&amp;nbsp; They are going to have to be able to make judgments and to produce.&amp;nbsp; And they&#39;re going to have to understand the difference between right and wrong because that capital will be tight enough that the regulatory oversight will have returned with a resounding vengeance to protect it.&amp;nbsp; Parents can no longer be unaware of the policies of the Fed; they must begin to understand what&#39;s occurring and amend their parenting to both account for it and counter it until acceptable policies have returned.
It was both unsurprising and disconcerting about two years ago when my middle child &#45; then in middle school &#45; asked why I should worry about being honest.&amp;nbsp; God knows many others were getting away with robbery.&amp;nbsp; There was little that I could say apart from the seemingly inane remark that somebody had to maintain some integrity and that there was value to being able to look at yourself in the mirror in the morning.
And that conversation, in a front seat en route home from yet another practice, has stayed with me since then.&amp;nbsp; Because he is a kid who listens and pays attention and you&#39;d be surprised at how many of the kids, purportedly tuned out, are actually keeping an ear cocked to what&#39;s going on.&amp;nbsp;
A central bank in and of itself isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing.&amp;nbsp; There is a systemic function to the fulfilled, one that was handled with some ability prior to the onset of the roaring 90s with its deregulation and concurrent unwilllingness by the Fed to allow failure.&amp;nbsp; Banks are aided by the ability to draw prudently upon a central source for funding in the event of true necessity but the term prudent dictates that this would be in the event of circumstances beyond their own control.&amp;nbsp; To permit them the unfettered access in the face of their own unbridled greed and foolishness simply teaches them that there are no consequences to poor decisions.&amp;nbsp; The resultant monstrous misallocation of capital means that we&#39;ve spent our money on radioactive granite countertops instead of lathes and machine tools that help us compete in the adult world, the one that our kids will be entering.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index - February 2014:&nbsp; Deflation is Taking Hold</title>
<body>The pricing data has been collected and reviewed and although there&#39;s a minimal increase in both February&#39;s Total and Food&#45;Only Indices, I was actually stunned by the price activity for food items in one of the three stores surveyed.&amp;nbsp; In this particular grocery chain, six of the 37 food items (16% of the surveyed products) had price declines greater or equal to 14%; the four canned vegetables each had a price decline of 20%.&amp;nbsp; While they are individually impressive, the nominal impact is small since these items do not constitute an outsized portion of the PracticalDad Price Index Market Basket.
The monthly results are listed below:
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;Only Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread

Both the Total and Food&#45;Only Indices increased slightly in February (11/2010 = 100) from January, although the Food&#45;Only Index is still well below its high of 114.33, reached in December 2012.&amp;nbsp; But while the indices show stable pricing, it&#39;s the result of pricing at one of the three stores that truly surprised me as more than 6 of the 37 Food&#45;Only basket items &#45; a rate greater than one in six items &#45; showed a monthly price decline greater than 14%; in fact, the four canned vegetable products each showed a non&#45;sales price drop of 20% as each fell from a January 2014 price of $.99/can to $.79/can.&amp;nbsp; The two month results for the six food items is listed below.

So what&#39;s the difference here versus other months, when there is always movement of some or another basket item to the downside from one month to the next?&amp;nbsp; Why should this particular situation be different?&amp;nbsp;From my perspective, there are some specific issues that make this occurrence not only different but actually an indication that deflation is actually beginning to take hold within the economy.
Start with a simple description of inflation provided several years ago by a commenter named Dryfly on Calculated Risk, in which he described deflation from that period as:&amp;nbsp;We could get a candy bar for a nickel and then a year later, get three candy bars for a dime.&amp;nbsp; Two years later, nobody had a dime.&amp;nbsp; The upshot of this excellent description is that deflation is not fully a function of price declines, but that the declines are part of an effort by producers to coax money from an increasingly tapped consumer; at some point, deflation is also a function of a lack of income/money flowing through the system.&amp;nbsp; Please bear this description in mind as we move forward.
The first issue pertains to the nature of the items in question, which are listed above with their January 2014 and February 2014 results respectively.
Each of the items is generic and within the control of the grocery chain, unlike brand name products like infant formula and women&#39;s feminine pads.&amp;nbsp; The brand name products are manufactured by only a few companies and the various manufacturers have the comfort of knowing that they do have some control because there are fewer competitors.&amp;nbsp; It was in October 2013 that Zerohedge noted that Kimberly Clark management announced that they&#39;d be increasing margin profitability by decreasing package sizing &#45; stealth inflation&#45; in step with their competitors.&amp;nbsp; The companies understand that they can do these things because while there is competition, the markets are limited and the options to those correspondingly limited; Hey guys, there are only so many alternatives for you out there, so heeeeeerrrrrree ya go...
The second issue is the financial health of the grocery chain within which these price decreases occurred.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve noted anecdotal evidence that the chain is struggling and a cursory Google search for that chain&#39;s most recent results showed that the financial figures for the 3rd quarter of 2013 were down from 3rd quarter of 2012.&amp;nbsp; Sales slid 1% and net income dropped almost 33% in that year&#45;over&#45;year basis.&amp;nbsp; Of the five grocery chain locations within a half hour distance from my house, one closed approximately 15 months ago and another, located in a lower&#45;income urban area, announced that the store would no longer be open on a 24/7 basis but would instead close at midnight effective February 1, 2014.&amp;nbsp; Of the other three, one is in a clearly rural area and only two are in solidly &amp;quot;middle&#45;class&amp;quot; neighborhoods.&amp;nbsp; I also personally know a young acquaintance who works as store management at a more distant location and he&#39;s being forced to put in far, far longer hours because they won&#39;t hire additional management to assist him.
If the customer base can no longer support the sales, then the chain must do whatever is necessary to stay afloat.&amp;nbsp; Store closings?&amp;nbsp; Check. &amp;nbsp;Store hours shortened?&amp;nbsp; Check. &amp;nbsp;Making do with fewer employees?&amp;nbsp; Check. &amp;nbsp;Increase special sales and circulars?&amp;nbsp; Per the noted Google article, check. &amp;nbsp;When all else is failing, begin to cut prices on products within their control in order to increase sales?&amp;nbsp; Now, check.
Remember that price is nothing more than the point at which a seller is able to sell her product to a prospective buyer.&amp;nbsp; In the huge number of transactions that come from grocery shopping, this is a highly impersonal point and most simply pay the marked price or wait until it&#39;s on sale.&amp;nbsp; But if the seller can&#39;t move the product, then the price must decline to a point at which a buyer is willing or able to part with money for the item.&amp;nbsp; If the seller can control nothing more than the price, such as with generic groceries, and must lower their price to the point at which buyers are willing to pay, then the seller is losing control of the pricing mechanism.&amp;nbsp; This is a key symptom from the deflationary Great Depression of the early 1930s.&amp;nbsp; It is countering this deflation that is at the heart of the monetary actions taken by the global monetary authorities since 2008.
While some brand name prices might increase and the other stores remain stable, what&#39;s occurring at this particular grocer is deflationary.&amp;nbsp; As incomes drop, money is being sucked from the real economy and families are having to make greater distinctions about how much to spend and where to shop.&amp;nbsp; The number of available grocers is being culled as weaker chains are forced to give ground on all fronts, including regular prices.&amp;nbsp; When everything fails, then that grocer will be forced to shutter the doors permanently and the focus will go to the next weakest grocer.&amp;nbsp; This process will continue either until a new family income equilibrium level is reached or all of the grocers finally go broke, which is in effect a total collapse of the supply chain.&amp;nbsp;
So remember the takeaway from all of this.&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t have deflation because prices are going down.&amp;nbsp; We have prices going down because the supporting incomes are declining as money is being sucked from the system; in this case, the family incomes.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Marijuana and the Family</title>
<body>This article&#39;s title is vastly different from the one originally planned, more sedate and less witty &#45; at least as far as I was concerned &#45; than its predecessor.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;ve written about the changes in marijuana law and policy before (here, here, and here), this article was prompted by the flurry of articles referencing the President&#39;s comments on marijuana in his interview with David Remnick of The New Yorker; the gist of most was that the purported Stoner&#45;in&#45;Chief was ambivalent about the legalization of pot and ran with an undercurrent of right&#45;wing law&#45;and&#45;order disapproval.&amp;nbsp; The original opening paragraph was likewise offended by the comments, but then I decided that I ought to first read the article &#45; and it&#39;s a tome &#45; in entirety and to my frank surprise, found that his comments mirror what&#39;s being said in this household to the kids.
The President was asked about the legalization of marijuana and his opinion reflected the changes that my own have undergone as well in the past several years, with one caveat.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not in favor of it but see how it will become more acceptable, having heard the debate points at the family dinner table about how pot is really not harmful and certainly not affecting the judgment or reflexes like alcohol.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, Dad, have you ever heard of someone having an accident while stoned? Actually, yes...&amp;nbsp; I also understand the President&#39;s comments about the prevalence of marijuana convictions in today&#39;s penal system, especially with racial disparities between young African&#45;American teens and others.&amp;nbsp; One of my growing bugaboos about the country today is that we&#39;ve developed a multi&#45;tier judicial system and that the elites are sheltered from serving time in a penal system that in some cases has a financial incentive for incarceration.&amp;nbsp; So if we&#39;ve got to fill beds, let&#39;s fill &#39;em with the potheads since they&#39;re young, politically stupid and generally more controllable than others in society...&amp;nbsp; The President and I are similar in our ages and both came of age in the 1970s but while the President smoked dope, I demurred since I frankly thought that the feeling wasn&#39;t worth the money or the risk of legal trouble.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re also alike in that we have children who are now out and about in the school system, coming into contact with a wide variety of kids whose upbringing and family opinions don&#39;t jibe with our own.
There are similarities as well in our conversations with the kids about smoking dope, although my language has been a bit different.&amp;nbsp; While I agree that it&#39;s a waste of time (and money) and a vice, I found his description of pot&#45;smoking as a bad habit hilariously off the mark.&amp;nbsp; I shared this short segment of the entire article with the two sons and commented that cracking knuckles and chewing with your mouth open is a bad habit, but smoking dope is something else entirely...&amp;nbsp; The kids are also aware that while it&#39;s now legal in Colorado and Washington, we still live in Pennsylvania and it&#39;s clearly illegal here and the household rule is the same as that with which my wife and I were raised, i.e. if you&#39;re old enough to get into legal trouble, you&#39;re old enough to deal with the consequences &amp;nbsp; Until society finally decides one way or another, we&#39;re going to follow the company line and even then, I&#39;ll choose not to indulge.&amp;nbsp; One of the other arguments against when discussing it with the kids is that there are long&#45;term health consequences to smoking weed.&amp;nbsp; In 2012, a UK study over a four decade period found that those who started and used marijuana regularly while younger &#45; especially below 18 years of age &#45; had an average IQ drop of 8 points in their adulthood.&amp;nbsp; This is especially important for the youngsters as we&#39;re all going to be entering a period in which everyone&#39;s going to be competing more than ever before for limited resources and opportunities.&amp;nbsp;
There is one aspect that the President left unsaid.&amp;nbsp; One of the key aspects in the referenda victories was the notion of taxation for revenues and it&#39;s here that family conversation has revolved.&amp;nbsp; My recurrent phrase to the boys at home has been follow the money, a reminder from the Watergate informer, Deep Throat, that the answer to many questions lies at a trail involving money.&amp;nbsp; After the referenda victories out west, there was a wonderously eloquent silence from the federal government and if you listened closely, that cricket&#45;like sound was actually the noise of distant adding machines in Washington, DC tabulating the potential revenue windfall should legalization go national.&amp;nbsp; It was literally weeks before there was any substantive comment from the President and it was the simple statement that budget issues being what they are, the Justice Department has bigger fish to fry than the wholesale prosecution of marijuana producers and users.&amp;nbsp; This was the comment that is setting the tone for the public policy regarding marijuana and it&#39;s the basis for a later family conversation about not just marijuana but also the role of government.&amp;nbsp; The boys learned that when Pennsylvania was considering a state lottery in the 1970s, one of the questions raised was whether the government should be in the business of profiting from the legalization of what is arguably &#45; as per our President &#45; a vice; it&#39;s a philosophic question that is still relevant as the various levels of government prepare to profit from present and future legalization.&amp;nbsp; If the government is going to take a long&#45;held position and throw it into the trash heap, ask yourself why and whether it really is a reasonable change or one based upon cynical calculation.
Now that the first steps have been made towards the legalization &#45; and taxation &#45; of marijuana, parents are going to have to think long and hard about their own family stance on marijuana since this is coming back into the parental faces.&amp;nbsp; Take some time to look at the studies and then examine your own history, remembering that it&#39;s okay to have a different opinion about it than when you yourself were a teenager...that&#39;s the value of maturity and distance.&amp;nbsp; Then go to the hard work of talking with the kids and forming a family line on the issue, and preparing to come back to that line again, and again, and yet again.&amp;nbsp; Because while the President might have some grounds for moral suasion on any particular question, the reality is that your kids will often listen to you and your commentary.&amp;nbsp; Even when you think that they aren&#39;t.</body>

<category>Father Lessons</category>
<title>Waterloo:&nbsp; Old Dad versus Young Dad</title>
<body>There are the occasional periodic articles about how the average age of fathers has risen and the advantages of being an older dad.&amp;nbsp; Ed Pritchett, the patriarch of ABC&#39;s Modern Family is a prime&#45;time example of an older dad working through the fatherhood process.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not ready to concede that fatherhood is indeed a young man&#39;s game but after a recent Friday night campout, I&#39;m willing to concede that I finally met my Waterloo.
The evening in question was a night spent at a Boy Scout Klondike Derby, a winter camping event in which scout troops gather to compete in various competitive events.&amp;nbsp; The Klondike aspect is that each troop must push or pull it&#39;s own handmade sled from a starting line and then onwards to each of ten separate event stations; the sled can also be mounted on detachable wheels to allow it to run when there is no snow.&amp;nbsp; When the weekend is finished, each troop takes it&#39;s sled back and stores it for the following winter Klondike.&amp;nbsp; It was questionable at the outset whether or not I would even be attending since my Saturday morning was already booked with a cub scout pinewood workshop at a friend&#39;s shop and Middle had a Saturday evening concert that I planned to attend.&amp;nbsp; When there were some questions from Youngest, I agreed that I&#39;d camp with him at the troop site on Friday night and return home Saturday morning, returning back to the troop site that evening after the concert was finished and staying to help break down camp on Sunday morning.&amp;nbsp; Parents with multiple children will understand the variety of plan permutations that are considered before a final resolution is made.
This year&#39;s particular Klondike occurred in early January on the heels of the returning Polar Vortex so that the temperatures were, to say the least, erratic.&amp;nbsp; There was snow on the ground the day before the event was to begin and on the dawn of the day&#39;s start, the temperature warmed to allow rain before finally dropping again below the freezing mark; our arrival was marked by the inability of Youngest&#39;s troop to access the campsite without a four&#45;wheel drive vehicle to haul the gear up.&amp;nbsp; Another local troop was forced to camp in the main dining pavilion because the trail to their site was completely impassable.&amp;nbsp; We pitched our tents on frozen, ice&#45;covered ground in the rain and then set up the chuck box and cooking gear under a tarp that we threw over existing canopy poles.&amp;nbsp; A campfire was only possible because another adult brought along all manner of debris and paperwork that was used for firestarting &#45; and it was here that I learned that potato chips cooked in lard actually make a decent firestarter, holding a flame long enough for the surrounding paper to catch.&amp;nbsp; When we finally turned in for the night, we found that everything was damp because the water simply permeated everything; ice, snow, rain and a London&#45;quality fog caused by the mix of warming air and frozen ground.&amp;nbsp; Youngest and I shared a two man tent; even with an extra sleeping bag spread out under our own two bags, I was wet, cold and uncomfortable, a cocktail that bred a full&#45;bodied ache through my middle&#45;aged frame.&amp;nbsp; When the morning came &#45; after only an hour&#39;s sleep &#45; I was barely able to move because of a longstanding physical impairment and had to tell Youngest then that there was no earthly way that I could spend another night there.&amp;nbsp; It was a painful moment of personal defeat, and not just physical.
Younger fathers do have it over us older guys.&amp;nbsp; They are more physically capable of participating in the activities and it was that morning that I&#39;d wished I was twenty years younger.&amp;nbsp; We do have it over the twenty&#45;somethings in that there is a greater breadth of experience but that&#39;s a poor compensation when the issue is camping or the outdoor stuff that the kids often want to do.&amp;nbsp;
So what is the point here, apart from belaboring my own frailty?&amp;nbsp; The point is that fathers are going to be called upon to step outside of their comfort zone in any number of ways.&amp;nbsp; Guys who were bookworms might wind up camping and varsity football players might wind up coaching their daughter&#39;s midget league basketball team.&amp;nbsp; And older dads will have to figure out how to navigate the physical activities that wouldn&#39;t have fazed us two decades ago.&amp;nbsp; The point is that we try and if we fall on our collective asses, then at least we did so trying.&amp;nbsp; The kids aren&#39;t stupid and they understand that dads &#45; and moms &#45; aren&#39;t perfect.&amp;nbsp; But they also understand that we&#39;re making the effort and if we fail, then at least we can also hopefully demonstrate how to respond to the defeats and knocks that life hands us.&amp;nbsp; And that is a bigger lesson than how to pitch a tent or roll up a sleeping bag.
The Klondike night was one that I don&#39;t regret, but one that I certainly won&#39;t repeat.&amp;nbsp; Youngest knows that while I&#39;ll continue camping with him, there are simply some circumstances that will keep me inside.&amp;nbsp; What I hope that he&#39;ll take with him as he ages is that it&#39;s okay to admit defeat but that it at least comes after the attempt.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Pig Wrestling</title>
<body>There are a multitude of lessons to teach the kids as they move on through life and it&#39;s a good thing to have a brief descriptive tagline that, after you explain it originally, you can fall back upon as a reminder when the need arises.&amp;nbsp; And in this household, one of the taglines is the phrase pig wrestling. &amp;nbsp;The term is an old one and applies to the lesson that when you wrestle with pigs, they just love it and you just get dirty.&amp;nbsp; It was a phrase that&#39;s been used repeatedly in this household as the kids learn to deal with unpleasant people who simply enjoy stirring up trouble for no other reason than to sit back and enjoy the resultant fireworks.&amp;nbsp;
But the phrase&#39;s most recent use came upon relating a story to the three kids at a recent meal.&amp;nbsp; I related that&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d been sitting at a fast food place enjoying a cup of coffee when a mother and her two late &#39;tween daughters entered and sat at the next table.&amp;nbsp; One child was silent almost the entire time while her sibling put on a brat show worthy of a failed Nick Junior pilot; the mother took the orders from her children and went to the counter while they sat and the Princess proceeded with the show.&amp;nbsp; She spoke with a stereotypical brat whine and refused to even look at the menu board, easliy visible from her seat, requiring the mother to read the menu to her loud enough that the entire dining area could hear; a peripheral glance allowed me to see that her vision was fine since she was nose deep in her iThingy.&amp;nbsp; When her coffee was delivered without sugar, she made her mother &#45; the woman actually responded to her daughter&#39;s peremptory order &#45; return to the counter with the coffee and add the sugar for her,&amp;nbsp; She even openly insulted the staff on some point not to her satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; My comment to my kids was that I wanted to reach back and pop her, Gibbs&#45;style, across the back of her head and when Middle asked why I didn&#39;t at least say something to the girl, I could only shake my head and say pig wrestling. &amp;nbsp;My wife nodded and explained that this type of person would only complain and it was likely that Mom would feel compelled to come to the brat&#39;s rescue; my real options were to leave or stay and marvel at the show.
The sad fact that most adults know is that there are people who simply don&#39;t care how offensive they are or how they alienate others.&amp;nbsp; My own parents&#39; lesson to me was that they should simply be avoided whenever possible and engaged only when absolutely necessary; protesting their behavior and commentary was simply a waste of breath since these people often also enjoyed provoking others for their cheap entertainment.&amp;nbsp;
While kids today also have to learn that lesson, it&#39;s also more difficult than it was two or more decades ago for two reasons.&amp;nbsp; The first reason is the insidious effect of the gangsta culture that&#39;s been propagated through American society via the mass media.&amp;nbsp; One of the prime tenets of the gangsta culture revolves around the notion of disrespect; any instance of perceived disrespect has to be remedied immediately, even to the point of physical violence or death.&amp;nbsp; The two older kids have related stories from their middle and high school years in which being dissed was a prime component of potential violence amongst teens in a hallway.&amp;nbsp; One of these tales was even tagged with Eldest&#39;s startling remark, Dad, it&#39;s not a real fight until there&#39;s a knife... The second reason is the simple fact that the prevalent electronic devices and sites &#45; Facebook, Twitter and the like &#45; mean that rude or threatening comments are no longer simple verbal, but posted with an indefinite lifespan to perpetuate the real or perceived insult and rub salt in wounds of pride.&amp;nbsp; When the prevalent youth culture is influenced by the gangsta vibe, the foundation is laid for real violence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Even if you tell your kids to avoid the Twitterverse, some lunkhead can save a screenshot and pull it out at the lunchtable to share.&amp;nbsp;
You might not think it at times, but the kids will listen to you and what you advise.&amp;nbsp; The immediate response to proffered advice might be dismissive but there&#39;s a decent chance that they&#39;ll actually think about it and heed it.&amp;nbsp; But for this to happen, you have to pay attention to what&#39;s going around both you and them.&amp;nbsp; You have to be able to set aside your own activities when you note even a potential issue and you have to also pay attention to those electronic forums in which they&#39;re engaged.&amp;nbsp; You have to have an ongoing dialogue about daily events and be willing to dig when the circumstances demand it.&amp;nbsp; You also have to understand that there can be contention as the kids hear and process what you say, seeing how that advice can run against the grain of the tween/teen subculture.&amp;nbsp; And when the circumstances require it, you&#39;re going to have model the pig wrestling mantra, letting meaningless slights roll away.&amp;nbsp; The kids are watching you and the lessons take on greater meaning when they see them taken to heart.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Deflation, It&#8217;s What&#8217;s For Supper&#8230;</title>
<body>The debate about inflation versus deflation continues as we wade through the uncharted territory of Federal Reserve monetary policy.&amp;nbsp; The Powers That Be are desperate to avoid deflation and while they&#39;ve officially cut back on the latest round of Quantitative Easing by $10 Billion each month, a huge surge of liquidity continues to flow into the American economy.&amp;nbsp; But while the financial guys continue to call for inflation, particularly in commodities because of these monetary actions, the reality on the local grocery store shelves is revealed a bit differently in the January 2014 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index.
The results are honestly startling on one level and frankly angering on another level.
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;Only Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread
10/13&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 107.83&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 112.98&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4.63
11/13&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 107.83&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 112.81&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4.98
12/13&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 109.35&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 113.41&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4.06
01/14&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 109.30&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 112.39&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3.09
The Total Index for the 47 item market basket declined slightly in January 2014 to 109.35; the upshot is that since the index&#39;s inception in November 2010 (11/10 = 100.00), the price of the market basket has risen by 9.30% although this is still almost 1.5 percentage points higher than the index level of 107.83 two months earlier.&amp;nbsp;
What&#39;s startling is the activity of the 37 item Food&#45;Only Index &#45; which has been stripped of the 10 non&#45;food items &#45; over the past several months.&amp;nbsp; Again, the month of November 2010 is equal to 100.&amp;nbsp; While the index level spiked by .6 points in December 2013 from November 2013 &#45; 113.41 from 112.81 &#45; it collapsed in January by more than a full point to 112.39. the lowest level since October 2012, fifteen months previously and still almost a full two points below the Food&#45;Only Index peak of 114.33 in December 2012.&amp;nbsp; For food, this is frankly deflationary.&amp;nbsp;
So what&#39;s notable?

    Foodstuffs immediately relatable to commodities &#45; meats, oil and vegetables &#45; declined by signficant amounts.&amp;nbsp; In the one month between the December 2013 and January 2014 pricing trips, 21% of the basket items &#45; 10 of 47 &#45; had nominal price declines,&amp;nbsp; Offsetting this was the finding that 17% of the basket items &#45; 8 of 47 &#45; had nominal price increases.&amp;nbsp; For a full explanation of the PracticalDad Price Index basket components, see here.&amp;nbsp; But of these declines and advances, the huge majority of price declines &#45; eight of the ten &#45; were in the food category; there were items that could be considered statistical noise but a pound of chicken dropped by 3.8%, a 48 ounce bottle of canola cooking oil declined by 5.6%, a five pound bag of potatoes fell by 6.7% and a one pound pack of hot dogs plummeted by a full 10% as one or another grocery store somehow managed to put the same product on the shelf for a considerably less amount than before.
    Not all aspects of price inflation are related to monetary policy, but are instead purely business decisions.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case in the 7.2% increase in the cost of a size 3 box of diapers, purely due to the stealth tactic of decreasing the package size while maintaining the nominal price.&amp;nbsp; An October 2013 article in Zerohedge reprinted an internal document from Kimblerly&#45;Clark Corporation that they were planning to decrease the package sizing of their Huggies brand diapers &#45; which they consider to be a high margin product &#45; in keeping with competition.&amp;nbsp; I was surprised to see this so soon as one of the grocery store generic diaper package decreased in size from 96 to 84 diapers per pack (although I have converted each back to a 100 count unit price for the sake of uniformity), a 12.5% rise in the price of their product.&amp;nbsp; This comes on the heels of a significant stealth inflationary rise in the cost of formula and I fully expect that this will occur in the other store in the next several months; note that the third store simply removed their quantity sized box of diapers from their shelves more than a year ago, probably because the customer base doesn&#39;t purchase enough to make it worthwhile to carry in inventory.
    The activity within the 47 item market basket leads me to wonder what&#39;s occurring within the foodstuff supply chain.&amp;nbsp; First, there have been instances in which products have had signficant price declines in a particular store while the other stores have been unchanged.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case, for example, with a box of spaghetti and can of tomato sauce in a particular store and most recently, a huge 20% drop in the price of a one pound package of meat franks.&amp;nbsp; This is good news on one hand, but it would worry me if I was particular about the contents and quality of that particular item.&amp;nbsp;
    The other aspect of the supply chain &#45; and one that could link back to policy &#45; is that there are now occasional items which are intermittently missing from a particular store.&amp;nbsp; One store has wholly dropped the quantity box of diapers and quantity offering of Enfamil formula from their product offering, most likely due to a lack of customer demand and subsequent profitability.&amp;nbsp; But when I began the index in November 2010, there were no instances where a random product would be not only absent from the shelf, but wouldn&#39;t even have a shelf sticker.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s one thing to not have the inventory out, but another completely to not even have it available, as demonstrated by the complete absence of shelf stickers...and I actually do check for the stickers, even if I search for the sticker on the very bottom shelf on hands and knees.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s sporadic and intermittent, but it&#39;s now occurring.&amp;nbsp; It didn&#39;t happen when I shopped last week, but December 2013 had three instances of food items simply not there, a 2.7% rate (3/111 food items across three stores).

So pay attention to what you hear on the news, but understand that the commentary is just that.&amp;nbsp; Commentary.&amp;nbsp; Because we really are in uncharted waters...</body>

<title>Charging the Pretzel</title>
<body>The opportunities abound to teach about personal finance and yesterday&#39;s trip to pick up the family pictures provided yet another one.&amp;nbsp; Youngest had joined me for a trip to the mall to pick up the photos, as well as to purchase a new pair of good shoes to replace the ones that he&#39;d frankly outgrown to the point of pain; as we waited in the checkout line for the shoes, he glanced at me and playfully commented that he&#39;d hoped that we could maaaaayyybe split a pretzel or even better, each have one.&amp;nbsp; When I responded that we&#39;d be passing on that since I had no cash, he noted cursorily that I did have a credit card instead.&amp;nbsp; He was nonplussed at my curt response and the reminder that we had plenty upon which to snack at our own house, so he could simply suck it up.
We live in a society of immediate gratification and that affects almost everybody, me included.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a constant underlying drumbeat of consumption from mass media and while it&#39;s easy to understand that you can&#39;t constantly consume new cars and other large ticket items, it&#39;s not so easy to understand that you shouldn&#39;t constant consume the small ticket items like pretzels and Starbucks coffee.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the cumulative effect &#45; the coffee&#45;like drip, drip, drip if you will &#45; of this small consumption that nickels and dimes us to death and leads our kids to think that they really can just have it all now.&amp;nbsp;
After a moment of tense silence between the two of us, we began talking about how credit cards actually work and how the cardholder is actually paying the bank handsomely for the privilege of using the bank&#39;s money.&amp;nbsp; If many aren&#39;t paying off their balance each month, does it make sense that they should put a $2 pretzel on their card, only to finally pay it off in two months at a final cost greater than the original $2?&amp;nbsp; Expand that across more than just pretzels and that additional money can add up to something that can be used more productively elsewhere, for something of greater value.&amp;nbsp; Youngest is a kid with considerable sense, frankly far more sense than some adults that I know &#45; I&#39;ve actually witnessed him facepalm when he&#39;s watched adults do something stupid &#45; and he nodded in understanding.&amp;nbsp; He still wanted the pretzel, but he agreed that paying with a credit card wouldn&#39;t be the best move around.
Figure out what your own rules are for these kinds of things, such as using a credit card or giving to charity.&amp;nbsp; Then be sure that you take the opportunity to apply those rules when the kids are around and if you remember, comment on them accordingly.&amp;nbsp; As for the aftermath with Youngest, I made sure that when we got home from the mall, that a snack was pulled out and consumed with Youngest to prove that we did, indeed, have something in the house to eat.</body>

<title>Kids and Language:&nbsp; The Cussin&#8217; Code</title>
<body>It&#39;s clear that society has coarsened over the past four decades and that&#39;s especially the case with language.&amp;nbsp; What was once utterly unacceptable now hits the airwaves and across the texting media, both in terms of sheer language and also sexual imagery.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m a father and supposed to serve as a role model for the kids, my own language has always been &amp;quot;earthy&amp;quot; and my ex&#45;army DI father could curse as unconsciously as others breathe.&amp;nbsp; As the author Jean Shepherd once commented about the father in A Christmas Story:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;He worked in profanity the way other artists might work in oils or clay.&amp;nbsp; It was his true medium; a master.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; That has rubbed off and I&#39;ve had to work to control it over the years, sometimes more successfully than others.&amp;nbsp; But if I&#39;m not Ned Flanders, is there a language compromise &#45; an ethics of cussin&#39; &#45; that I should adopt?&amp;nbsp; To thine own self be true (dammit).
Being a member of the &#39;70s generational cohort that popularized the term you suck &#45; and knowing that it was originally referring to male genitalia &#45; it&#39;s jarring to hear the phrase used simultaneously in a grocery store by a grandparent and her early elementary school granddaughter in the local grocery store.

Granddaughter:&amp;nbsp; Ewww, I don&#39;t like that cereal &#39;cuz it sucks.
Grandmother:&amp;nbsp; Oh, I&#39;m sorry sweetie.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t know that it sucked.
Listen to the conversation and mentally complete the comments with a parenthetical slang term for male genitalia and you too, can experience the cognitive dissonance.&amp;nbsp; I almost had an ear&#45;bleed when I heard my own mother use the word suck in a conversation.&amp;nbsp; Well, that meal sucks.&amp;nbsp; (pause)&amp;nbsp; Honey, what&#39;s wrong? &amp;nbsp;
While the mental picture of childhood is puppy dog tails and Little Golden Books, the reality is that they&#39;re going to hear the language far sooner than later.&amp;nbsp; The term m*****f***** first came off the kids&#39; lips when Middle asked me &#45; then in preschool &#45; what it meant.&amp;nbsp; I actually pulled the car over and asked where he heard it and he responded that a classmate blurted it out when her block tower toppled over that morning.&amp;nbsp; While I tried to monitor my own language and be an example through the years, the influx of other words and phrases crept into the household from outside sources, typically the school but even church. Being asked by a middle&#45;school kid at my church whether I was familiar with the term donkey show &#45; a slang phrase so foul that I won&#39;t even link it to a definition &#45; was literally jaw&#45;dropping.&amp;nbsp; So how do I respond to all of this?&amp;nbsp; How do I walk a line that allows me to be, as Saint Paul once wrote, in the world yet not of it?&amp;nbsp;
There are several parameters to my handling of the cursing issue.&amp;nbsp;
The first parameter pertains to the kids understanding that Dad is the go&#45;to guy for practical, factual information on what these various terms mean.&amp;nbsp; Because the kids hear some profanity cross my lips, they&#39;re more comfortable in bringing unfamiliar terms and phrases to me than to their mother and it&#39;s that willingness that I encourage.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve told each of my three kids, early in their puberty, that I&#39;ll give them an honest definition of a particular phrase or term brought to me; they&#39;ll likewise also hear any synonyms for the phrase so that they can then put it context wherever they hear it next.&amp;nbsp; They also hear some guidance on appropriateness.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that they&#39;re going to certainly hear the terminology around their peers and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me &#45; disappoint perhaps, but not surprise &#45; if they also used the language to at least some extent.&amp;nbsp; But all three also gain a perspective on whether something is just cussing or whether there&#39;s something truly objectionable about a particular term.&amp;nbsp; They hear what terms I simply refuse to say and they hear the reasons why I choose not to say them, either because they&#39;re simply too profane or because of the second parameter, political correctness.&amp;nbsp;
Let me be frank in that I don&#39;t like political correctness.&amp;nbsp; Let me also be frank in acknowledging that the issue has run amok in the school system and there is a form of language/thought police activity occurring in the school system, a process that actively roots out any commentary regarding gender, race or sexual orientation.&amp;nbsp; I do understand the rationale behind it even if I believe that it gets carried to an extreme and in the heat of the moment, one wrong remark can land a kid in the principal&#39;s office; calling someone a dummy is sticks&#45;and&#45;stones material but referring to someone in an ethnic or gender format will land a kid in the doghouse, at least at the lower levels.&amp;nbsp; Using language based upon a person&#39;s appearance or gender also lessens the ability to learn to judge a person based upon their behavior and the content of their character, a crucial skill that many never master but important as a person navigates life.
The third parameter is admittedly odd, but it&#39;s that there are so many perfectly useful words that already exist and that simply slipping into profanity is simple laziness.&amp;nbsp; This came up in a conversation with Youngest some months ago when I heard him use a profane term to describe a person that didn&#39;t go to the stupidity of that kid&#39;s actions.&amp;nbsp; He could have used terms such as idiot, stupid, dumb, cretin or moron but he opted for the other instead and this was pointed out to him vigorously.
The fourth parameter is that there is a time and a place for profanity, although there are some who will certainly disagree.&amp;nbsp; On multiple occasions, I&#39;ve used profanity in order to drive a point home, making it a verbal and audible exclamation mark for the kid in question.&amp;nbsp; If my entire vocabulary consists solely of profanity, then using it to make a definitive point is lost as it simply becomes another expletive&#45;laced tirade and the message&#39;s import is lost.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index, December 2013:&nbsp; Stealth Inflation Strikes Again&#8230;</title>
<body>The results for the December 2013 PracticalDad Price Index are in and after a several month period in the doldrums, the total index for all 47 grocery items rose to 109.35 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; This 1.5 point rise &#45; from November&#39;s 107.83 &#45; is due in large part to the half point increase in the 10 non&#45;food items in the grocery basket; the non&#45;food components rose significantly based upon the increases in trash bags and more significantly, the stealth inflation rise in infant formula.&amp;nbsp; The 37 item Food&#45;Only Component Index likewise rose slightly more than a half point, from 112.81 in November to 113.41 in December (11/10 = 100).

Remember this about stealth inflation:&amp;nbsp; the nominal price on the item remains the same so the consumer might not realize until later that the package size has actually decreased.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the infant formula that&#39;s part of the PracticalDad basket, the manufacturer &#45; Mead Johnson &#45; decreased the size of Enfamil Premium formula from a 23.4 ounce package to 22.2 ounces, a decline of 5.1%.&amp;nbsp; The nominal price at the stores remained unchanged over the course of the two months, yet the impact of the stealth decrease meant that a real increase of 5.4% in the cost of the previous amount of the formula for the consumer.&amp;nbsp; There are several other notable items that I&#39;ve learned about stealth inflation from monitoring the PracticalDad Index basket for the past three years.

    The change is not instantaneous but occurs over time such that the increase&#39;s impact is diffused instead of an in&#45;your&#45;face event.&amp;nbsp; In the case of a national manufacturer, the change can be affected across different grocery stores by the amount of inventory held by that grocer in stock.&amp;nbsp; One of the grocery chains was selling the 23.4 ounce formula packages but the shelf sticker had already been changed to account for the new 22.2 packages; when the old inventory is depleted, it will be replaced by the smaller packages so that the product matches the sticker.&amp;nbsp; This situation also occurred with Poise Women&#39;s Pads, manufactured by Kimberly Clark, as one of the grocerys continued to sell the 42 pad package &#45; with the revised 39 pad package sticker &#45; until that inventory was sold out.&amp;nbsp;
    The effect of stealth inflation is also diffused by the fact that the different manufacturers are doing it at different rates and at different times.&amp;nbsp; Stealth inflation hit the generic label cans of coffee about two years ago and it took several months for the three different grocers to all move out of the original 13 ounce cans to their lesser sized cans.&amp;nbsp;
    Having said that it occurs over a period of time, understand that once a single manufacturer engages in stealth inflation by decreasing the package size, others will follow suit.&amp;nbsp; This is demonstrated by Kimberly&#45;Clark, the manufacturer of personal care products such as Poise Women&#39;s Pads, Cottonelle toilet paper and Huggies diapers.&amp;nbsp; An article in Zerohedge highlighted that Kimberly&#45;Clark would be decreasing the size of diaper packaging in Q1 of 2014.&amp;nbsp; Given that manufacturers follow suit over time, I anticipate that stealth inflation will further hit young families as other diaper manufacturers follow suit to also maintain their profit margins.&amp;nbsp;
    Stealth inflation doesn&#39;t just occur because of the rise in the input commodities, such as sugar and coffee.&amp;nbsp; These are also purely business decisions to pad corporate profits with no thought as to the situation of the consumer.&amp;nbsp; The language used by Kimberly&#45;Clark in their Q3 2013 Recap &#45; highlighted in the Zerohedge article &#45; makes no reference to the increases in input prices.&amp;nbsp; It refers to these different products as high margin businesses; decreasing packaging sizes is purely a business decision that benefits the corporation bottom&#45;line. So the cost of Huggies diapers will rise &#45; following the practice of other diaper manufacturers &#45; which further crimps the budgets of young families who are already whacked with declining family incomes.&amp;nbsp; Since Kimberly&#45;Clark has also decreased the package size of it&#39;s Poise Women&#39;s Pads (from 42 pads per package to 39), I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see a profit&#45;driven decrease in package sizing for Depends Undergarments, which also impacts an income&#45;afflicted marketing cohort.

So what&#39;s the takeaway from all of this for the family?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the lesson to be passed along to the kids that they are going to have to pay attention to the world around them, a difficult thing to do when wrapped in an electronic cocoon graciously provided by Apple and furnished by Google.&amp;nbsp; They exist for the benefit of the corporate bottom line, regardless of their own circumstance.
As my own father once told me decades ago:&amp;nbsp; Nobody&#39;s looking out for you, kid.

<title>Throw Momma Under the Bus</title>
<body>It&#39;s interesting to watch and listen to groups of people, especially in terms of male/female relationships.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case this weekend as Youngest helped me run a cub&#45;scout rocket launch &#45; yes, he&#39;s still in elementary school but I trust the kid implicitly to run a launch pad for younger kids (with another father overseeing from the sidelines) &#45; that was attended by scouts, siblings and families.&amp;nbsp; What was striking was the response of multiple fathers when something with the rocket didn&#39;t work properly, whether the fins fell off the rocket pre&#45;launch or it burned on the launch pad.&amp;nbsp; Each of these guys threw Momma under the bus.
Don&#39;t look at me, I helped paint it,&amp;nbsp; You helped glue the fins on.
Hey, you helped build it, not me.
There was a third comment, but I frankly didn&#39;t hear it clearly since I was helping to pack wadding and load engines into the Estes Viking rocket of kids that came to the engine table.&amp;nbsp;
The point was that in each case of malfunction, some father somewhere threw the mother under the bus.&amp;nbsp; It was one of those eyebrow&#45;raising, head&#45;cocking events that left me quietly abashed at the behavior of my father&#45;peers.&amp;nbsp; Understand that there are multiple principles that I&#39;ve come to adopt about dealing with family and kids.&amp;nbsp; The second rule &#45; and I don&#39;t have anywhere near as many as Jethro Gibbs since my memory isn&#39;t that great in the first place &#45; is that I should uphold the mother when I&#39;m dealing with the kids.&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t mean to praise her unstintingly; as the kids grow, there will likely be conversations where you have to help explain why things might have happened a certain way, and you can only hope that the mother returns the favor for you as well.&amp;nbsp; But it does mean that you treat her with the respect that you would hope you would be treated by her in your absence.&amp;nbsp; Or as happened the other day, in your presence.&amp;nbsp; Each of these separate fathers simply sloughed off the blame and threw their mate under the bus so as to avoid embarrassment.
There are several points to consider here.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s clear that American society is continuing to undergo a significant change in terms of parental gender roles for multiple reasons.

    More young men are reflecting on their own upbringing in the past twenty years and deciding that they&#39;d like to have a greater role in their kids&#39; lives than their own fathers had in their own childhood.
    More women are taking a much greater role in the workforce, removing them from the home requiring that their mate step up accordingly.
    Job losses and a poor economy &#45; notwithstanding the easy credit addiction of the crackheads on Wall Street causing a new Dow/Nasdaq highs &#45; are keeping more men at home

Despite the fact that men are now doing far more of the grocery shopping and cooking than their predecessors did, there are still some gender roles that the women don&#39;t want to see changed.&amp;nbsp; How do I know?&amp;nbsp; Because more than one mother has commented such to me through the years, especially when it comes to boy&#45;related activities.&amp;nbsp; The divorce rate through the past several decades has been in the vicinity of 50% and more than a few of the fathers fell out of the picture, leaving Mom to have to cover the activities that were historically designed for the men to handle.&amp;nbsp; This involved the handiwork activities such as building with tools as well as camping.&amp;nbsp; They themselves had grown up in a largely intact environment where Dad was around to handle such activities for the boys; they themselves were not terribly exposed to such things.&amp;nbsp; This went as well with the men; a fair portion were raised without the men to demonstrate and teach so that they didn&#39;t have the exposure to the more male&#45;oriented activities and skills.&amp;nbsp; The result is that there&#39;s a significant percentage of a parental generation without the exposure to these male&#45;oriented activities.&amp;nbsp; When it&#39;s just the Mom involved in the parenting, then she has no option but to step up and make the effort for her son.&amp;nbsp;
But what of the Dad?&amp;nbsp; I can speak from experience that any Dad wants to be respected by his kids and in an environment that prizes wise&#45;assery and irreverence, it can seem hard to keep.&amp;nbsp; My own father would never do the outdoor activities with me because of a promise that he made himself after returning from the Korean War &#45; Son, I spent a year sleeping outside with a half&#45;million Chinese trying to kill me so I&#39;ll be goddamned if I ever sleep outside again &#45; yet one of my kids thrives on the outdoor stuff.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got no option but to suck up and try to learn as I go in order to provide such an experience.&amp;nbsp; The same goes for building rockets and pinewood derby cars; outside my realm of experience but something that must be worked through to provide for the child.&amp;nbsp; My wife leaves that to my responsibility with the understanding that while I&#39;m not an expert, I&#39;ll do my best and leave it at that.&amp;nbsp;
The kids aren&#39;t stupid and they&#39;ll figure out sooner than later that Dad isn&#39;t perfect.&amp;nbsp; What matters to them however, isn&#39;t that Dad is the expert on all things male.&amp;nbsp; What matters to them is that Dad is active in their lives and doing everything that he can.&amp;nbsp; If you aren&#39;t familiar with something, then do your research beforehand and if necessary, practice out of their presence.&amp;nbsp; Practice with them and if something doesn&#39;t work right, walk through the problem so that they learn that not everything does go right the first time.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, it doesn&#39;t go right the second, third or fourth time either but if they don&#39;t see that, they won&#39;t learn otherwise.&amp;nbsp; When it goes right, celebrate.&amp;nbsp; What the kids want is your presence and attention and learning together is something that provides both in spades.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re truly not comfortable with something, then tell them why and don&#39;t feel guilty about it.&amp;nbsp; Youngest already knows that I will never take him hunting and not for reasons of conscience.&amp;nbsp; That is an activity for which I can simply not acquire sufficient expertise in time without endangering him or others.&amp;nbsp; But he does know that when his mother and I deem him old enough, we&#39;ll assure that he goes out with another father who is sufficiently competent and experienced to take a young hunter.&amp;nbsp;
Part of the old code of manhood was the ability to suck it up and shoulder your load without complaint or fault&#45;finding.&amp;nbsp; So do your best and shoulder the load.&amp;nbsp; Understand that despite the changing, shifting of the household and workplace roles, there are still some things that your mate expects that you do with the kids.&amp;nbsp; And if, after doing your best, fins fall off and rockets explode on the launch pad, nosecones fail to pop so that the rocket sails with a thwack into wet ground of the parking lot pavement, then that&#39;s simply life.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention that participating in such controlled chaos is honestly cool to experience.
Because things go wrong despite best efforts and the kids aren&#39;t learning much of a lesson with Dad throwing Momma under the bus.</body>

<title>The Conversations:&nbsp; Political</title>
<body>Despite all of the family activity over the past several months, there have been a number of significant conversations with the kids, singly or together.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s so much happening in our society &#45; well, that&#39;s nothing new but the nature of it is far more important than other issues &#45; that these conversations have to happen.&amp;nbsp; There are moments when any of them will look at me with the cocked head pose of Laddie, the Wonder Spaniel &#45; blah, blah, NSA, blah... &#45; but there are also moments when the monologue shifts to a dialogue and it&#39;s then that the real education can occur, that time when what is learned in school is fleshed out in the real world and the family values are further transmitted.
Decide what you believe is the most important for them to know and work from there.&amp;nbsp; For me, there are several large issues that come together into one overarching monstrosity of a theme.&amp;nbsp; Issues such as the legalization of marijuana, the ongoing failure to reform the financial system, the growth of the surveillance state and campaign finance reform are seemingly unrelated on one level but tightly intertwined on another level.&amp;nbsp; Each is part and parcel of the coalescence of a corporate and political structure &#45; fascism in it&#39;s simplest form &#45; that seeks to maintain itself at the cost of the individual&#39;s rights and liberties.&amp;nbsp; The legalization of marijuana is, on one level, a purported triumph for individual liberty but the system&#39;s willingness to alter decades of law and policy in the interest of yet more tax revenue is the worst form of cynicism.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve talked for years about an equal opportunity system that pays no credence to race, gender or creed and congratulations to us &#45; we&#39;re now well down the road to a system of governance that doesn&#39;t give a good goddamn about the color of your skin, your gender or what you believe so long as you feed the system via votes, tax revenues or payments for stays in private correctional facilities.</body>

<title>The Legacy for the Kids&#8230;and I&#8217;m Outraged</title>
<body>Things change a person&#39;s political perspective &#45; age, experience, education &#45; but something else that changes a political perspective is parenthood.&amp;nbsp; Through most of my young adult life, I could be classified as a socially liberal and fiscally conservative person.&amp;nbsp; I did listen to Limbaugh but spent late afternoon drivetime with NPR to get a different slant on the same topic on which Limbaugh had opined just a few hours previously.&amp;nbsp; Now I no longer listen to either but choose to get the news from a wide variety of internet sources, including foreign newspapers.&amp;nbsp; But fatherhood changed that political perspective and I&#39;m now...well, I&#39;m not entirely certain how to categorize it but it&#39;s safe to say that I&#39;m simply angry with what our political, corporate and financial sectors have become.&amp;nbsp; But while I&#39;m angry with them individually, their proto&#45;fascist collusion in the past decade or more drives me to outrage for this legacy that&#39;s being crafted for my &#45; our &#45; children.
What our nation is becoming is increasingly fascist.&amp;nbsp; The exact definition of fascism is murky, dependent upon multiple factors.&amp;nbsp; But Franklin Delano Roosevelt best described it thusly in his 1938 address to Congress on the curbing of monopolies:
The first truth is that the liberty of a  democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power  to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state  itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism&amp;mdash;ownership of Government by an  individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.

<title>The Sandwiched Generation</title>
<body>After a few rocky decades for the American father, things &#45; as least as I can tell in the media barometer &#45; seem to be leveling out.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve gone from the tasteless Al Bundy and Homer Simpson to more functional father&#45;models as demonstrated in NBC&#39;s Parenthood and ABC&#39;s Castle. &amp;nbsp; Television commercials show fully functional Dads overseeing bedtime activities and homework, as well as managing laundry.&amp;nbsp; A recent survey found that men are taking a far greater role in grocery shopping and cooking, a byproduct of more women working, fewer employment opportunities and greater interest spurred by the Food Network (a much&#45;watched network on our television).&amp;nbsp; But all of that&#39;s now happening on one end of the age spectrum, fathers and kids.&amp;nbsp; As these younger men age and the kids grow, the increasing family responsibility will begin to show itself on the other end of the age spectrum as they become responsible for one or both of their parents; they will be taking on what was historically taken on by the women in American society.
The pace of my writing since the Spring &#45; steady, but not prolific to begin with &#45; has slowed considerably in the past few months.&amp;nbsp; Part of this can be attributed to the activities and presence of kids home from school as well as the completion of years&#45;long backyard reclamation projects.&amp;nbsp; But what also took up considerable time was the reality that I was now officially a part of the sandwich generation; that phase in life in which I was not only responsible for the care of kids but also the care and oversight of an elderly parent.&amp;nbsp; Because I live much closer to that parent than my sister and my schedule is more flexible, the bulk of the oversight has fallen to me.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an experience which I never considered having to do, but then again, most of my adult life has been spent in an alternative route that was inconceivable in my youthful ambitions.&amp;nbsp; On a societal level however, it&#39;s also new because the onus of caring for the aging parents has fallen to the women, whether they be daughter or daughter&#45;in&#45;law.&amp;nbsp; The sons have typically deferred to the women because the matters fall to the purview of home management, a woman&#39;s role and one in which most men felt utterly incompetent.&amp;nbsp; But that too, is going to have to change in several ways.
First, roughly the past three American generations &#45; three 20 year generational spans, dating back to 1950 &#45; have lived and been raised in the nuclear family model of parents and their immediate children, sans grandparents.&amp;nbsp; That model broke onto the American scene in the early part of the 20th century with increasing industrialization and the rapid growth of the transport network, which allowed adult children to move for a supportable wage living with the knowledge that they could more easily get back to their own aging parents if necessary.&amp;nbsp; By the 1950s, the nuclear family was the standard model and one that worked for the country as the nation&#39;s superpower status provided expanded economic opportunity.&amp;nbsp; My own upbringing was spent four hours away from where my own parents were raised, and my experience with extended family usually consisted of a semi&#45;annual trek to the western part of the state to listen to my mother and her three siblings semi&#45;playfully trashtalk one another around the evening poker table.&amp;nbsp; If and when things with the grandmothers were problematic, much could be handled via local relatives, the social services network via phone and a trip westwards to tie up loose ends.&amp;nbsp; I say grandmothers because the grandfathers did what men of that time did, die at a much earlier age, early enough that I neven met either of them.&amp;nbsp;
This leads to the second point, which is the present disparity between the age of retirement and the age of death.&amp;nbsp; In 1950, when the nuclear family truly took flight, the average person retired at 67.3 years of age but the average age at death was 68.2 years.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations, here&#39;s your watch for years of faithful service.&amp;nbsp; Now figure out who gets it because you&#39;ve got about a half&#45;year &#39;til you get to pass that l&#39;il beauty on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By 2000, the average person&#39;s retirement age was 61.5 years and age at death, 77 years.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations, here&#39;s your watch for years of faithful service.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t sweat who gets it because you&#39;ll probably have to replace it once before you die. &amp;nbsp;In three generations, we&#39;ve gone from a retirement span of less than six months to more than 16 years &#45; and the most recent comparable statistics for retirement age are thirteen years old &#45; so there&#39;s more time that the parents have to decline in their capabilities than existed in 1950.&amp;nbsp; Medicine has progressed sufficiently that people can live for prolonged periods with conditions and diseases that would have simply killed them in 1950.&amp;nbsp; Geriatrics, the final frontier...
The third point is well known, the simple economic differences between the now retiring boomers and their 1950 peers.&amp;nbsp; The elderly are not a monolithic block, but composed of separate groups with their own generational experiences and economics.&amp;nbsp; The predecessors viewed Social Security as a supplemental income to their own savings, and many of them had pension plans that didn&#39;t have the investment timeframes facing today&#39;s surviving pension plans.&amp;nbsp; For a relatively period of time, they were financially comfortable before disease simply swept them away.&amp;nbsp; Today&#39;s boomers grew up consuming instead of saving and for them, Social Security is a primary source of income instead of a supplemental source. There&#39;s now a growing awareness of the pending shortfall in the Social Security program as America ages, and there are alternatives being batted around funding solutions.&amp;nbsp; But these would be unpopular with the wealthier citizenry and given the status of power due to wholly ineffective campaign financing regulations, passage of such measures is problematic.&amp;nbsp;
This leads to the fourth point, which is the availability of resources to assist the elderly.&amp;nbsp; My parent has sufficient assets to permit living in what is comparable to a top&#45;tier independent living community that provides for all levels of care, from independent apartments and cottages through assisted living to skilled care for end&#45;of&#45;live issues.&amp;nbsp; But this parent is a Depression&#45;era child with that generation&#39;s sensibilities of want and deprivation leading to a savings ethos to supplement the then&#45;extant pensions.&amp;nbsp; The description of life there that I hear indicate a few problems on the horizon as their clientele dies and is replaced by younger occupants; remember that the elderly are not as monolithic as AARP would like you to believe.&amp;nbsp; Apartments now seem to be unoccupied for a longer period before being sold again, and empty apartments can now be rented to residents&#39; guests for short&#45;term stays.&amp;nbsp; The food is still top&#45;notch, but there&#39;s an increasing use of chicken for protein and the once&#45;monthly Prime Rib night is a memory.&amp;nbsp; Because it&#39;s located in a rural area, the executive chef arranges for bulk purchase of greens and fruits from local farmers and seasonally, capable elderly volunteer to go to the cafeteria to help clean and prepare the produce by snapping beans or husking ears of corn.&amp;nbsp;
So the younger elders aren&#39;t as financially prepared as their predecessors.&amp;nbsp; The burden for the increased care falls upon the social net established over the past several decades by state and federal governments with a correspondingly larger demand upon the budget; but if the budget is constrained, then the result is that there&#39;s fewer dollars per elderly recipient.&amp;nbsp; If the budget is cut, then the result is an even fewer amount of money per elderly recipient.&amp;nbsp; With deficits running in the range of $1 Trillion annually and entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare comprising the lion&#39;s share of that budget, is there any real doubt that there&#39;s going to have to be a significant restructuring of the programs?&amp;nbsp; Where else will the elderly be able to turn?&amp;nbsp;
There are several things that already are &#45; or will &#45; come from this.

    The average retirement age will rise, if it hasn&#39;t already started to do so, as seniors defer retirement and remain in the workforce.&amp;nbsp; This puts pressure on the younger generations as there are fewer supportable wage jobs that permit the younger to leave their own parents&#39; houses and start their own households.&amp;nbsp;
    The retirement center model, such as my parent&#39;s, is a damaged concept as fewer elderly will be available to buy into them.&amp;nbsp; Fewer full service retirement communities will be built and those existing will have to either find new ways to deliver existing services or eliminate some of those services entirely.
    There will be increased antagonism between the younger generations and the elderly as each begins to fight for existing resources.&amp;nbsp; I honestly don&#39;t anticipate that the media will make an effort to downplay the hostility and some will even spur it since bad news and controversy sell.&amp;nbsp; Understand that there&#39;s already some hard feelings by young adults because of the manner in which the Boomer generation has managed resources and parenting; this has the potential to harden those feelings even further by a considerable degree.
    There has to be a wholesale renegotiation of the social contract between generations.&amp;nbsp; The younger have to recognize that the elderly do require assistance while the elderly have to be willing to manage on less in order to give the youngsters their own opportunities to pursue life, liberty and happiness.

&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s common to refer to those who fought and won the Second World War as The Greatest Generation.&amp;nbsp; But each generation has it&#39;s own demon with which to contend and this restructuring of our programs and resources &#45; and the accompanying pain which it will incur &#45; will be the demon for our youngsters.&amp;nbsp; My suspicion and my hope is that future generations will refer to our youngsters as The Greatest Generation, not for war, but for the sacrifices that they were forced to make to assure that all &#45; including their foolish, selfish Boomer parents &#45; received the care that they required.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; November 2013 Continues Slide&#8230;</title>
<body>...but that&#39;s only looking at one side of the family&#39;s equation.&amp;nbsp; Not only will what they have purchase less in real terms, but millions of families will actually have even less as they moved forward.
The intent of the PracticalDad Price Index has been to ascertain what&#39;s really going on with food prices via a 47 item marketbasket, followed consistently at three separate and unrelated grocery stores.&amp;nbsp; It began in November, 2010 (11/10 = 100.00) after considerable controversy over the impact of loose monetary policy courtesy of the Federal Reserve System; this or that is going up, what&#39;s going to happen to food?&amp;nbsp; But what&#39;s been happening to the average American family isn&#39;t solely the result of loose monetary policy; the middle&#45;class family has also been whacked on the income side so that they&#39;re being eaten away from two different directions.&amp;nbsp; It was an unpleasant irony that the day on which I did the price surveys was the same day that the federal SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) was cut by 6% in a budgetary move.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not as though you couldn&#39;t see one coming from months ago as the media was increasingly full of stories about fraud within the SNAP program, painting an untold number of beneficiaries as undeserving of the program; other stories told of governmental quotas for enrollment so that the administrators were graded on how many new beneficiaries joined their program during each period.&amp;nbsp; The set&#45;up was in the media to pave the public opinion way for future cuts.
The fortunate item this month is that the PracticalDad Price Index actually is dead in the water from October, 2013. The Total Index of all 47 items in the grocery store marketbasket was unchanged from October&#39;s Index of 107.83; the 37 item food component (which excludes non&#45;food items such as soap, aluminum foil and etc.) actually declined slightly to 112.81 in November from October&#39;s 112.98.&amp;nbsp; Apart from the occasional upwards month &#45; such as September&#39;s greater than half point jump to 113.76 &#45; the November Food&#45;Only Index continues the downward trend from that Index&#39;s high point of 114.33 reached in December 2012.&amp;nbsp; Note that the 37 item Food&#45;only Index had actually jumped by greater than 2.5 points from October 2012, an annualized rate in those three months of 10%; this has fortunately backed off and we&#39;re now at a level last seen in October, 2012.
So here are the results for both the Total Index and the Food&#45;only Index for the past four months.
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;Only Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread

We&#39;re now into the secular Christmas season, as judging by the lights and outdoor ornaments that I&#39;ve begun to see on local retailers and homes.&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s only November...The point to be made is this however:&amp;nbsp; I am certain that there is fraud in the SNAP program, just as there&#39;s fraud in the Social Security Disability Income program, the student loan program, Medicare/Medicaid and any number of other social/economic aid and entitlement programs.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t have more than a full generation of out&#45;of&#45;control spending &#45; coupled with a decade of (near)Zero Interest Rate Program rates &#45; without fostering a rushing stream of liquidity flowing through the economy.&amp;nbsp; That alone tempts the amoral among us, who then view the lack of regulatory enforcement enriching the highest echelons of society as an invitation to cut themselves loose to the stream and take some for themselves.&amp;nbsp; But there is a crying need for food amongst the poor and now even the middle class who are struggling; food banks are already pressed and are terrified of the long&#45;term effects of these cuts in SNAP benefits on their supplies.&amp;nbsp;
In this coming season &#45; hell, for the entire year &#45; make it a point to reallocate any charitable giving to the local food banks.&amp;nbsp; If you have the resources, purchase a bag of groceries at your shopping trip and drop it off at a nearby food bank.&amp;nbsp; The powers that be in the government and the financial sector have made it abundantly clear where their priorities lie and it&#39;s going to be up to us to take care of one another.&amp;nbsp; As my own father said to me in my teenage years, you better be able to look out for yourself because the government isn&#39;t going to do it. &amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Dads and Grocery Shopping</title>
<body>There&#39;s been a spate of recent articles (here and here) about how men are doing more of the shopping and the cooking.&amp;nbsp; There are other articles out there since things were spurred on by a research firm faxing poll results to various media outlets, but you get the drift.&amp;nbsp; Several of the articles even mention that some of these men are fathers who do most, if not all, of the cooking and one article even shows a young father carrying his preschool daughter in his arms as he rolls the cart down the aisle.&amp;nbsp; Which leads to the topic at hand, what are some things to remember if you go grocery shopping with the kid(s)?
Having been the stay&#45;at&#45;home since Eldest&#39;s birth (she&#39;s now in college) and with others at intervals back through elementary school, I&#39;ve been the one who&#39;s trotted through the grocery aisles across the years.&amp;nbsp; The majority of those years have required that I take one or more kids in tow and for several, all of them were along for the excursion; what are some things to remember and consider when the kids are along at the store?

Understand that your child is now a living, crying, potentially bleeding egg timer that&#39;s set to ring when the patience is exhausted.&amp;nbsp; Having a plan and list is crucial since your freedom to browse is now as limited as the attention span of a Labrador Retriever on meth; planning is crucial for both economic and behavioral issues.&amp;nbsp; What do you need to buy and where is it located?
Before you even leave the house, consider how much has to be accomplished and whether it can even be accomplished in the framework of your child&#39;s body clock.&amp;nbsp; Children require structure and that means a nap for most kids age three or younger so trying to accomplish a large shopping trip immediately after lunch is setting up for unpleasantries as the child simply tires and becomes unable to handle waiting in the cart.&amp;nbsp; Even kids who no longer nap still tire and are subject to the stresses of the late afternoon witching hour when their energy ebbs and they become crankier and less patient.&amp;nbsp; For me, late afternoon grocery trips were minimal and solely for emergent reasons (dammit, I thought that I had that...); some shopping was simply done in the evening by myself because it was obvious that one or more of the kids was not able to handle it that day.
Set the stage for the behavior by stating your expectations prior to even entering the store.&amp;nbsp; Talk to your toddler about what&#39;s going to happen and gently let him know what you want to see in terms of behavior; you can also let him know the consequences of misbehavior which is important if you employ the three&#45;count method of discipline (which I still do even today, to the kids&#39; general annoyance, because it continues to work).
Understand that distraction is as good as discipline for keeping small children in line.&amp;nbsp: Eldest had a toy phone that beeped and Middle had a keyring with useless keys, each of which was kept in a pocket for the moment that their patience began to wear thin.
Consider the shopping experience with your child to be an excellent teaching opportunity, particularly when they&#39;re preschoolers.&amp;nbsp; The grocery store is a great place to work on colors, shapes and names of items when they&#39;re very little and counting when they&#39;re a bit older.&amp;nbsp; How many yellow bananas are there?&amp;nbsp; One, two, three...
Let the kids help as they age; you can even turn it into a game by asking them to find certain things with prizes for reaching a certain number correct.&amp;nbsp; That said, don&#39;t send preschoolers to the other side of the store for that item that you forgot...
Make a conscious decision whether or not good behavior will be rewarded with a physical treat, such as a donut.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, you can argue that good behavior is simply expected and shouldn&#39;t be rewarded as though it was out of the norm but on the other hand, can you really turn down the opportunity for a shared donut?
Understand that you&#39;re going to be multi&#45;tasking and that the intensity of the multi&#45;task will rise with the number of children along for the jaunt.&amp;nbsp; Expect to be tired when it&#39;s finished and don&#39;t be surprised if your patience is tested.

Shopping for groceries and cooking is just one aspect of how men are continuing to step up and take a greater role in the family just as women have stepped up to take a greater role in the work force.&amp;nbsp; The experience of taking the kid(s) can be a challenge and a great shared experience and the difference between good and bad will depend upon what you expect and what you do to prepare.&amp;nbsp; Once men are more fully established in the kitchen and store, it&#39;s only going to be some years longer until they&#39;re also taking more responsibility for the housework.</body>

<title>Privacy, Kids and the NSA</title>
<body>Every generation has it&#39;s own fears and concerns for the future and this generation of parents isn&#39;t any different in that regard. &amp;nbsp;A former pastor with two sons &#45; the oldest of whom is now pushing 40 &#45; once commented that when his wife was pregnant with their first in the mid&#45;1970s, they wondered why they were even going to bring kids into that then&#45;challenged world. &amp;nbsp;But there are new challenges facing our youngsters with which previous recent generations didn&#39;t have to contend, threats which are almost existential given the youngsters&#39; electronic habits and tethers. &amp;nbsp;While I&#39;ve actively talked with the three kids about economics and civics, the ongoing disclosures about the extent of the NSA surveillance apparatus appall me and send a literal shiver through my soul. &amp;nbsp;What do I teach the kids about this and how do I help them adjust to this new threat?
Because the vast extent of the NSA and intelligence apparatus poses a threat to the heart of a free society. &amp;nbsp;It is also a dagger that cuts through the heart and soul of this young, online generation.
There are always external threats. &amp;nbsp;In the first half of the 20th century, we were threatened by fascist dictatorships and after their defeat, the mantle passed with the Cold War&#39;s onset to the communist threat. &amp;nbsp;The Soviet Bloc&#39;s implosion in the late 20th century came hand&#45;in&#45;hand with the rise of militant Islam; while terrorism has existed for decades, the ability of radical muslims to kill thousands of Americans in a single stroke awakened us to yet another threat. &amp;nbsp;There is a threat out there...but then again, there&#39;s always a threat out there.
The Presidential Oath requires him &#45; and someday, her &#45; to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. &amp;nbsp;We&#39;ve lost sight that there are also domestic enemies and not all of them wear white hoods or appear in such an obvious fashion. &amp;nbsp;My wife recently commented that everything seems to be building up and my response was that it&#39;s because we never actually resolve anything. &amp;nbsp;The budget issues aren&#39;t resolved and we kick the can down the road with continuous spending appropriations and new debt ceilings. &amp;nbsp;Trillions of dollars are generated to support an aberrant financial community but no restructuring or regulation is performed to assure that there&#39;s no repeat of 2008 (and I live with the belief that it will, and in spades the next time around). &amp;nbsp;The news cycle simply adapts itself and the old controversies are outshouted by the new and improved controversies with no resolution. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve concluded that the new domestic threats are those who wield the power to circumvent the common good, preventing critical regulatory oversight &#45; remember that one of the legitimate roles of government is to regulate the worser angels of our nature &#45; and pursuing policies that benefit corporations and legal entities but are detrimental to the individual; using money to purchase political access and votes that again, benefit the few and fictitious but are at best, neutral to the individual. &amp;nbsp;The refusal by the Obama Administration to grant a one&#45;year delay to individuals but instead giving it to corporations is a massive check engine light. &amp;nbsp;
So we&#39;ve created this pervasive, intrusive intelligence apparatus capable of giving American society a collective electronic colonoscopy. &amp;nbsp;The oversight has been minimal and as the bureaucrats push forward in their quest for security, those who question it or attempt to shed light on it are legally persecuted in the name of national security; it&#39;s not for nothing that the Obama Administration has reached new heights &#45; or lows, depending on your perspective &#45; in pursuing whistleblowers so that examples are set to discourage others of conscience. &amp;nbsp;And at the same time, the monied few with the ears and pockets of the political class continue to garner greater influence as they help the career politicians in a mutually beneficial relationship. &amp;nbsp;At what point does this relationship become the cornerstone of a new fascism, a parasitic collusion of the corporate and political classes?
And I&#39;m respectful of the arguments that support the notion that we&#39;re already there.
So what do I do to help prepare the kids? &amp;nbsp;This great steaming pile of hot mess goes to the heart of their plugged&#45;in collective consciousness, especially at a time of their lives when they&#39;re unaware both of the consequences of what they say and the reality that this is being recorded en masse and held for whatever moment is best suited for use against them? &amp;nbsp;The answers are infinitely time&#45;consuming, low&#45;tech and prosaic.

    Take every opportunity, from the earliest possible moment of their lives, to talk with them. &amp;nbsp;This sets the stage for the latter days of youth when you want to pull them aside for specific issues; they won&#39;t be looking at you like a geriatric freakshow and you won&#39;t be at an utter loss for words.
    Take every opportunity to set an example of a non&#45;wired life by putting down your own cell phone and removing your own ear buds. &amp;nbsp;In the past several months, I&#39;ve noticed more parents &#45; fathers and mothers &#45; walking the kids while plugged into an iPod or cell phone. &amp;nbsp;The concept of the daily walk is more than just taking the kid outside to blow off the stink; the concept is to fire their synapses as they grow, showing them new things and interacting with them. &amp;nbsp;They&#39;ll be more understanding of important cell phone calls when they&#39;re older if they don&#39;t see you on the damned things all of the time. &amp;nbsp;Likewise, when they&#39;re older, they&#39;ll be a bit more understanding if you ask them to remove their own.
    Raise them as skeptics, not just chatting with them, but challenging them so that they don&#39;t simply accept any party line. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve had a lifelong habit of tossing out outlandish tidbits in conversation to see whether they&#39;ll learn to challenge it as true; this isn&#39;t a harmless exercise and encouraging skepticism can come back to bite&amp;nbsp;when they&#39;re older. &amp;nbsp;
    Pull them aside to share news articles with them when they&#39;re old enough. &amp;nbsp;There have been any number of times when I&#39;ve pulled one or more kids aside to clue them in on something that I believe that they should know. &amp;nbsp;The occasional response is akin to a tilt of the head reminiscent of Laddie the Wonder Dog, but there also discussions that go places that I didn&#39;t expect. &amp;nbsp;Inform yourself and then inform them.
    Set &#45; and live with &#45; ground rules on the electronics. &amp;nbsp;Don&#39;t be afraid to turn them off and don&#39;t avoid the nastiness that comes with kids not getting their way.
    Teach them about what&#39;s private and what&#39;s not. &amp;nbsp;Teach them about family business and also about personal business. &amp;nbsp;When one of the kids takes family business outside the family, send the child away from the table the next time something sensitive is discussed, even if the other siblings remain at the table. &amp;nbsp;Then follow it up with a conversation about the excusal and you&#39;ll find it a potent lesson.
    Take them to a website with old articles or comment threads and show them comments written several years ago to prove that it doesn&#39;t go away. &amp;nbsp;
    Keep tabs on their online activity and accounts. &amp;nbsp;Tell them if they&#39;ve crossed a line and act upon it if necessary.
    Teach them to NEVER place identifying personal information online, especially a public site with exposure to many.
    Wake up yourself to the current events around you.&amp;nbsp; For this issue, follow the Electronic Frontier Foundation and read more of Glenn Greenwald in The Guardian; yeah, it&#39;s an English paper but don&#39;t look for heavy content in most domestic American papers.&amp;nbsp;

There&#39;s more at stake here than just personal information for our youngsters.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s another part of the machine that&#39;s slowly being built around us that can be used for far greater, more insidious control in the future.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t want it for myself and I certainly don&#39;t want it for my children.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; October 2013</title>
<body>Ben Bernanke will end his term as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System most noted for his now famous comment about combating deflation with a helicopter money drop if necessary.&amp;nbsp; But the monthly review of the 47 grocery items in the PracticalDad Price Index shows that significant inflation still hasn&#39;t reached the grocery stores as the October 2013 Total Index dropped very slightly to 108.35 (November 2010 = 100) and the 37 item Food&#45;only Index declined by more than .75 points to 112.98 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; On the basis of the Food&#45;only index, this is the largest decrease since the greater than 1 point drop from December 2012 to January 2013 and is the lowest level by that index since October 2012, a full year ago.
The discrepancy &#45; minimal decrease in Total Index versus significant decrease in Food&#45;Only Index &#45; is explicable.&amp;nbsp; There were six price increases offset by six price decreases amongst the 47 items; but the significant price rises were for non&#45;food items (soap at 2.7% and trash bags at 11%) while the three significant drops were in ground beef (2.4%), roaster chicken (3.1%) and apples (9.1%).&amp;nbsp;

<title>The Call</title>
<body>There are moments that freeze your parental heart, brief instants that bring forward all of the fear of what can go wrong and these moments are often affiliated with teens and driving.&amp;nbsp; Tonight was one of those instances that led to a call from my wife about Middle, who had been involved in a minor collision in a friend&#39;s car just a minute after leaving our home.&amp;nbsp; She actually came upon the accident scene when she left to join me at Youngest&#39;s baseball game, which was a shock in itself when she recognized the crunched vehicle as the one that had been sitting in our driveway just moments before.&amp;nbsp; When I answered my phone standing next to Youngest&#39;s dugout, her first words were everyone is alright; while they were meant as an immediate salve for what was to follow, the intellectual understanding was overwhelmed by the emotional recognition of what could have happened instead, what&#39;s happened to thousands of teenagers in automobiles.
When your kids leave the house and start to go into the world, there will be such calls.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll come from teachers and principals, school nurses and coaches, even from your child herself.&amp;nbsp; They might even come from a policeman on that rare and terrifying occasion.&amp;nbsp; The point is to understand that the calls will come and the best that you can do is to, as the Old Testament prophet might say, gird your loins for that moment so that you manage it well.&amp;nbsp; The only way to avoid the prospect of such calls is to keep the kids continually underfoot and dependent and that utterly defeats the job of being a parent, which is to prepare your child to take his or her place in the great wide world.&amp;nbsp;
And in the great expanse of time between those calls, continue to listen and teach, tell them that you love them and say a silent prayer when they walk out the door.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Explaining the Shutdown</title>
<body>As I sat with Middle at the kitchen island yesterday morning, I commented that this was the first day of the government shutdown.&amp;nbsp; He yanked his head upwards in surprise.&amp;nbsp; What?&amp;nbsp; How can this happen?&amp;nbsp; The conversation ensued as I explained that certain functions would certainly continue and that the world wasn&#39;t going to come to an end; the linkage was inevitably made between the rollout of the new Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare and the debt issue and how the last minute Republican spending included a year&#45;long delay in the individual policy segment of the Act.&amp;nbsp; It was here that he discovered that the Congress, in it&#39;s infinite wisdom and deep compassion, was exempt from the law and actually had its own healthcare program.&amp;nbsp;  Greedy Bastards was his simple response.
There are certainly many other aspects to the issue, difficult to parse through in short time frames and hard to keep clear and factual in light of tweets he was receiving about how the Republicans are to blame for this mess.&amp;nbsp; My response to that on the car ride to school was a succinct pox upon both parties; each has contributed mightily to the mess and neither is beyond reproach.&amp;nbsp;
But with such rancor and smoke, how do I get a factual and informative basis across to this smarter&#45;than&#45;average teen?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m certain that he&#39;d prefer to ignore it since it disturbs his zen, but his generation is going to be paying for this slow&#45;motion trainwreck and it&#39;s best that he have a clue now, sooner than later.&amp;nbsp;
The first point to remember is to keep it as factual as possible; calling a particular politician a raging cretin &#45; even if he or she is a raging cretin &#45; is certain to create a block because it&#39;s indicative that Dad&#39;s simply back on his soapbox.&amp;nbsp; Blah, blah, blah, runaway deficits, blah, blah, blah like the famous Far Side cartoon.&amp;nbsp; Dad feels better but it&#39;s rolled off with no impact whatsoever.
The second point is to actually use correct facts.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s become nigh impossible with the mainstream media cherrypicking their information, depending upon whether they&#39;re CNN, Fox or MSNBC so be prepared to go to other sources for the information.&amp;nbsp; The other aspect to this is that if he&#39;s embarrassed in front of friends, classmates and teachers because of incorrect information, then he&#39;s going to simply turn you off when you begin to talk about it.
The third point is to present it in bite&#45;sized bits.&amp;nbsp; Most parents don&#39;t spend a huge amount of time with the kids and as they age, your available time with them shortens so you have to be prepared to grab the moment and present a segment.&amp;nbsp; Kids also don&#39;t have the attention span that they might have had fifty years ago because of the prevalence of the ubiquitous electronics.&amp;nbsp; Try to squeeze in too much and you&#39;re going to reach concentration overload with many kids sooner than later.
The fourth point is to be consistent in your beliefs and conversation.&amp;nbsp; With enough time and effort, the conversation will shift from the factual to the philosophical and here&#39;s where the core of values teaching takes place.&amp;nbsp; You might not think that they&#39;re out of the zombie state yet, but they are actually thinking and working to put two&#45;and&#45;two together; if you make the effort to bring them along, many will make the effort to coalesce everything into a coherent whole.&amp;nbsp; Your inability to remain consistent in your own beliefs will simply sabotage the entire process as they will root out the inconsistencies.&amp;nbsp; And this I speak from experience as a few instances of waffling have brought forward cogent, almost surgically precise questions that made me stop and re&#45;think what I&#39;d said so that I could either clarify or, in one particular case, acknowledge that I&#39;d been wholly inconsistent.&amp;nbsp; The simple truth is that kids can smell out hypocrisy like a dog can sniff out a bone.
Issues of such complexity are not made for one&#45;off conversations.&amp;nbsp; They require multiple efforts and considerable thought, both of what was already discussed and what should be covered next to help clarify things further.&amp;nbsp; But if my job as a father is to prepare the kids for their future, then it&#39;s my responsibility to think through the process and then make the effort so that they don&#39;t suddenly awaken in ten years, upset that they didn&#39;t have a clue of what was coming.</body>

<title>Argentina and the PracticalDad Price Index</title>
<body>It&#39;s irritating that so many don&#39;t seem to realize how much of the greater world truly does impact their everyday lives, seeming to think that the world exists beyond their own cocooned existence.&amp;nbsp; We live in a world that is almost &#45; in some ways &#45; a Kevin Bacon game as what does happen elsewhere truly impacts us in ways that we don&#39;t expect.&amp;nbsp; These links go beyond the pedestrian there&#39;s yet another near&#45;war in the Middle East so oil prices are going to potentially rise  and stretch farther than we realize; things occur elsewhere that gain little notice here but can have a considerable bearing on our lives.&amp;nbsp; Such is the case when I noted an article from ABCNews.com, in which the Argentine government is criminally charging economists who challenge their reported inflation data.&amp;nbsp; My larger mental self says okay, that&#39;s eight thousand miles away and twelve miles down the rabbit hole but my smaller, more provocative mental self is far more cautionary of the news.
Let&#39;s step back a ways first, however.&amp;nbsp; Argentina is the favored poster child for images of sovereign defaults, a nation with significant resources that should be far wealthier than it is; it&#39;s a nation which has undergone revolution and a bloody military junta that kidnapped and tortured thousands of its own civilians &#45; many of whom were young adults &#45; in an effort to eradicate domestic terrorism, but wound up attacking legitimate and peaceful opposition groups.&amp;nbsp; After coming through that period several decades ago, the existant government simply confiscated the savings of the public; the Argentine middle class was literally wiped out overnight as their bank accounts simply went poof at the stroke of a governmental pen and the click of a keyboard. &amp;nbsp;Since then, the government has forced Argentines with dollars to convert them into Argentine Pesos and/or Peso denominated bonds, flooded their monetary supply with pesos in a loose accomodative policy, asked for foreign investors to participate in energy exploration while simultaneously demanding that they submit to quarterly governmental audits and most ominously &#45; like the accumulated debris of the previous actions wasn&#39;t enough &#45; been accused by multiple parties &#45; both domestic and the IMF &#45; of openly falsifying their inflation data. &amp;nbsp;The government has felt threatened enough that it&#39;s now pursuing criminal actions against a small group of economists who publicly post their own estimates as the real rate of inflation in the Argentine economy.
So what does that have to do with me? &amp;nbsp;Plenty, since I&#39;ve run a cozy, low&#45;tech monthly price index to keep tabs on the level of grocery prices for almost three years. &amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s been a growing distrust of our own government over the past decade, one that&#39;s moved out of the right wing blogosphere and directly into the middle of the American mainstream. &amp;nbsp;Part and parcel of that has been a sense amongst financial bloggers and commenters that the numbers aren&#39;t exactly as they appear; this is especially the case with the employment numbers coming out of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and their purely statistical birth/death adjustment model. &amp;nbsp;There have been more than a few months where the only improvement in the employment rate has been solely due to the application of this statistical model, followed several months by a readjustment that retroactively increases the number of unemployed Americans. &amp;nbsp;This growing skepticism has carried over to the inflation data since many can&#39;t conceive of how the Federal Reserve and US Government can respectively keep interest rates at zero bounds and still spend like a Beverly Hills housewife on a meth&#45;driven shopping bender. &amp;nbsp;Others &#45; such as John Williams Shadowstats and MIT&#39;s Billion Prices Project&amp;nbsp;&#45; have been created to keep tabs on prices, either via separate analysis of existing data or the mass accretion of global prices from online retailers. &amp;nbsp;
This PracticalDad has neither advanced degrees in Economics or Mathematics nor access to significant computing power. &amp;nbsp;What I do have is the experience of having participated in a cost&#45;of&#45;living index early in my professional life and the knowledge that comes from having shopped and cooked for a family for far more than a decade. &amp;nbsp;I could watch the fireworks and blog bullshit at the situation or actually utilize the skills and create my own index; this I did with the PracticalDad Price Index, which debuted in November 2010. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s an admittedly kitchen table affair that trades breadth of data for a grocery marketbasket of 47 separate items that is immediately understandable for the typical parent. &amp;nbsp;Other bloggers have commented that while it&#39;s interesting, it isn&#39;t national in scopeand they&#39;re right. &amp;nbsp;However, it simply provides a consistent monthly glimpse of grocery price activity in one locality. &amp;nbsp;While there are certainly price differences from one region to another, the fact is that the index monitors the change in prices from a baseline and not the prices themselves. &amp;nbsp;In the aggregate, prices rising due to factors in one region will most likely rise at a similar pace in another region. &amp;nbsp;
The Argentine government&#39;s action is cautionary in demonstrating the extent to which those in power will go to assure their continuance in power. &amp;nbsp;Our college graduates have been told that a higher education is necessary because our economy has become a knowledge&#45;based economy; the implication is that knowledge is crucial and henceforth, knowledge is power. &amp;nbsp;When true public knowledge is monopolistically controlled, those controlling it have the power. &amp;nbsp;The Argentine economists are a direct threat to those in power within the Argentine government. &amp;amp;nbsp;Will such a governmental challenge to information occur here? &amp;nbsp;Could someone like John Williams and an institution like MIT be threatened? &amp;nbsp;Could that actually happen to me and if so, what would I do? &amp;nbsp;While I frankly doubt that it could happen here, it&#39;s sobering to consider it should it actually occur and I don&#39;t know what my response would be. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s one thing to put out a datapoint, but what do you do when those in power try to erase it? &amp;nbsp;This is truly what I find so admirable about these few in the Argentine Wonderland, that they&#39;re willing to undergo the risks of speaking truth to power; a courageous act.
Of course, I never thought that I&#39;d be able to purchase depleted uranium shotgun loads for drones, either.

<title>Teaching The Ugly Realities:&nbsp; 9/11</title>
<body>Parents want to protect their kids, not only from harm, but also from the knowledge of some of the terrible things that occur in contemporary society.&amp;nbsp; We might discuss such things when they age, but a picture is worth a thousand words and no amount of classroom or dinner&#45;table discussion can bring home the impact of what occurred and it&#39;s unclear when the kids might be ready for a more visceral examination of an event.&amp;nbsp; Such was the question in this household as I pondered whether Youngest was now old enough to view a CBS news documentary &#45; What We Saw &#45; issued about a year after the attacks.
The documentary is a 2002 hardcover book with accompanying DVD that relates the events of 9/11, commencing with Bryant Gumbel&#39;s morning interview with a witness to a purported plane collision with the first of the two towers.&amp;nbsp; It then moves through the rest of the day as New York and Washington, DC reel from the events, and further recounts the actions of the passengers on United&#39;s Flight 93 as they willingly sacrificed themselves and took the plane into a remote Pennsylvania field.&amp;nbsp; The scenes of the devastation are still frightening and visceral to watch; in one news clip, a person opts to jump to his death instead of burning alive atop one of the towers and we can watch this poor soul plummet for hundreds of feet before a nearby building mercifully hides his final impact from our view.&amp;nbsp; Not everything is grisly and there are segments on the ensuing rescue efforts, patriotism and the resultant move into Afghanistan in search of the now dead Bin Laden.&amp;nbsp; It was a book that I purchased years ago precisely for the purpose of showing to the kids when they were old enough to more fully take in its meaning, and it was shown to each of the older two kids when I deemed them old enough.
But was Youngest now old enough?&amp;nbsp; At the time of the attacks, he was still in utero; he has spent his entire life in the shadow of those attacks and all that&#39;s changed since then.&amp;nbsp; There is no understanding of life before the TSA, drones and a constant threat &#45; real or imagined &#45; of terrorism.&amp;nbsp; The seemingly ever&#45;present surveillance camera was far less prevalent and we didn&#39;t seem to be living with a sense of constantly impending menace.&amp;nbsp; Youngest has certainly known about the attacks from his mother and I, school and the media, but he&#39;d never been exposed to the visual panoply of that time.&amp;nbsp; Making it an even harder question is that we&#39;ve tried &#45; and never fully succeeded &#45; to keep him away from the graphic violence that permeates video games and the media.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s certainly seen violent movies, although rarely until this past year, but we&#39;ve made efforts to keep the graphic combat games away and there is no &#45; for now, but that will change &#45; game system in the house.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that he hasn&#39;t become desensitized to the violence that permeates our environs.&amp;nbsp; This was brought home two years when I finally allowed him to watch the first part of Saving Private Ryan and he only lasted through the initial assault on Omaha Beach before having to stop watching.
The boy has an interest in history and the world around him, and preparing him and his siblings for the world is my principal role as a father.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s become an increasingly ugly world, one in which terrorists kill others for media coverage, the deranged arm themselves to hunt for our most vulnerable and schools now openly discuss what to do in the event that a gunman comes strolling down the main hallway.&amp;nbsp; Given his interest, his maturity and the nature of how we&#39;ve had to adapt, I opted to share the DVD with him years before I did so with his older siblings.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d watch for a few minutes and then he&#39;d pause the program to ask a question or listen to an explanation I&#39;d offer for something that was on&#45;screen.&amp;nbsp; It was a brutal experience and there were moments when I wept along with him as we viewed the CBS news reports until we could watch no further, ultimately turning it off midway through the program.
Our job as parents is to prepare our children to make their way in the world.&amp;nbsp; This means that we must pay attention to the world around us so that we can adjust plans and actions to fit the times, and what might have worked for an older child might have to be re&#45;evaluated  for the younger kids that follow.&amp;nbsp; It also means that we must be personally involved teaching these things, as uncomfortable as they might be.&amp;nbsp; We cannot leave the lessons for the schools alone, and we certainly shouldn&#39;t leave them to the media culture; the children require a sense of context to help them make full sense of what they see and we parents are the ones who can best provide that background and context for them.&amp;nbsp; We know how they process information and whether or not they&#39;re ready for the more unpleasant lessons of life around us.</body>

<title>When School Technology Programs Affect Family Policy</title>
<body>The letter from the local high school came in the mail two weeks before first day of classes, amidst an assortment of administrative odds and ends, and I frankly didn&#39;t catch it&#39;s significance until after the new school year began.&amp;nbsp; What prompted me to go back and review it again was a comment from Middle, who&#39;s now in high school; he remarked that he&#39;d be getting a laptop in January and when I responded that it was unlikely, he told me that it was being given to all high school students as the start of a new &quot;1 to 1&quot; program.&amp;nbsp; This news was problematic since we&#39;ve made it a point to not provide the kids with their own laptops until going off to college and this was what happened with Eldest, who received a laptop as a graduation present in May of her senior year.&amp;nbsp; This was compounded a day later by Youngest&#39;s comment that they &#45; his sixth grade class &#45; had been told that they could now bring in their smartphones, laptops and iThingies starting in the Fall in order to also access the web with their teachers.&amp;nbsp; Because we do try to control the level of access and amount of screen time, Youngest has none of these devices.&amp;nbsp; So...what to do when the family technology policy collides squarely with the policy initiatives of the local school district?
This initiative revolves around grant money that can be used to purchase inexpensive laptops for the high school students.&amp;nbsp; In January, 2014, each district high school student will receive a new laptop, to be used throughout their secondary education period and afterwards, each class of incoming freshmen will receive the same for their four year period.&amp;nbsp; The rationale for this program is the letter&#39;s reference to the opportunity for students to now take full advantage of all that technology offers in terms of educational opportunity and there are certainly good reasons for such an investment.&amp;nbsp; The presence of the laptops permits faculty to direct their students to a much broader scope of information available through the internet, potentially opening more young minds to possibilities.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, it&#39;s &quot;green&quot; and there is far fewer paper used and far more trees saved.&amp;nbsp; A more prosaic reason is that with more resources available online, even textbooks, the school has less cost for school supplies.&amp;nbsp; Wow, someone else&#39;s money for a one&#45;time investment and X% of our own costs go away...For The Win, Baby!
While it&#39;s a win for the school district, it&#39;s both a question and just one more thing to monitor within the household.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re not Amish by any means and there&#39;s certainly screen time going on within the household, but it&#39;s been a conscious decision and ongoing effort to create family guidelines, monitor activity and enforce limits regarding electronics.&amp;nbsp; The remaining two kids in the household &#45; Middle and Youngest &#45; are definitely behind the curve from an electronics standpoint as there are no game systems, iThingies or smartphones although Middle now possesses a cell phone to match his driver&#39;s permit.&amp;nbsp; There are families for whom this particular policy initiative would be a dealbreaker, family policy now ostensibly being dictated by a public entity; there are some &#45; admittedly a very few &#45; who would opt instead for a different route of education and pursue either a private institution or else homeschooling.&amp;nbsp; The irony in this situation would be that a considerable amount of homeschooling is now done via cyberschool, in which case a separate computer might also have to be purchased for the student.
So, what to do?&amp;nbsp; Homeschooling isn&#39;t an option here since we do find great value in public education, apart from the academics alone; although I&#39;m annoyed from reading the letter that this program was taken on after considerable reflection by staff and faculty with no mention of parental involvement.&amp;nbsp; The best that we can do, if we&#39;re to stay within the system, is to simply shoulder the burden of amending the house rules and continuing to uphold them as best we&#39;re able.&amp;nbsp; In Middle&#39;s case, the laptop will have to be used in common areas and out of the bedroom; free surfing will have to occur on the family computer as before and I&#39;ll wind up having to check more often to assure that the technology isn&#39;t being overused.&amp;nbsp; Youngest&#39;s case is different however.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve known that many more of his friends have unfettered access to the web, both in terms of their personal devices as well as parental oversight and we aren&#39;t willing to provide him with a device despite what the school is now offering for the nascent middle&#45;schoolers.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s bad enough that I&#39;m now going to have to add one more piece of technology to the list, but adding another for Youngest is unacceptable&gt;&amp;nbsp; What Youngest&#39;s teacher did advise was that any device with a wireless capability would work, including a Nook HD or Amazon&#39;s Kindle Fire and that presents an option; not that we&#39;re going to purchase one for him but one for the family that could be taken to school during the day but would be returned to the kitchen upon returning home...in other words, mine.
This initiative isn&#39;t something that&#39;s going to break our relationship with the school district, and the simple truth is that it will probably be of value.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s not an innocuous change and has a direct bearing upon how we&#39;ve heretofore chosen to raise the kids and run the household.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of other changes that school districts roll out and the cumulative effect of some of these programs has been to push parents into disaffection with the public system, sometimes to the extent that they simply withdraw their children and seek other educational alternatives.&amp;nbsp; I can intellectually understand their discomfort but there hasn&#39;t been anything to date that has actually made me sit back and say hmmm... and while this one isn&#39;t a dealbreaker, the understanding has now shifted from the academic and intellectual realm to that of the real world, the one that we inhabit each day.</body>

<title>Youth and Political Apathy:&nbsp; Can You Blame Them?</title>
<body>There are still some of us who &#45; despite all of the unalloyed stupidity, graft and cynical machinations &#45; still believe in this whole government of the people, by the people, and for the people schtick.&amp;nbsp; We want and try to raise our kids to pay attention to events, form educated opinions and engage in the political process, even if only to vote when they&#39;re old enough.&amp;nbsp; But the chronic incompetence of recent sitting Presidents and Congress make it impossible to want to do so, let alone try.&amp;nbsp; The recent picture of Senator John McCain playing poker on his smartphone  simply drives me over the edge of indifference; the Senator &#45; who long ago and far away had my respect &#45; was sitting in the Senate Committee hearing on the President&#39;s proposed use of force in Syria and decided to take a little break by playing poker.
Seriously?&amp;nbsp; Seriously?&amp;nbsp; While my Youngest is still in elementary school, I&#39;m old enough that some of Eldest&#39;s peers now serve in the Armed Forces and any of them could be sent overseas because of this business.&amp;nbsp; Yet a senior Senator sits in the hearing regarding their future, playing electronic poker; the fact that this is the guy who spent years as a prisoner of war makes it mind&#45;boggling in the extreme.&amp;nbsp; Being a parent means that at some level, the kids&#39; friends &#45; who I&#39;ve historically referred to as the Opies &#45; become young adults with their own discernible dreams, hopes and wishes.&amp;nbsp; Some of them virtually become our own kids and their safety and welfare matters as much as that of our own offspring.&amp;nbsp; The fact that senior senators are sitting around during the hearings hoping to draw a flush is not only insensitive to those of us who give a damn, it&#39;s insulting.
The great majority of adults reach an age at which they understand that there&#39;s a difference between the ideal and the reality.&amp;nbsp; We know that money and power come into play but hope &#45; with some sufficient pressure applied &#45; that these elements are somehow offset by a sense of the public good and simple common sense.&amp;nbsp; Yet the survival of a democracy is based ultimately on optimism; not the saccharine Hallmark&#45;card variety, but the elemental optimism which believes that the great majority of people are decent sorts, able to put aside their differences and live in some degree of peace with one another.&amp;nbsp; We can teach about our form of government in school &#45; and that&#39;s not going too well, either &#45; but this core belief is one that, like so many other beliefs, is passed along as much through the quiet conversation and personal interaction that occurs daily in the home.&amp;nbsp; Contemporary American society is crass and cynical and I freely admit that I&#39;m trying to raise my kids to be skeptics.&amp;nbsp; But such a deep&#45;rooted optimism requires continual nurturing in the face of the crap that our politicians throw around like so many chimps with their feces, and the Senator&#39;s hope for a flush crosses a boundary that is deeply offensive on a personal level.&amp;nbsp; Man, there&#39;s actual use of chemical weapons and now there&#39;s the prospect of sending them to the sandbox &#45; again.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the evidence for this and more importantly, do I trust a government that provided manipulated information for a previous trip to the sandbox?&amp;nbsp; I only hope that the leadership is paying atten...no, wait.&amp;nbsp; Nevermind.
Idiots.
Any good politician knows that politics is a fusion of substance and imagery and that the latter can trump the former.&amp;nbsp; The 1988 image of presidential nominee Michael Dukakis in a tank was as much a killer as the fictitious image of Abraham Lincoln splitting rails was a winner.&amp;nbsp; But the image of a senior senator playing smartphone poker like a high schooler in the back row of Civics class is damaging.&amp;nbsp; It not only portrays McCain in a poor light, but reinforces the notion amongst the public that the political leadership is not only cynical, but callous towards the ramifications of the actions that they are &#45; or aren&#39;t &#45; about to take.&amp;nbsp; McCain acknowledged in a subsequent tweet that he was indeed playing poker &quot;during a 3+ hour Senate hearing&quot; yet the tweet is meant derisively: yeah, I did it but geez, it was three hours of bloviation and if you&#39;d been there, you might have done it, too.&amp;nbsp; The Arizona Senator&#39;s behavior during and after the hearing is a gross, immense action of unabashedly immature stupidity and when I&#39;ve heard similar exculpatory flatulence come from the mouths of any of my three kids, I&#39;ve dope&#45;slapped them, Gibbs&#45;style, across the back of their heads.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t rambling about the tax code, but a matter of the use of force and after previous administrations&#39; efforts in 2001 and even earlier, in 1964&#39;s Gulf of Tonkin resolution &#45; and that one led to the Vietnam War &#45; the public deserves better.
Public upset over this will pass quickly since the American public has a short attention span and memory.&amp;nbsp; But while the exact instance will pass, there will be a corrosive after&#45;effect.&amp;nbsp; The cost of running for, and gaining, office is now prohibitive to the average American and assumes dollar amounts that are not attainable for Joe and Jane Six&#45;pack and there&#39;s already a belief that to gain office requires more than a little duplicity to please the backers who pay the freight for their pet candidate.&amp;nbsp; One of the goals of the nascent Occupy movement was to grab the attention of the politicians via demonstration and sit&#45;in and that did seem to work until the movement imploded.&amp;nbsp; But the corrosive element is not only that the political classes are no longer like us, but that they simply don&#39;t care about the typical American&#39;s needs.&amp;nbsp; That was the knock painted against the Republicans but it&#39;s increasingly the same knock laid against Democrats, many of whom are also independently wealthy in their own right.&amp;nbsp; Lifetime pension?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; Lifetime healthcare?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; Access to inside information that can be used for personal gain?&amp;nbsp; ah yep, check.&amp;nbsp;  It is this behavior that drives home the point that the government really doesn&#39;t care about the public, and drives Americans away from the system.&amp;nbsp; The internal intelligence apparatus has grown to massive proportions and the reports about the extent of domestic electronic surveillance foster a sense of helplessness amongst the public, and Americans cocoon themselves in the hope that they&#39;ll be left alone by this whatever&#45;it&#45;is that we&#39;ve constructed.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s difficult enough fighting through the societal noise to raise kids that both understand and care about the political process; when the public behaviors are so stupidly callous that they discourage and dishearten the parents who are trying to wage this fight, then the Congress has only itself to blame for the image and we ourselves for the political results.&amp;nbsp;
There is true irony here.&amp;nbsp; John McCain&#39;s persona is intimately tied to the tortures that he endured as an American prisoner&#45;of&#45;war in the Vietnam conflict.&amp;nbsp; That conflict was an undeclared war, but then&#45;President Johnson was provided political cover by a Congress that passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964 on what is now known to be questionable information.&amp;nbsp; Were the existant Congressmen of that year paying full attention to what was happening, or was their attention engaged elsewhere?&amp;nbsp; And what would then&#45;Lieutenant McCain have thought &#45; in Hanoi &#45; had there been proof that the civilian leadership responsible for the Resolution&#39;s passage spent their time in Chambers playing poker instead of attention?</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Moving Again in September 2013</title>
<body>PracticalDad note:  After an odd summer, I&#39;m officially back and the writing will again pick up.  Thanks for reading...
After an eight month period of decline, the PracticalDad Price Index rose by half a percentage point to 108.39 (All Items Index) and 113.76 (Food&#45;only Index) in September 2013. &amp;nbsp;
Since it&#39;s inception in November, 2010, the 47 grocery item PracticalDad Price Index rose until it peaked in December 2012 at an index level of 108.07 for all items and 114.33 for the separate Food&#45;only items index (November 2010 = 100). &amp;nbsp;In layman&#39;s terms, the prices were 8.07% and 14.33% higher than at the index creation. &amp;nbsp;But after the December 2012 peak &#45; which itself was a full percentage point rise from November 2012 &#45; the indices dropped; by August 2012, the Food&#45;only index was 113.14, more than a full percentage point below the peak eight months previously. &amp;nbsp;But after this decline, the prices are starting to move upwards again in September 2013; it&#39;s as if a car were spinning tires wildly and accelerating quickly after they gained purchase on the wet roadway.
One of the items that I was watching from the August 2013 Price Index&amp;nbsp;was the cost of beef, since the size of the cumulative national herd was at levels not seen in decades. &amp;nbsp;Sure enough, the cost of a pound of 80% ground rose by 2.5% over the month and I&#39;ll continue to watch. &amp;nbsp;What has been fascinating about the process is seeing how grocers are finding new, lower cost food suppliers when they believe that their market can no longer absorb price increases. &amp;nbsp;September was another instance in which a single store found a new supplier for a generic product; a grocer&#39;s generic box of spaghetti &#45; still at 16 ounces instead of the stealth adjusted 12 ounce box from one national producer &#45; dropped from $1.29 to $1.00/box, a 22% drop. &amp;nbsp;This is on the heels of previous drops, since November 2010, in products like tomato sauce, diapers and women&#39;s pads. &amp;nbsp;But the monthly indices are still up a half percentage point, despite this downward adjustment.
The results of the past four months are as follows:
Month/Year &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Total Index &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Food&#45;Only Index &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Spread

<title>&#8220;Inflation is low now, but could be excessive in the future&#8221;</title>
<body>And that is the headline from a post on cnbc.com.&amp;nbsp; The comment is attributed to Federal Reserve Governor Bullard, and the story is so developing that as of this writing, there&#39;s no actual story attached with the caveat that it&#39;s &quot;developing&quot;.
Gee, y&#39;think, DiNozzo?
That a comment like that would come from a Federal Reserve Governor is stunning, a recognition that present policies are a set&#45;up to a potential inflationary event that&#39;s inimical to it&#39;s long&#45;held policy standard of price stability.&amp;nbsp; The theory is that the ongoing rounds of Quantitative Easing will throw enough digital money to the banks &#45; which should theoretically lead to actual physical cash amongst the public &#45; floating through the economy that spending increases, leading to greater economic activity and recovery.&amp;nbsp; Despite all of the controversy about inflation versus deflation, the evidence from my small PracticalDad Price Index is bolstered by the recent Walmart news release that Q2 (2013) comparable store sales were flat partially due to low inflation</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index. August 2013 - Prices Remain Flat</title>
<body>You&#39;d think that with the kids growing, there&#39;d be more time to write but a week camping with scouts, the need to finish multiple projects &#45; and a larger foray into the generational sandwich &#45; has left less time to spend on the site. &amp;nbsp;Oh well, life intrudes.
But there&#39;s always time to roll through the same three grocery stores to pull together the 47 item marketbasket data for the PracticalDad Price Index. &amp;nbsp;The results however, reveal little change from the July index level as the August Total Index rose to 107.90 from July&#39;s 107.57 (November 2010 = 100). &amp;nbsp;When the Food&#45;Only Index of 37 items is considered, the index was essentially flat with August at 113.14 versus the July result of 113.13 (again, November 2010 = 100). &amp;nbsp;There&#39;s honestly little notable about the results, but I&#39;ll be watching the ground beef prices as drought in Texas and the lower midwest has caused ranchers to decrease the herd levels not seen since 1952. &amp;nbsp;The offset is that rain in the upper midwest has caused a rebound in corn and hog output. &amp;nbsp;
The results of the past four months are as follows:
Month/Year &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Total Index &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Food&#45;Only Index &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Spread

8/13 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;107.90 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 113.14 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 5.24
The simple reality is that for all of the discussion about incipient inflation, the index for 47 commonly purchased grocery items (seen here) is simply flat and has been so since reaching a peak in December 2012.</body>

<title>My Greatest Fear for the Kids</title>
<body>The issues are piling up like bodies after an earthquake. &amp;nbsp;Coherent domestic energy policy? &amp;nbsp;No. &amp;nbsp;Coherent campaign finance reform? &amp;nbsp;Nah. &amp;nbsp;Rational gun control programs (and yes, I belong to the NRA)? &amp;nbsp;Nuh&#45;uh. &amp;nbsp;The inability of the political sector to even remotely regulate the financial sector? &amp;nbsp;Um, nope. &amp;nbsp;We live in a short attention&#45;span society driven by a 24 hour news cycle, in which shouting takes the place of dialogue and any discernible movement towards real consensus and action is seemingly impossible. &amp;nbsp;In this take&#45;no&#45;prisoners environment, we&#39;ve lost the ability to compromise. &amp;nbsp;But of all the issues out there, the one issue that literally leaves me breathless at its ramifications for my children is that of the NSA&#39;s domestic electronic surveillance programs. &amp;nbsp;This policy is the one thing that scares me when I think of their future.
My goal is that the kids have an understanding of the world in which they not only live but of the world into which they&#39;re moving.&amp;nbsp; Through the years and despite the technological changes, the constant is human behavior and how processes work.&amp;nbsp; I try to assure that the conversations flow about different topics but the reality is that different topics flow better with some kids than others due to age and interest, and occasionally whether or not I&#39;m holding up something else they deem more important in order to cover something that I believe that they need to hear.&amp;nbsp; Yeah Dad, I get it...the goal is to separate us from our wallet contents, now can we please go?&amp;nbsp; Subjects flow from economics to politics to anything else that seems to be either relevant or interesting, whatever is current or is important that they understand.&amp;nbsp;  Fracking?&amp;nbsp; check. Fiat money and the Federal Reserve?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; What is this ISIS thing in Iraq and why doesn&#39;t it have something to do with Archer?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; How is it that a Stinger launcher that we ostensibly provided to Syrian rebels, who are only moderate Al Qaeda fanatics versus the fanatical Al Qaeda fanatics, seem to have migrated through various conduits so that they wind up in the Messerschlitz garage down the street and launched to celebrate this most recent 4th of July?&amp;nbsp; check.&amp;nbsp; Stupidity is run amok.

<title>Just What Is Inflation Anyway?</title>
<body>It&#39;s been more than five years since the start of the ongoing financial mess and one blogger, Jesse, was spot on in his description of this period as reminiscent of Samuel Beckett&#39;s Waiting For Godot.&amp;nbsp; While he was commenting on waiting for the arrival of any real recovery, the analogy holds for the controversy of inflation versus deflation and price stability.&amp;nbsp;Contemporary American economic policy is predicated upon three points:  first, that any policy actions have to be monetary in nature since the fiscal policy mechanism &#45; Congress and the budget &#45; &amp;nbsp;is simply broken; second, that flooding the economy with sufficient liquidity will ultimately spur enough activity to jumpstart consumer spending; third, that the financial sector &#45; which really controls monetary policy since the Federal Reserve System is actually privately owned by the constituent member banks &#45; should be protected from its errors and ultimately enriched by siphoning off from the liquidity that flows first through it&#39;s conduits and pipelines.&amp;nbsp; The near&#45;economic collapse on the heels of Lehman&#39;s failure in 2008 was deflationary and everything that&#39;s been done since is designed to be inflationary.&amp;nbsp; But since everyone&#39;s talking about inflation, what precisely is it and how will we know it if and when it arrives...assuming that it hasn&#39;t already?
Inflation is essentially a decrease in the value of any currency, as measured by it&#39;s ability to purchase goods and services; likewise, deflation could loosely be considered an increase in the ability of any currency to purchase goods and services (although a deflationary environment often exists in tandem with periods of economic depression).&amp;nbsp; But there are multiple causes of rising prices and they can arise from different circumstances and in a massive economy with billions of transactions daily, it&#39;s possible for prices of different items to rise and decline simultaneously.&amp;nbsp; But to say that a price increase is inflationary is too simplistic since the key component of an inflationary environment is the amount of liquidity in the economic system.&amp;nbsp; For example, if I attend a charity auction and wind up in a bidding war with two others for a handmade quilt, the price of the item will rise but that doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re living in an inflationary environment.&amp;nbsp; The next item that comes up for bid might not even sell; it proves that no one wanted the item, not that there&#39;s deflation.
So what are sources of rising prices?

    Demand is what occurs to prices of items when there are enough buyers in the marketplace to bid up the price for a particular item, whether it&#39;s a Beanie Baby or a Bugatti.&amp;nbsp; This is the situation that producers like because it means that there&#39;s sufficient money in the system that people have it to spend and more importantly, they can control the prices (and profit margins) for their items.&amp;nbsp; This is the environment that the Federal Reserve seeks to spur with loose monetary policy such that people believe that they have enough that they can spend, producers can sell and in turn, expand and hire others which then creates even more jobs in a positive cycle.
    Supply&#45;shock is what occurs when there&#39;s a shortage of a particular item with no immediate lessening of demand so that the item&#39;s owner/producer can raise the price.&amp;nbsp; The immediate onset of the 1973 Arab oil embargo is a classic example of pricing when the supply is sundered.&amp;nbsp; In that instance, the Arab producers significantly cut sales to the United States so that drivers had to pay increased prices for the remaining gasoline stocks.&amp;nbsp; In this case, the oil embargo was inflationary because the effects of the fuel shortage rippled through the entire economy and affected the great majority of other products due to increased transportation costs.&amp;nbsp;
    Hyper&#45;inflation is the scenario about which many doomers despair because the value of a currency drops significantly and occasionally, cataclysmically as it loses all value whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; This scenario is a result of political actions as well as economic circumstances and is best known from the German Weimar Republic experience of the early 1920s and Zimbabwe&#39;s implosion in the 1990s.

What worries most economic pundits about the actions of the Federal Reserve is what could occur because of the vast increase in the liquidity by that entity.&amp;nbsp;
The best way to understand inflation is to consider Irving Fisher&#39;s &amp;quot;Equation of Exchange&amp;quot;, MV = PT.&amp;nbsp; In this equation:
M = Money Supply, in its various forms such as cash/coin, demand deposits (checking accounts), money market funds, et cetera;
V = Velocity of Money, or literally how many times a dollar is turned over as it flows through the economy for a specified period of time (the higher the velocity, the greater the economic activity while a lower or dropping figure indicates that activity is slowing and folks are moving dollars to their mattresses, as literally occurred during the Great Depression);
P = Prices;
T = Number of Transactions that occur during a specified period of time (although some economists have substituted Y &#45; real income &#45; in lieu of T).
While there&#39;s been well&#45;deserved criticism of economists because of their drive to wrap a soft&#45;science, human behavior oriented center in a crunchy hard&#45;science shell, the Equation of Exchange does permit a decent macro level examination of some very large variables.&amp;nbsp; In this case, it certainly is enhanced since you can control for the effects of fiscal policy due to it&#39;s simple present non&#45;existence, which leaves Fisher&#39;s equation as a decent starting point.&amp;nbsp;
The left side of the equation pertains to the variables of monetary policy in it&#39;s most elemental aspects, the supply of money provided by the monetary officials (M) and the corresponding use of money by the public (V).&amp;nbsp; The right side of the equation is composed of the dependent variables affected by the variables on the left:&amp;nbsp; aggregate price levels (P) and the number of transactions, although honestly, I&#39;ll use Y (real income) since that information is readily available.&amp;nbsp;
Given these highly simplified variables, what should occur when either or both the Money Supply and Velocity variables is altered?&amp;nbsp; Think of it as closed system, akin to an engineering situation; the money supply on the left is a supply of water and the velocity is heat added to the system while the two variables on the right are gauges that indicate the effect of the water and heat.&amp;nbsp; If we increase either the water or the heat, the effect should be greater pressure in the system, either from steam or the sheer quantity of water that applies pressure to the system.&amp;nbsp; If we decrease either the water or the heat, there should be a corresponding decrease in the system.&amp;nbsp; In this particular case, if the money supply (M) increases and there&#39;s little change in the velocity (V) of money &#45; again, velocity is an indicator of how readily people are willing to spend money &#45; then there should be some increase in either prices (P) or income (Y).&amp;nbsp; There can certainly be offsetting movements in either prices or income, but one and/or the other should be affected to the upside.
So what exactly has occurred in the past five years with our two variables, M and V?&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s not surprising that the Federal Reserve has injected an almost 50% increase in liquidity into the economy since late 2007, so M has risen almost 50%.&amp;nbsp; But while M has risen, the velocity of money &#45; how often money turns over in the system &#45; has dropped by about a quarter during that same time frame, from a little over 2X to about 1.56X as of late February, 2014.&amp;nbsp; So the money supply has risen but the amount that people are spending has dropped.
On the other side of the equation, it&#39;s clear that the median family income (Y) has dropped significantly both since the start of the 2007 recession and even further since 1999.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a certain link that velocity has dropped because people are spending less because of the decline in family income.&amp;nbsp; But if the money supply has risen so much, offsetting the velocity decline, and it isn&#39;t showing up in family incomes, does that mean that it&#39;s occurring in the Price (P) variable?
Well, that depends on who you are and whether you&#39;re one of the 1%,&amp;nbsp; From where I sit, not only has income growth split so that the 1% prospers while the remainder decline, but that&#39;s what is occurring with inflation as well.&amp;nbsp; Inflation is now bifurcated as well.&amp;nbsp; To gain a perspective, go back to the closed system analogy from several paragraphs earlier.&amp;nbsp; That analogy still holds, but now consider that the water has to be injected into the system in the first place and the plumbing conduit for the pipes is essentially the financial sector for the national economy because in the real world, the banking system is the conduit through which the Federal Reserve injects liquidity into the economy.&amp;nbsp; Knowing and understanding that the banks are akin to a liquidity supply for the (almost) closed system, what&#39;s happening in the analogy is that there&#39;s a diversion in the conduit so that more than a fair share of all of that liquidity is being diverted to another system, this one owned and operated by the banks.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Reserve is injecting trillions of dollars via quantitative easing but much is being siphoned off by the banks for their own use instead of making it to the real economy.
So what&#39;s happening with the money that&#39;s now powering through this parallel &#45; and powerful &#45; system?
First, understand that one of the primary jobs of the banking system is to spread money throughout via lending.&amp;nbsp; Yet for all of the recovery talk since 2007, bank loan creation has been essentially moot.&amp;nbsp; So what&#39;s been happening with all of that money siphoned off from the Federal Reserve quantitative easing injections?&amp;nbsp; The banks have been able to put it in deposit with the Federal Reserve as a means to help repair the damage that they did to themselves from the 2007 Financial Crisis.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s held with the Fed draws a .25% interest rate and while that&#39;s only nominally better than the .1% that my kids get on their passbook savings, it&#39;s a chunk of change when you&#39;ve got deposits in the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars.&amp;nbsp; This money also serves as the support for all of the proprietary trading that&#39;s done on the commodities and stock markets by the banks, now permitted because of the repeal of the 1933 Glass Steagall Act which was passed to keep the banks from playing with money like a couple of gamblers with a briefcase full of blow.&amp;nbsp; The rise of the various American equity markets &#45; Dow, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 &#45; can be linked clearly to the impact of the effect of banks playing the markets with money siphoned off from the QE injections that were to go to the real economy.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this &quot;hot money&quot; that has also fueled the periodic run&#45;ups in commodity prices over the past five years, as financial folks look &#45; running around like meth&#45;addicted terriers &#45; for asset&#45;backed investments in which to park the money for the period until that bubble pops; if you&#39;d like a decent &#45; and interesting &#45; read on this, go to this final Rolling Stone article by Matt Taibbi.
So this diversion of liquidity from the Fed to the economy is leading to bifurcated pricing that matches the bifurcated incomes...Fed&#45;desired inflation for the 1% and deflation for the 99%.&amp;nbsp; Top&#45;tier inflation is borne out in several ways.&amp;nbsp; First, there&#39;s inflation in the financial asset prices as the institutions use the Fed&#45;provided support to move the stock markets to historic levels, honestly unsupported by the activity within the real economy underpinning them.&amp;nbsp; As incomes drop, people cash out or borrow against their retirement funds and velocity drops, the market rises are wholly a result of the liquidity injections.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s also inflation in the aforementioned commodity prices as the hot money flows in search of new and interesting avenues of return.&amp;nbsp; The producers of high&#45;end luxury items note that sales continue at respectable levels and they&#39;re able to maintain &#45; and even increase &#45; prices as those with the income growth are able to spend their money on the items marketed to them.&amp;nbsp; On the flip side, mass retailers such as Walmart are openly warning of the collapse in their customers&#39; spending because of the squeezed incomes.&amp;nbsp; Because lending has been a non&#45;factor and there&#39;s been no growth, the 99% system is now losing steam simply because there&#39;s not enough money coursing through and it&#39;s declining until a newer, more stable level of activity is supportable.
It sounds reasonable in a clinical sense, but finding this new level involves foreclosures, more American families having to go on food stamps and the prospect of hunger and harsh choices for more and more Americans.
Since November 2010, I&#39;ve run a grocery price index with a market&#45;basket of 47 items and it&#39;s been demonstrating deflation for the better part of a year, most especially since late 2013.&amp;nbsp; The market&#45;basket index began as a single index of the 47 items and was later split into two indices, the first for the original basket and then a second for the 37 actual food items within that market&#45;basket.&amp;nbsp; These indices have both dropped from their all&#45;time highs in December 2012.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;m seeing now as I do the monthly pricing on these items is an actual price decline in some items as grocers are finding ways to cut prices in order to maintain sales that allow them to stay in business.&amp;nbsp: Stealth inflation &#45; holding profit margins by selling smaller amounts while maintaining the same price &#45; will continue to occur, but there are now specific instances of grocery price declines and in significant ways.&amp;nbsp; Cans of kidney beans and various canned vegetables have dropped and I&#39;ve even found an instance of stealth deflation as a grocer actually increased the size of a can of generic coffee while maintaining the price (although not back to the original 2010 package size).&amp;nbsp; The unrelated stores that I survey monthly are each now showing one or more instances of declining prices; I don&#39;t price at Trader Joes or Whole Foods, but I doubt that this is price activity that we&#39;d find at such upscale markets.&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s the Fed&#45;desired inflation for the 1% as liquidity flows through their system and deflation for the rest of us, whose system is increasingly laboring.</body>

<title>Deflation Pulls Ahead - PracticalDad Price Index, July 2013</title>
<body>When it comes to the topic of inflation, central bankers are to pubescent males as the rest of us are to prim young girls who&#39;ve been well&#45;schooled by protective mothers:  C&#39;mon, it&#39;ll be great.  Everything&#39;ll be fine since I&#39;ve got experience with this.  You want it and you know that you want it.  What does your mother know?  She&#39;s so old&#45;fashioned... But despite the conniving and constant wheedling efforts, July&#39;s PracticalDad Price Index indicates that dear ol&#39; Mom has pegged the bankers with a cast&#45;iron skillet.  Both the Total Index and Food&#45;only Indices (November 2010 = 100) have dropped from June&#39;s figures.  The Total Index &#45; covering 47 separate items priced in three unrelated supermarkets &#45; declined  from June&#39;s 107.65 to 107.57; however, the 37 item food&#45;only index dropped steeply from June&#39;s 113.55 to July&#39;s 113.13 &#45; almost a half of one percent in one month.
The results of the past four months are:
Month/Year &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Total Index &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Food&#45;Only Index &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Spread
4/13 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;107.29 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 113.46 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 6.17
5/13 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;107.64 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 113.68 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 6.04
6/13 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;107.65 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 113.55 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 5.90
7/13 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;107.57 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 113.13 &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 5.56
The upshot is that for these items in the market basket, prices have risen 7.57% for all of the items and 13.13% for the foodstuffs alone. &amp;nbsp;Despite their best efforts, the central bankers are falling behind in their efforts.</body>

<title>The 4th of July and the Kids</title>
<body>On holidays &#45; except for Christmas &#45; I&#39;m up earlier than everyone else and today&#39;s 4th of July was no different.&amp;nbsp; But when all of the kids were up and gathered in the kitchen, I wished them a happy 4th of July and was taken aback when Middle responded that with all of the news coming out about both the extent of NSA surveillance and the Nixonian weaponization of the IRS, it was hard to find anything remotely happy about this particular 4th of July.&amp;nbsp; I stood there for a minute and said nothing and then finally had to agree with him, a high school junior.&amp;nbsp;  After all, what future does he, his siblings and his peers have if we don&#39;t bring this abuse to heel?
I&#39;m enough of a history buff to understand that there are periodic abuses to power of one form or another and our history is littered with them.&amp;nbsp; But I don&#39;t recall any point in our history when the government was so technologically and physically capable of muzzling free speech, let alone dissent and how we manage to remedy it leaves me at a loss.&amp;nbsp; Our young adults are stressed and who can blame them?&amp;nbsp; The bulk of the stress is laid at the feet of money and economics as they bought into the polemic that the road to the middle class was through higher education, only to finish with debt and a declining middle class that can&#39;t offer them work to support both themselves and their debt.&amp;nbsp; If I laid out a bundle for World Series tickets and found that I&#39;d wound up with a Class A preseason game ticket, I&#39;d be stressed too.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s detestable about my generation &#45; the Boomers &#45; is that we&#39;ve forgotten the generational compact that has threaded throughout our history; our forebears had a rudimentary knowledge of history and understood that there were moments when this Constitution they&#39;d been given required protection and support so that it could be passed to the next generation.&amp;nbsp; This was the way of the Revolutionary and Civil War generations, and the &amp;quot;Greatest&amp;quot; generation of the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; It was even understood by the so&#45;called &amp;quot;Silent&amp;quot; generation who stood up to Nixon&#39;s predations and forced his resignation in a near&#45;constitutional crisis.&amp;nbsp; But it was a Boomer who, when the Soviet Union fell, penned a book entitled The End of History, as though everything through history had come to fruition for that particular generation.&amp;nbsp; Unlike the preceding generations, the Boomers deemed themselves the recipients of this form of government instead of its custodians and guardians.&amp;nbsp; So we&#39;re left in this creepy place in which most of our citizens have given up paying attention and our government responds to any perceived threat by dressing it up as a terrorist.
And there is sat for the next hour, until I came across a youtube video &#45; hosted by Morgan Freeman &#45; that culminates in a shared reading of the Declaration of Independence. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s an impressive piece and one that I&#39;m showing to the kids, especially Middle. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m like many Americans who still believe in the premise of the nation; the trick will be to assure that this belief passes on to the Millenials and that will only happen if we first teach them and then act as guardians instead of recipients.
Happy Fourth of July, 2013.

<title>The Great Reversion</title>
<body>Follow the economic and financial news and you&#39;ll hear a significant number of economic terms to describe this economic environment after the Financial Crisis of 2007:  Great Recession; Depression; Jobless Recovery; Deflation; Inflation; Stagflation.&amp;nbsp; A post at Jesse&#39;s Crossroads Cafe notes a recent column by Paul Krugman and while I understand that Krugman is at heart an academic, I marvel at how the terminology and wording obscures the truth of where we as Americans are at.&amp;nbsp; The economists can argue all that they want about what they perceive from the evidence, like three blind men feeling an elephant and pronouncing it as one thing or another.&amp;nbsp; But the terminology can&#39;t obscure the fact that the elephant in the American Room today is a great reversion from the past sixty years of American economic dominance to a society of greater, choking debt, constrained resources and fewer opportunities for our young people.
Continuing to cloud the circumstances with the same economic terms implies that what we&#39;re undergoing is cyclical and that with just the right magic combination of interest rate cuts/rises, monetary supply targets and maybe, just maybe budgetary choices, we can once again regain our footing and right our ship.&amp;nbsp; The simple reality that we have to grasp is that this is a true reversion to a previous level of standard of living and one that&#39;s most reminiscent of our great&#45;grandparents.&amp;nbsp; There is no return to what we remember as the glory days, whether we deem them as the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or even 1990s.
Part of what I do &#45; simply part of what makes me tick &#45; is to pay attention to what&#39;s going on the world around me and the real&#45;life economic data just reflects that old line and the hits just keep on coming.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;ve got any notion of what&#39;s happening in the real world, you know that more Americans are going on food stamps than ever before and that jobs with livable wages and benefits are fewer and farther between.&amp;nbsp; But there were two recent reports that caught my attention.&amp;nbsp; The first was that the median American family wealth declined by more than a third between 2003 and 2013.&amp;nbsp; The idea that the median family lost more than a full third in one decade is stunning and given that more and more jobs created are part&#45;time and/or without the benefits with which we&#39;re familiar, it&#39;s well&#45;nigh impossible to see how this is going to be reversed and that level of wealth reclaimed.&amp;nbsp; The second report was that the amount of student debt carried by young adult graduates was impacting their long&#45;term financial health, as high school graduates with no debt had a higher net worth than college graduates with debt.&amp;nbsp; The system is now terminally booby&#45;trapped as American society propounds the necessity of a college degree, yet the attainment of that degree leaves the graduate so indebted that their long&#45;term financial health is crippled.&amp;nbsp; In a new environment in which the individual and family are going to have to pay greater attention than before to their own well&#45;being, this is a set&#45;up for failure.
There is so much that parents are supposed to do for their children &#45; feed, house, love, discipline, raise &#45; but the core goal of parenthood is not to raise a happy child, it is to raise a child who will be able to make his or her way in the world as a moral and productive adult.&amp;nbsp; But parents have to understand that what&#39;s happening is not your previously&#45;typical ebb and flow recession; these are serious structural changes to the economy that will necessarily flow into so many other facets of our lives &#45; food and cooking, housing, education, medicine, child&#45;rearing.&amp;nbsp; If we do not move beyond the economics jargon and wrap our heads around what&#39;s actually occurring, then we won&#39;t be able to adjust accordingly and more importantly, we will be raising our children to live in an outmoded world for which they&#39;ll be ill&#45;prepared to function as the goal &#45; moral and productive adults.
The model with which we were raised ourselves is gone.&amp;nbsp; Dead.&amp;nbsp; Finished.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s time to recognize the reversion and move on accordingly.</body>

<title>When Does the Academic Push Become Too Much?</title>
<body>We&#39;re old enough to remember the academically over&#45;achieving character from John Hughes&#39; The Breakfast Club, played by Anthony Michael Hall.&amp;nbsp; As the various stereotypes spend the Saturday detention together, he responds to the razzing by breaking down about the pressure that he&#39;s under to perform academically and gain the grades.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve seen similar &#45; but less dramatic &#45; scenarios first hand as the local state university permits qualifying high school students to take college level courses; these grades are included in the calculation of the student Grade Point Averages as the courses carry a higher weight than the standard high school class.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that there are kids who take the courses knowing that not only can they earn transferrable college credits, but are able to pad the GPA so that they can graduate with a number higher than the previously perfect 4.0 of earlier generations.&amp;nbsp; Eldest was a student in this category as she took college courses during her junior year of high school.&amp;nbsp; But is there a point at which the academic push becomes too much and is actually detrimental to the child?
This was the situation faced by several children in Youngest&#39;s elementary school.&amp;nbsp; Each of the kids had been identified in second grade as having advanced math skills and were accordingly allowed to take math with the class at the next grade level, so that when in third grade, they took fourth grade math and so on.&amp;nbsp; But the group is now entering sixth grade &#45; the last year of elementary school in our district &#45; and have already completed the elementary school math curriculum; what&#39;s to be done for these kids?&amp;nbsp; The true sixth graders who are moving on to middle school are required to take a placement test during the spring of their year to ascertain at what level of math they&#39;re to be placed in seventh grade:  some will move on to Algebra I while others take the basic Math 7; the majority will wind up in Pre&#45;Algebra.&amp;nbsp; The school district understood that these kids were in a different category and the decision was made that they should also take the placement test for middle school with the understanding that simply repeating that sixth grade math curriculum wasn&#39;t an option in anybody&#39;s best interest.&amp;nbsp; If the child scored high enough, then the placement would be made as though they were rising seventh&#45;graders with the option to attend the middle&#45;school for the first period with a bus returning them to elementary school for the remainder of the day.
This arrangement is workable in theory and the parents are appreciative of the district&#39;s efforts to accommodate the kids.&amp;nbsp; But good intentions run headlong into physical reality in the details of the plan.&amp;nbsp; The elementary school begins the day at 9 AM and ends at 3:30 PM while the middle school begins at 7:30 and ends at 2:30; asking the sixth graders to attend the first period of middle school means that their school day is effectively 90 minutes longer than anybody else&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; It might sound like sour grapes but it&#39;s not a fairness issue at all since these kids are all at the edge of puberty, a time when the body&#39;s chemistry generally begins to also alter their sleep schedules so that the body&#39;s natural inclination is to go to sleep later and awaken later.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t mean that things won&#39;t work out alright, but the stage is set for a year of crankiness and angst as the kids are propelled into an entirely different &#45; and sometimes unpleasant &#45; world a year earlier than their classmates and doing so on less sleep than they&#39;re probably going to need.&amp;nbsp;  On an aggregate basis, the extra 90 minutes means that they&#39;ll be attending an additional full day of school each week or about 36 days per year.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s an additional seven weeks of school.
Because I was familiar with the situation, I spoke independently with my older two kids &#45; Eldest and Middle &#45; who&#39;ve already been through that level and their comments were identical: it&#39;s just not worth it since taking Algebra I a year early isn&#39;t worth the lost sleep.&amp;nbsp; That was something that I hadn&#39;t considered either; Algebra I was &#45; when I was in school &#45; not something that was even considered until at least the eighth grade.&amp;nbsp; In our desire to push the kids, at least those who are willing to be pushed, we&#39;ve made more available at an earlier age with the expectations that following this track will challenge the kids and help them play the GPA game, setting themselves up for college and potential scholarships.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an understandable goal but we have to continuously try to balance that against the physical realities of childhood growth and development.
I don&#39;t know how it went for all of the kids, but I do know that the school district has made arrangements for a gifted education instructor to provide a specific Pre&#45;Algebra course at the elementary school for the students in question.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an interim measure but one that&#39;s greatly appreciated, reflective of the lengths to which this particular district will go to accommodate the kids.&amp;nbsp; It also means that even if the student did qualify for the middle&#45;school Algebra I course, the parents have an additional option that makes their child&#39;s life far more bearable for the coming year.&amp;nbsp; We want our kids to succeed and it&#39;s our responsibility to prepare them for the great, wide world; but it&#39;s also our responsibility to understand that they&#39;re also still children with the physical parameters of a growing, changing body.</body>

<title>When Dad Screws Up</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s easy when the kids are little and look upon Dad as being someone omnipotent and omniscient, but there does come a day when the bloom comes off of the rose and they recognize that Dad is as fallible as anyone else. &amp;nbsp;And then there are the instances when the screw&#45;up is sufficiently embarrassing that Dad has to wonder how it&#39;s going to really appear. &amp;nbsp;Such was the occasion a week ago when the website&#39;s domain name registration expired because this Dad wrote the wrong date on the calendar.
This website has existed for five years and now holds approximately 600 essays and articles, all original, and the kids know that I try to find time to get away and write; it&#39;s now my outlet.&amp;nbsp; So I was severely non&#45;plussed to go to the site over a week ago and find that it had been deactivated, the homepage pasted over with some stock page that listed other terms involving the word practical.&amp;nbsp; After the initial shock and a momentary fear that five years of writing had gone down the proverbial tubes, I slowed myself down and walked through what had happened.&amp;nbsp; The articles and site were still there, but it was as though a shutter had been thrown across the storefront.&amp;nbsp; The next thought was a simple question:&amp;nbsp; how do I explain this screwup to the kids?&amp;nbsp; My wife is an adult with enough experience to recognize that occasional gaffes occur and that when they do, we fix them and move on.&amp;nbsp; The kids are also old enough to recognize this, but it was pointedly embarrassing on this front since I actively promote awareness of what&#39;s going on around them.&amp;nbsp; What is your schedule and when is something happening or due?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s your deadline?&amp;nbsp; What are the consequences when something doesn&#39;t happen that should?&amp;nbsp; This screwup played right to the heart of what I actively try to teach.
So what to do?&amp;nbsp;
Instead of hiding it, I frankly admitted that I&#39;d screwed up royally.&amp;nbsp; It was painfully embarrassing to admit to the kids that I&#39;d blown it, making an error as simple as getting the date wrong.&amp;nbsp; But if my principal job is to prepare the kids for living in the great wide world, then it&#39;s my responsibility to share both positive and negative lessons.&amp;nbsp; What are the consequences of this goof?&amp;nbsp; Are they permanent or is it fixable?&amp;nbsp; What are the lessons for this particular and what can I illustrate with them?&amp;nbsp; Each will take something different away than another.&amp;nbsp; For Youngest, it was a lesson in global business as the server is housed with an Australian firm that years ago purchased the American company that had granted the original domain name; not only that, but my subsequent actions were taken with their operations center, which the Australians had outsourced to the Philippines.&amp;nbsp; Yeah son, it&#39;s kind of like that show that NBC cancelled about a call center in India, &amp;quot;Outsourced&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; For the older two, it&#39;s been more of a question of managing to not panic and working the problem, walking through the issues.&amp;nbsp; How far ahead is Manila from here in terms of time?&amp;nbsp; Do I need to contact my credit card company in advance to verify that the charge coming through is legitimate and not fraud?&amp;nbsp; By the way, the answers to the two respective questions are 13 hours and yes.&amp;nbsp;

The conversations haven&#39;t been extensive and filled with angst; they&#39;re already well aware that Dad goofs.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s no sense in hiding the error, either.&amp;nbsp; Because any corrective actions should it have been a fatal error &#45; website relaunch, et cetera &#45; would have required coming up with cover stories that would&#39;ve been impossible to keep straight.&amp;nbsp;
And that&#39;s the big lesson for the kids.&amp;nbsp; Acknowledge the error, take the hit to the ego and move on.

<title>Father(s) of the Year, 2013</title>
<body>With the recent announcement that Bill Clinton has been named as one of the recipients for the 2013 Father of the Year Award from the National Father&#39;s Day Committee&amp;nbsp; I thought that it would be worthwhile to announce my own three winners.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not necessarily that I dislike Bill Clinton &#45; great politician, but like other great politicians, not someone you&#39;d want to date your daughter &#45; but the whole thing smells of an attempt to raise money for two charities and the bigger the names, the more the money.&amp;nbsp; The intent of the affair is to raise money for the American Diabetes Association as well as Save the Children and the efforts will raise millions of dollars for the charities, albeit by bestowing honors upon those who can deliver ticket sales and publicity; it&#39;s just the way that the world works.
It&#39;s honestly annoying and I know that everybody knows someone personally who&#39;d be a great nominee.&amp;nbsp; So I&#39;d like to nominate three men who I believe exemplify fatherhood in today&#39;s fast&#45;paced, economically stressed society.
Jeff is a former bank operations manager, stepfather of one son and father of two more.&amp;nbsp; When he lost his job &#45; his bank was forced into a sale after major internal fraud &#45; he returned to school to earn his teaching degree and proceeded to do so with all three boys still under the roof.&amp;nbsp; During that period, he worked multiple part&#45;time and tutoring jobs to help keep food on the table and a roof over the heads and since earning that education degree, has joined the millions of college graduates in an ongoing search for permanent employment while working in temporary and substitute positions.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve known him through this entire period and he&#39;s been active in multiple volunteer roles, performed because he understands that the kids&#39; activities aren&#39;t run with paid staff or by themselves and it&#39;s not uncommon to see him at a son&#39;s baseball game, grading student papers while he watches and cheers.
Rob is a small&#45;town police detective with two children, a boy and a girl.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s been active in multiple activities apart from work and family, principally baseball, scouting and teaching Christian education at the elementary school level.&amp;nbsp; Rob&#39;s like most fathers who are involved with the kids, running full tilt from work to activity and home, just to start up again early the next day, repeating the process.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s notable about the guy is that he&#39;s fully aware that he serves as a role model, particularly for the boys, and is unceasing in his upbeat manner even when the kids&#39; antics might privately drive him to distraction or me to manslaughter.
Lou is a mechanic and divorced father of two boys, a guy who once told a major&#45;league owner that his stable of pitches included a curve, a decent fastball and a beanball (if so requested).&amp;nbsp; He has custody of the boys and has to navigate the intricacies of parenting amidst divorce when ex&#45;spouses might not see eye&#45;to&#45;eye.&amp;nbsp; Like the others, he stretches his time between work and activities, in this case acting as coach for both sons&#39; teams which might entail having to be in two places simultaneously or at the same location for the better part of an entire day as the boys share ball fields, if not teams.&amp;nbsp; Like his co&#45;nominees, he recognizes that the events won&#39;t occur by themselves and further acts as an umpire for other games so that the activities can move forward.
None of the three have President Clinton&#39;s list of accomplishments, staff or peccadiloes and apart from the few who know them, none could be picked out by the masses of Americans were their photos tagged on bulletin boards.&amp;nbsp; What each does have in common &#45; if not with the president &#45; is an understanding that fatherhood is akin to a full contact sport that encompasses more than just putting a roof over the head and food on the table.&amp;nbsp; It requires persistence and energy, a willingness to engage the kids in more aspects of their lives than would have been thought of by fathers even two generations ago.&amp;nbsp; It is presence, conversation, education, encouragement, discipline, expectation, and yes, love.&amp;nbsp; They have family, but no paid staff, to help them and they understand that barring some weird quirk of fate, they will never gain such power or fame that their own kids will be able to rely on anything other than their own efforts to survive when they themselves become adults. &amp;nbsp;
So guys, Happy Father&#39;s Day to you.&amp;nbsp; And to the millions of other men who quietly undertake a role that&#39;s so much in transition from what their own fathers and grandfathers experienced, Happy Father&#39;s Day to you as well.&amp;nbsp; There will be no audience recognition and any money for the charities will likely come from your own wallet.&amp;nbsp; But then again, raising children isn&#39;t about ticket sales but instead, preparing them for the great wide world.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>The Warning on Privacy and Required Reading</title>
<body>My goal has been to maintain a sense of balance over the ongoing economic and political turmoil but the cumulative news about the IRS, the AP phone pulls and now the revelation of the extent of governmental eavesdropping strike with the force of body blows.&amp;nbsp; My principal job as a parent &#45; a father &#45; is to not only care for and raise the kids, but prepare them to make their way in the great wide world.&amp;nbsp; How am I supposed to raise my children to be productive, moral adults in a society which increasingly makes such traits difficult to uphold?
Thanks to the spot&#45;on and hilarious rants of Jon Stewart, even Youngest is aware of the furious controversy over the use of the IRS as a political weapon.&amp;nbsp; Once the laughter was through, it served as a jumping off spot for a series of short conversations about the function of the IRS and how it&#39;s been mishandled; the conversations have occurred as well with the older two kids.&amp;nbsp; But with the disclosure of the extent of domestic surveillance by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, there was a very brief and pointed conversation with Eldest as she reclined on the sofa after the end of her work shift.&amp;nbsp; The preface to the conversation was the question of whether or not she had heard about the NSA domestic surveillance program and when she indicated that she&#39;d heard of it, I advised her to begin following the story at length and directed her to the English newspaper, The Guardian.&amp;nbsp; The reasonable question was why? and my response was that this particular issue was one that put her own plugged&#45;in generation at greater risk than their elder generations.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s why the warning and start of further conversations about the NSA mess; our kids&#39; generation &#45; the so&#45;called Millenials &#45; is the most technologically savvy generation in the history of this planet and use the surveilled media for almost all of their various thoughts and plans.&amp;nbsp; Yet for the technologic erudition, they lack the common sense that dictates what should and shouldn&#39;t be written, what should and shouldn&#39;t be shared, and what should and shouldn&#39;t be discussed via the various media; it&#39;s not unknown for me to cease an electronic conversation simply because there are some things that are best done face&#45;to&#45;face.&amp;nbsp; That said, a previous career in Risk Management taught me that some things should never be put on paper or digitized simply because it&#39;s potentially discoverable in the event of litigation.&amp;nbsp; Whether it&#39;s discoverable by opposing counsel or some dink in an NSA cubicle is irrelevant, once it&#39;s out there, it&#39;s out there.
The word came down to Middle as well and he went to the</body>

<title>Backyard GMO Gardening</title>
<body>I live for the instances when you can make a link between a social/economic issue and what&#39;s available right there in the household.&amp;nbsp; There are so many significant issues in the world that will impact our kids and when the bulk of their time is spent wrapped inside of an electronic cocoon, it&#39;s easy for them to not see that there&#39;s a true link between the local and the global.&amp;nbsp; Such is the case with the backyard garden and the issue of Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) plants, which is presently an international controversy, principally for fear of the economic power that&#39;s being given to multinational corporations such as Monsanto.&amp;nbsp; But how can I make an explicable link for the kids with a seemingly remote global issue?
First of all, what is a Genetically Modified Organism?&amp;nbsp; It is as the name implies, a seed that&#39;s been genetically altered so that inherent traits are suppressed or enhanced; such modifications can make it impervious to certain types of insects or blights, increase yield per acre, or take on characteristics and traits of other plants.&amp;nbsp; As typically occurs in American culture, someone figures out a way to maximize profit and that way is to also create seeds that are modified to be sterile so that the seeds of the resulting plant are incapable of reproducing and an increasing percentage of the seeds sold are accordingly sterile.&amp;nbsp; If you want more seeds, then you have to go back to the supplier and purchase more of the same sterile seeds with a resulting lucrative revenue stream.
The link occurred to me as I was working in the backyard and glanced over at the two tiered garden plots built into the slope of the backyard landscaping.&amp;nbsp; With mulching and other work still unfinished, I hadn&#39;t yet begun to turn over the dirt for the summer&#39;s batch of tomato and pepper plants and I realized that amidst the weeds were tomato seedlings sprouting up, leftovers from the remnants of a few of last season&#39;s tomatoes that had rotted on the ground and gone to earth.&amp;nbsp; I wondered what kind of yield these plants would put out and it then occurred to me that I&#39;d purchased the plants at a local box store; given the source, it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the seeds had been genetically modified so that the customers would be forced to return to the same store for next year&#39;s plants.&amp;nbsp; It resulted in a plan to let two of the most developed seedlings survive in the plot to see what resulted and the rest of the dirt was turned and prepped for the new crop.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, I don&#39;t know if a seed that&#39;s been genetically modified for sterility will result in a plant that doesn&#39;t produce yield or if it will permit a plant to even begin to grow but the quiet experiment will determine one way or another.&amp;nbsp; When Youngest was outside later on, I pulled him aside and showed him the plants, explaining the concept of GMO &#45; which an intelligent elementary schooler can grasp &#45; and the summer experiment to see what resulted; I will do the same later this week to Middle and Eldest, who is now a college student with a biology minor.
The plan is to let these plants grow along with the others that are being planted and see what develops, following up with the kids later.&amp;nbsp; What matters though, is that there is some effort to not only expose them to an issue that appears in the news, but also that it can be found right there.&amp;nbsp; If the battle cry is to think globally and act locally, then they have to have a clue that these issues aren&#39;t just intellectual exercises as sterile as the seeds.&amp;nbsp; They need to be able to see the link between the global issue and the plant growing in their backyard garden.</body>

<title>&#8216;Flation Rages On:&nbsp; The PracticalDad Price Index - June 2013</title>
<body>The results of the June 2013 PracticalDad Price Index are in and the &#39;flationary battle continues to rage on.&amp;nbsp; The fact that the results show no change in the total index &#45; May&#39;s Total Index of 107.64 versus June&#39;s 107.65 &#45; and an actual drop in the Food&#45;only Index from May&#39;s 113.68 to June&#39;s 113.55 &#45; indicates that the inflationary aspirations of the global central banks are running headlong into the reality of underemployment, excessive bad debt and declining real wages.&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s impossible to say whether it&#39;s inflation or deflation and we&#39;re left with &#39;flation.&amp;nbsp;
Recall that the index is composed of 47 separate items that can be purchased at any of three separate and unrelated grocery stores, and that 37 of these items comprise the Food&#45;Only segment of the Total Index.&amp;nbsp; With the scale set at November 2010 = 100, the upshot is that the cost of the average Food&#45;only items in the marketbasket actually declined from May 2013 to June 2013.&amp;nbsp;
The results of the past four months are:

<title>Kids&#8217; Sporting Equipment:&nbsp; Expenditure or Investment?</title>
<body>Parents want the kids to do well and will go to great extent to support them in their endeavors, and we&#39;re no exception.&amp;nbsp; Follow their progress closely?&amp;nbsp; Check.&amp;nbsp; Provide emotional support and constructive criticism?&amp;nbsp; Check.&amp;nbsp; Go to as many of their events/games/practices as possible?&amp;nbsp; Check.&amp;nbsp; Participate in fundraisers?&amp;nbsp; Check.&amp;nbsp; Purchase all of the best equipment and gear?&amp;nbsp; Che...let&#39;s wait a minute here.&amp;nbsp; Where is the line to be drawn on supporting the kids in a society in which the average family income is dropping steadily and food&#45;stamp usage is rising?&amp;nbsp; Is there a dollar threshold on the status of good, supportive and loving parent?&amp;nbsp; Am I obligated to purchase the most expensive equipment?
This is a scenario with which I&#39;ve wrestled for years as the three kids &#45; Eldest, Middle and Youngest &#45; have grown and found their way through the myriad of activities that come with multiple children.&amp;nbsp; Although they&#39;ve been cumulatively involved with volleyball, soccer and basketball through the years, none of these have the equipment requirements of the single remaining sport of the PracticalDad clan &#45; baseball.&amp;nbsp; The others have fallen by the wayside as the elder kids aged or found other significant outlets such as music...although that&#39;s not cheap either.&amp;nbsp; The issue came clearly into focus last week when we realized that Youngest desperately needed a baseball bat.&amp;nbsp; Our habit with the kids as they grew was to outfit their needs at a secondhand sporting goods store whenever possible since they&#39;d outgrow everything in a relatively short time.&amp;nbsp; This included Youngest&#39;s first baseball bat, a 30&amp;quot; aluminum bat by DeMarini.&amp;nbsp; But after a recent game, a coach from the opposing team &#45; in this league, he&#39;s been coached by everybody through the years &#45; stopped him to offer some comments on his stance and recommended a particular batting drill to help him learn to not open up when he swung the bat.&amp;nbsp; We dutifully went to the local school diamond and over the course of almost two hours, performed the drill again for almost two hundred at&#45;bats; in the course of this, I watched him work at the plate and realized that given his size, the 30&amp;quot; bat didn&#39;t allow him to fully cover the plate.&amp;nbsp; When we discussed it, he commented now I understand why I keep pulling strikes on the outside of the plate.&amp;nbsp;
So the boy needed a new bat and I kicked myself for not realizing that he&#39;d need a new bat since the 30&amp;quot; bat was purchased when he was at least a half foot shorter.&amp;nbsp; Kids not only grow at different rates, but the same kid can grow unevenly so that feet and hands are disproportionate to the rest of the body.&amp;nbsp; I believe in serendipity; over the previous several weeks, I&#39;d been privy to multiple conversations with fathers and coaches and the discussion turned to batting and by extension, bats.&amp;nbsp; The lessons from these conversations were:

    A bat actually has a lifespan, regardless of whether it&#39;s aluminum or wood, and it&#39;s discernible via the sound of the ball being hit;
    Bat size matters since the length and weight affect the swing of the batter, particularly regarding where he stands in the box and the speed with which he swings the bat &#45; and it&#39;s the speed at which the bat is swung that matters in the force with which a ball is hit;
    A batter can do well with a particular bat but poorly with another since the more one bats, the more the bat becomes an extension of the batter, as though it were part of his own body;
    What&#39;s allowable for bat specifications changes from one level of play to another and how long you expect the kid to play at a particular level will help ascertain whether the bat should be bought new or used;
    Just because a bat states that it&#39;s Little&#45;League Approved doesn&#39;t mean that it is since the Little League&#39;s list of allowable bats changes and what&#39;s allowable one year can change to another.

The result was several hours of online reading on bat standards and guidelines on the suggested size for a boy&#39;s height and weight with the realization that not only was his present bat too short by two inches, but he was growing at a rate that would move him even further, to a 33&amp;quot; bat.&amp;nbsp; We decided to go with a new bat and went to the only local sporting goods store that carried a reasonable variety of bats but this far into the season, the selection was picked through and there was only one 32&amp;quot; bat &#45; and no 33&amp;quot; bats &#45; available.&amp;nbsp; Youngest went to a deserted part of the store for multiple practice swings and when he brought the bat back, I looked at the pricetag and gasped oh crap! at the sticker.&amp;nbsp; What made the purchase digestible was the knowledge that the boy has at least another season at this level before moving onto the adult bats used at the next level so that the cost was spread over a longer period of time.
So what did I learn from the experience?

    Pay close attention to the child&#39;s size and ask whether or not he or she needs to upsize the present equipment, not including the ubiquitous cleats.
    If there is a size upgrade, are there additional levels to the equipment by age and/or size and if so, how long can I expect the kid to be in that level?
    Is it a piece of equipment that makes a discernible difference in the child&#39;s performance for the sport, or is one just like another so that they&#39;re essentially all the same?

Youngest has already used the new bat although it&#39;s too early to tell whether it&#39;s going to make a difference.&amp;nbsp; He is the youngest player on his team although there&#39;s only one teammate taller than him and his new bat is significantly larger than the rest of the team&#39;s bats.&amp;nbsp; What was fascinating at the game was to watch his teammates use the bat instead of their smaller bats, swinging it in batting practice and taking it to the plate.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps that&#39;s where I can make the cost of the bat more digestible, understanding that the investment in it will now be spread over a far greater number of plate appearances since this was clearly an investment instead of an expenditure.

<title>Guns and Kids:&nbsp; AirSoft</title>
<body>If I&#39;m going to raise the kids to know how to use firearms &#45; safely and properly &#45; is there a place for the use of Airsoft toy guns?
For those who aren&#39;t aware, Airsoft is the 21st century equivalent of the old Red Ryder BB gun, a high tech air&#45;powered weapon that shoots plastic pellets and is popular in the newly&#45;rushing testosterone set.&amp;nbsp; They come in multiple variants that resemble real weapons, albeit with bright red endpieces so that the average joe isn&#39;t stunned by their presence, and shoot round plastic pellets that leave a nasty mark.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve heard parents tell the kids that they shouldn&#39;t be shooting at one another when they&#39;re outside with them but that&#39;s as effective as telling the family dog to shut up when another dog trots by.&amp;nbsp; The result is that the kids engage in mock warfare and it&#39;s not uncommon for at least one of them to return with multiple welts from pellet impacts.&amp;nbsp; This honestly any different from when my generation played with BB guns and I can recall multiple instances of my friends and I blithely disregarding the parental warnings and playing war games.&amp;nbsp; But have times changed sufficiently so that it really is an issue?
My own sense &#45; and the house rule &#45; is that an Airsoft device won&#39;t be purchased for the kids to use for two reasons.&amp;nbsp; The first is the simple issue of safety; when the kids know that they can play &quot;safe&quot; war games and still have the adrenaline rush of stinging the other guy, then they&#39;ll likely use the Airsoft gun for human/animal target practice.&amp;nbsp; The second reason is that it blurs and lessens the sense of responsibility that should extend to guns and other weapons.&amp;nbsp; If a kid has access to, and use of, an Airsoft gun, then he&#39;ll likely begin to think that he&#39;s an expert in the use of real guns should he have access to them.&amp;nbsp; When my wife and I had the opportunity to speak with a pistol instructor &#45; a former Marine sergeant and Blackwater contractor &#45; this was his sense as well.&amp;nbsp; In his world, a gun is something that deserves the utmost respect for it&#39;s capacity to kill, even if it&#39;s owned for reasons of personal defense or even hobby.&amp;nbsp; There are safety rules that must be strictly followed because any lapse in their usage can result in a potentially fatal accident and in his view, kids who are used to the forgiving nature of Airsoft are likely to treat the real gun with a lessened respect  that increases the possibility of incident.&amp;nbsp; Gun ownership requires a higher order of responsibility and discipline for the recognition of the destructive capacity of the gun, as well as an inherent understanding that no one is invulnerable and all are subject to injury and in the worst case, death.&amp;nbsp; But the simple reality is that most children and teens have no experience with death and believe themselves to be invulnerable and the notion that their actions could go awry hasn&#39;t occurred to them.
The upshot &#45; if you&#39;ll pardon the pun &#45; is that we&#39;ve opted to forego Airsoft guns.&amp;nbsp; We will make sure that the kids learn how to handle guns properly and with strict supervision, but anything that blurs the line of adherence to the safe handling of firearms will be disallowed in the household.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s an Airsoft gun to be used, it will have to be used elsewhere.</body>

With major central banks &#45; the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank &#45; going all out to push for inflation, there&#39;s little to show since the indices dropped from their December 2012 highs; indeed, they are slowly crawling up from February 2013 and the wait for inflation increasingly resembles a scene out of Samuel Beckett&#39;s Waiting for Godot.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Corroborating Food Stamp Usage:&nbsp; The Chicken Factor</title>
<body>While questions continue about whether monetary policies will spur inflation that affects families, other news pertains to the new levels of food stamp usage as more Americans are forced to turn to government assistance for food purchases.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s also been an uptick in stories about food stamp fraud.&amp;nbsp; Whether the cause is due to a disbelief that such numbers could truly be that bad or &#45; in one of my more cynical moments &#45; the notion that the the stage is being set for placing limits on further food stamp aid by framing the program as fraud&#45;riddled, the fraud stories are occurring.&amp;nbsp; Since it&#39;s sometimes difficult to know who to believe, it&#39;s helpful to find a separate data point to corroborate the facts, one way or another.&amp;nbsp; In my own case, I&#39;ve come to notice that there are suburban, seemingly middle&#45;class families who are now raising chickens in the backyard for food; I&#39;ve come to refer to this as The Chicken Factor.&amp;nbsp;
Through years of media exposure, the image of a family with chickens is one of a ramshackle rural home in the midst of nowhere, one or more paint&#45;peeling shutters slightly askew.&amp;nbsp; The family can charitably be called redneck or hillbilly, dressed in unkempt clothing.&amp;nbsp; But what I&#39;m starting to see, and it&#39;s still only three instances, is a comfortable middle&#45;class style home with fenced pens to accommodate chickens.&amp;nbsp; Each home also has a significantly sized garden in which to grow food that&#39;s being used for the family&#39;s consumption.&amp;nbsp; I first became aware of it about two years ago when a family that I knew had Youngest over to play and when I entered the backyard, found a well&#45;tended garden and chickens running loose out of their pen.&amp;nbsp; This can considered an isolated instance but for the past three months.&amp;nbsp; The first additional evidence was during a trip to Lowes when I stopped by the how&#45;to book section and found a stylish, glossy book on how to raise chickens.&amp;nbsp; The second additional evidence is that I&#39;ve noticed two other houses with both vegetable gardens and small chicken coops and pens.&amp;nbsp; One is also in a circa&#45;1960s middle&#45;class neighborhood and the other is a neat, older home in a more rural setting; regardless however, the incongruity of it is jarring.&amp;nbsp;
One of the suburban homes sits on a street corner so that, sans&#45;fencing, the work being done is open for all to see and it&#39;s frankly impressive for the work that&#39;s being put into it.&amp;nbsp; The house had become slightly unkempt as it sat for sale for months on end, the yard cluttered with branch debris from the older trees that clustered the driveway and lot boundaries.&amp;nbsp; Then the sign disappeared and a remodeling contractor&#39;s pickup truck appeared in the driveway and as it remained there through the various days that I drove past, it became apparent that it belonged to the new owner and not just a contractor.&amp;nbsp; What the family has done to the house is akin to a suburban, 21st century version of Little House in the Suburb as the debris has been cleared and the majority of the trees felled and stumps removed, the trees cut up into firewood and neatly stacked into cords for next winter&#39;s consumption.&amp;nbsp; An inexpensive playset &#45; not one of the costly monstrosities &#45; belies the fact there are small children and while the yard has been restored, there is now a large garden plot and...a fenced&#45;in henhouse. So while I can&#39;t speak for the third house, I can attest that the two suburban homes belong to young families with small children.&amp;nbsp;
With the onset of the recession after the Financial Crisis of 2008, community and church ministry gardens began to spring up to provide fresh vegetables for stretched food banks.&amp;nbsp; This could at first be seen as a stop&#45;gap measure until things improved; I recall that my hometown allocated community garden space for citizens during the problematic 1970s but with the recovery in the 1980s, this land was converted to park space and is now heavily landscaped and unusable in any practicable sense for food production.&amp;nbsp; But these church/community gardens are now continuing and the demand from the food banks continues unabated.&amp;nbsp; I know of two such garden programs &#45; in separate parts of the country &#45; that are cumulatively providing tons of fresh produce for the food banks each season and they are expanding.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot of these datapoints is this.&amp;nbsp; As family incomes drop, by approximately 7% since the start of the Obama administration, the food supply issues reveal that what our young families are facing isn&#39;t a bump&#45;in&#45;the&#45;road that can be waited out but instead a much poorer road.&amp;nbsp;  Homeownership rates might have dropped to 15 year lows but the young families are reverting back even further than that to practices not seen since the times of their great&#45;grandparents.&amp;nbsp; The gardens might be a decent hobby or something nostalgic reminiscent of the World War Two Victory gardens, but combining the ongoing community/church gardens with chickens strongly indicates that the families are resetting to a far different set of expectations than with which they were raised.&amp;nbsp;
What I find unsettling is that two of the three henhouse/garden scenarios occur on properties from which the backyard is openly visible from the road.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s going on amongst the many houses with fenced yards or properties obscured otherwise?&amp;nbsp; Should there be substantive discussion about controls on the food stamp program, my recommendation would be that the government google recent satellite photos to ascertain what&#39;s occurring in the yards that we can&#39;t see from the street.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Having the Conversations</title>
<body>Tonight was an evening in which I pulled over the car to have a conversation with Youngest, who&#39;s now old enough that testosterone is starting to course through the veins of both he and his buddies.&amp;nbsp; On one level, it was just another conversation to cull through the phrases and comments that he&#39;s hearing and yet on another, it&#39;s the conversation, the first of many that will occur over the next half&#45;dozen or so years.&amp;nbsp; Even having had similar conversations with his older siblings, it doesn&#39;t get easier and it still puts me so far outside of my comfort zone that returning to it sometimes requires a compass and map.&amp;nbsp; But having this kind of conversation is crucial because I&#39;m certain that the kids are having their own conversations with both their peers and&amp;nbsp; the entertainment/media complex.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve made sure that the basics of birds and bees are clear with the kids from a young age and all of them knew the source of babies before they were in kindergarten.&amp;nbsp; But we left the mechanics alone and only went into further detail when they started asking or bringing comments home from elementary school; it was then that both my wife and I made the promise that I repeated to Youngest last night.&amp;nbsp; If you hear anything that you don&#39;t understand, or have a question on the meaning of a phrase or comment that you hear, then bring it to me and I&#39;ll answer it.&amp;nbsp; It will be factual and it will be correct, and after the actual definition, I&#39;ll even toss in some of the slang so that you have a clue of what you&#39;re hearing when you hear it.&amp;nbsp; The flip side is that it&#39;s incumbent upon me to actually honor that promise; I might have to defer the question to another time &#45; Honey, let&#39;s answer that one when no one else is around &#45; but it&#39;s critical that it&#39;s not only answered, but that I bring up the topic to the child.&amp;nbsp; Especially in the case of the boys, I added several additional comments:

    When you hear your buddies talking, accept it as gospel that they&#39;ve got lousy information and might not even know what they&#39;re saying;
    When you hear your buddies talking, accept it as gospel that even if they have a clue as to the concept, they have no experience with any of it;
    When you hear your buddies bragging when they&#39;re older, expect that they&#39;re blowing smoke.

The conversations that our kids are having aren&#39;t just with their peers however.&amp;nbsp; The entertainment/media complex has been having a long&#45;standing monologue with them via the electronic media &#45; television, music and video games &#45; for decades now and the level of the conversation progressively coursens over time.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t believe it, consider the impact of MTV&#39;s Jersey Shore and the subsequent behaviors of teens at the mall and on the street.&amp;nbsp; Pubescent teens strut down the street with loud and obnoxious swagger, proclaiming the most shallow nonsense but utterly ignorant of the most basic workings of the world around them. When the average American youth is spending about six hours daily in front of a screen, it&#39;s especially important that you make the effort to have conversations of your own; it&#39;s okay to tell them to turn off either a particular program or the entire device and make an effort to have conversations of your own.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve also found helpful is to quietly pursue my own inquiries into what&#39;s out there, by checking out the lyrics of some of their favorite tunes and periodically checking out popular youth websites.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fantasy to believe that I can stop the older kids from following them, shy of fully eliminating the electronics, but I can certainly be forewarned about what they&#39;re encountering.&amp;nbsp;
The conversations aren&#39;t always going to be heavily laden and not all of them are going to go well, but it &#39;s crucial that the effort be maintained.&amp;nbsp; The kids might even roll their eyes, but the truth is that they want to have your attention and conversations; and it&#39;s in everybody&#39;s best interests that you do.</body>

<title>Boys Stink</title>
<body>Literally.
I sat last week in a doctor&#39;s office, someone with whom I&#39;ve had enough experience to know that he also has three kids in the same age/gender mix &#45; elder girl, two younger brothers &#45; as my own.&amp;nbsp; It was one of those Spring days for which you desperately await, a time when you can enjoy the outside again.&amp;nbsp; He stated that he&#39;d taken a very early morning walk and my response was that I&#39;d actually thrown open the windows in the boys&#39; bedrooms before departing for the appointment; it was a day for which I&#39;d waited, a chance to air out the stale odors that had taken residence over the enclosed winter months.&amp;nbsp; He nodded in agreement, commenting that the boys&#39; hangout in his basement smelled heavily of sweaty feet and stale sweat.&amp;nbsp; Geez, boys do stink, don&#39;t they?&amp;nbsp; I remarked.&amp;nbsp; He responded Yeah, they really do.&amp;nbsp; Boys stink.&amp;nbsp;
The old axiom is that Spring is a time when a young man&#39;s fancy turns to love.&amp;nbsp; When you have boys who are teens or tweens, the fancy turns instead to thoughts of opening the bedroom windows in order to blow out the accumulated stink of winter.&amp;nbsp; The pubescent years are difficult enough as the teens try on new attitudes, opinions and looks like a diva tries on shoes.&amp;nbsp; But boys provide a literal insult to injury with the accumulated odors that accrue in their rooms; they can bathe daily and use all manner of deodorant, but their personal den generally accrues enough poor hygiene habits that there is a perceptibly stale funk.&amp;nbsp; There are the standard components of dirty socks and underwear that somehow wind up behind furniture or buried within the closet and there&#39;s a never&#45;ending refrain of reminders to hang up the damp bath towels.&amp;nbsp; I once entered a child&#39;s room and was immediately struck by the notion that there&#39;s something wrong with this picture; after several minutes of searching around, I realized that a bedroom has three dimensions and looked up to find underwear dangling from the ceiling light.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, son?&amp;nbsp; The amazing part is that when I commented to him later, his account of how it got there jibed with what I&#39;d expected when I first saw it.&amp;nbsp;
Boys are generally unaware of the details that surround them and the obliviousness reaches an absolute&#45;zero boundary when they enter the teen years.&amp;nbsp; But even the oblivion can be pierced by environment and the results are, well...someday we&#39;ll find them amusing.&amp;nbsp; In one instance, a boy decided to address the odors by spraying two drawers &#45; full of clean clothing &#45; with the larger part of a bottle of Axe deodorant while we were at the store; when we walked in the front door, the reek of Axe so permeated the house that we had to wheel about and exit the same door.&amp;nbsp; In another instance, a boy complained of a swarm of small flies in his room and when I investigated, I found an uneaten school lunch bag crammed into a clothing drawer, the flies drawn to the decaying fruit.&amp;nbsp; There are certainly other stories from this household which I won&#39;t share and I know of many others from fellow parents who can only shake their heads in disbelief.&amp;nbsp; If you have boys who aren&#39;t yet teens, you&#39;ll certainly accumulate your own.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot is this.&amp;nbsp;

    While we want our children to take responsibility for themselves and their personal environment, the path isn&#39;t on an even grade and there are periods when they enter the teen years that you actually think that they&#39;re regressing.&amp;nbsp; This is part and parcel of those years when the kids&#39; brains literally rewire themselves &#45; thank you, MRI studies &#45; and their thoughts apparently wind up lost for all of the dead&#45;end synapses that no longer accommodate traffic.
    There will likely be some conflict between the privacy&#45;conscious teen and the parent who wants to come through and at least keep the room habitable, culling through debris, opening windows, clearing out drawers and changing sheets.&amp;nbsp; Decide what your limit is and stick to it.&amp;nbsp;
    As they age, don&#39;t assume that they automatically know what to do with antiperspirant, deodorant and body sprays &#45; most especially in what amounts.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s self&#45;evident to parents but conversations with boys can lead to expressions of enlightenment that rival their personal discovery of a fourth dimension or an answer as to why the Cubs just can&#39;t seem to make it to the playoffs.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

The long and short is that we have to be prepared to continue to monitor and work with them, even when we wish that we didn&#39;t have to.&amp;nbsp; We also have to make decisions as to what we&#39;ll tolerate and what kind of conflict we&#39;ll have to undergo as we help them grow through this period.&amp;nbsp; Our failure &#45; and I know of parents who won&#39;t stay on their boys to wash routinely and use appropriate personal care products &#45; will lead to larger issues with the kids as they run into peers who aren&#39;t shy about poking fun at their hygiene.&amp;nbsp; While the boys&#39; rooms can stink, it doesn&#39;t mean that they have to as well.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Little Change in April 2013</title>
<body>The PracticalDad Price Index of 47 grocery store items was finished and the Total Index of 107.29 showed little change from March&#39;s level of 107.24 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; When the ten non&#45;food items are removed, the Food&#45;only Index was likewise almost unchanged with April&#39;s 113.46 up slightly from the previous month level of 113.35.&amp;nbsp; This is the second month of a slight recovery after the three month drop that commenced from the Indices highs reached in December 2012.
While the monthly survey of the three unrelated stores was routine, one thing did jump out and I&#39;ll watch going forward to ascertain whether there&#39;s something happening or if it&#39;s just me.&amp;nbsp; There were two instances in which the typical products weren&#39;t on the shelves; this doesn&#39;t mean that the shelves were empty, but the shelf label that indicated that the item even existed on the shelf was completely missing.&amp;nbsp; This is on top of similar observations at isolated instances in the recent past.&amp;nbsp; With the knowledge that the median family income has dropped by 7.2% since December 2007&amp;nbsp; and the number of Americans on Food Stamps has now surpassed 50 million, there&#39;s simply less available for spending.&amp;nbsp; Understand that the number of different products available in groceries has risen significantly in the past several decades with a much greater variety now than was available when our grandparents went grocery shopping; but there are production costs with each product and a food manufacturer is going to begin to cull out those products which don&#39;t maximize profit on each production run.&amp;nbsp; Likewise with the grocer, who doesn&#39;t want unsold inventory sitting around, tying up cash.&amp;nbsp; I do know that one of the three grocery stores no longer sells bulk size boxes of diapers in the size that&#39;s used for the Index, although it keeps the smaller sized/higher margin product on the shelves.&amp;nbsp; This is the same store which stopped selling the Index formula (Enfamil Infant/23.4 oz) more than a year ago when it realized that the customer base simply wasn&#39;t buying it in sufficient amounts to justify keeping it stocked.&amp;nbsp; The long and short is that as incomes continue to drop and money is drained from the system, the variety to which we&#39;ve become used will drop as well.
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;Only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread

<title>Student Debt:&nbsp; Written Off Debt Doesn&#8217;t Mean It&#8217;s Gone&#8230;</title>
<body>Reuters recently reported that banks wrote off $3 Billion in student loans for the first two months of 2013, an increase of fully 36% higher than the same period last year.&amp;nbsp; While some will salivate, thinking that the bank is giving up on the loan and there&#39;s an opportunity to escape the stifling debtload, it&#39;s important to recognize one salient fact:&amp;nbsp; Debt that&#39;s been written off doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s gone or dead...it&#39;s just being reassigned.&amp;nbsp;
Many have now learned that student debt is different from other debt in that it cannot be discharged in bankruptcy; there is no clearing of the slate with the requisite hit to your credit history.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the crucial difference when you hear that a bank is writing off a student&#39;s debt versus any other person&#39;s debt.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate effect of a written off loan is that it&#39;s treated by the bank as an expense; it&#39;s considered as a cost of doing business and the net loss &#45; face value of the loan less any recoverable amount &#45; is deducted from revenue to determine the profit for the year.&amp;nbsp; So the banks are saying that they&#39;ve had enough on some loans and will write them off.&amp;nbsp; But the non&#45;dischargeable nature of the loan doesn&#39;t change and whoever buys that loan &#45; a so&#45;called vulture &#45; will accept the risk of non&#45;payment for the possibly greater return on the debt.&amp;nbsp; And the fact that this can haunt someone forever means that the vulture has considerable upside to the transaction since there&#39;s no alternative for bankruptcy.&amp;nbsp; So for the bank, it&#39;s an accounting transaction only and no relief for the student who&#39;s in arrears or default.
One of the lessons that I try to teach the kids is that things don&#39;t just happen, but there&#39;s frequently a reason for why, when and how they happen.&amp;nbsp; In this case, Bloomberg reported last week that Obama was cutting the collection agency commissions for student loans in default from 16% to 11%.&amp;nbsp; Prior to this announcement, a debt collector could receive up to 16% of the debt as commission if payments of a sufficient size were realized and it&#39;s this largesse that led to some of the well&#45;documented abuses noted over the past year.&amp;nbsp; With the President&#39;s action, the commission will decrease to 11% regardless of what&#39;s received, so the effect is to diminish the pressure tactics and abuses.&amp;nbsp; The second part of the why&#45;when&#45;how aspect is that some of the largest student collection agencies &#45; such as NCO and Pioneer Credit Recovery &#45; are subsidiaries of JPM Chase and Sallie Mae (SLM) respectively.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m not conversant with the arcane details of corporate accounting, I suspect that the write&#45;off involves a shifting of the debt to the subsidiary where it can be recovered at the still pertinent rate of 16% instead of the 11%.&amp;nbsp; The net effect is that the student debt write&#45;off has been simply front&#45;loaded and shifted as the parent corporations still profit and the students are still pursued.
So what&#39;s the takeaway from this?

    These bank write&#45;offs are irrelevant for the debtor as they&#39;re still responsible for the debt;
    This is just another piece of anecdotal evidence that the financial industry has an advanced view of what&#39;s going on within the present administration;
    While the news of larger write&#45;offs adds to pressure for further action to effectively address the entire issue of student debt, it&#39;s still incumbent upon the parents to help the kids figure out how to obtain the best education possible with the minimum amount of debt, if there has to be debt at all.

<title>The Takeaways on Cyprus</title>
<body>What exactly is Cyprus?&amp;nbsp; According to Wikipedia, it&#39;s a tiny island nation of approximately one million people located in the eastern Mediterrean.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the long&#45;term home of a small UN monitoring force that has been in place since the 1970s when Turkish troops invaded the island during a dispute between the Turkish&#45;descent Cypriots and Cypriots of Greek descent.&amp;nbsp; The response of most Americans during that time was The Turks invaded Cyprus?&amp;nbsp; What would they want with a tree?&amp;nbsp; But I now have a different response from a kitchen desk thousands of miles away and weeks after the journalists descended. &amp;nbsp;Despite the multitude of articles about what all of it means, there are three simple takeaways and none involve alphabetic European mechanisms.
The core issue around Cyprus is how to pay for additional bailouts for insolvent institutions that &#45; like occurred in Iceland &#45; threaten to drag down the economy.&amp;nbsp; The government was offered over 10 billion Euros as a bailout by the &amp;quot;Troika&amp;quot; (the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank) but a quid pro quo for the bailout was that the Cypriots themselves had to put up a certain percentage of that money; and if you&#39;re looking for money in the first place, how do you come up with money?&amp;nbsp; When someone once asked John Dillinger why he robbed banks, he retorted because that&#39;s where the money is and the eyes went to the banks themselves because, well...that&#39;s where the money was.&amp;nbsp; But the only money in the banks, which needed money to survive, was with the people who actually used the banks for deposits &#45; the customers.&amp;nbsp; So the first proposal was that the bank depositors, people like us who simply deposit our paychecks in the various saving accounts, wouldbe legally required to &amp;quot;contribute&amp;quot; a specific percentage of their savings deposits to the bank to keep the bank afloat and there was no hope of any return of that money.&amp;nbsp; In terms that stuff&#45;happy Americans will understand, if the owner of the storage rental units ran into financial problems, he could legally get out of the scrape by simply confiscating and selling 20% of the stuff that people store in their units.&amp;nbsp; When the Cypriot parliament unequivocably nixed the plan, the Cypriot Prime Minister and Finance Minister met with the Troika representatives and pulled a sleight&#45;of&#45;hand manuever that bypassed the need for the legislature&#39;s approval for implementation. By the wave of the magic administrative wand, the depositors suddenly found themselves creditors.
You need to understand that there is a hierarchy to the ownership of any corporate entity, banks included, and this hierarchy is layered by exposure to risk.&amp;nbsp; The core of any corporation is the capital put there by the investors but not all investors are created equal and if the firm has major problems, the investors will lose their money; but there are levels at which capital is exhausted.&amp;nbsp; The shareholders of the stock have the greatest volatility of return and are lowest in the hierarchy; congratulations, you could really do way better than the bondholders but that&#39;s at the risk of a wipeout.&amp;nbsp; The next level of the hierarchy, whose money is protected in terms of wipeout by the shareholders, are the unsecured creditors.&amp;nbsp; These are folks who lend to the bank and expect to have their money repaid, but their lending isn&#39;t protected by any claim on collateral.&amp;nbsp; The next level are the bondholders and even they aren&#39;t equal as the Junior bondholders &#45; presumably named Skip, Corky and Brittani  &#45; come before the Senior bondholders.&amp;nbsp; The difference between the two is that the interest paid on the bonds is higher for the Juniors than the Seniors with the extra money meaning that they bear the higher risk if things truly go south and the capital is threatened.&amp;nbsp; What the new plan did was to magically alter the status of the depositors, promoting them from simple customers to an actual place in the ownership hierarchy as unsecured creditors who&#39;ve now apparently lent money to the bank by dint of simply opening an account and getting the free toaster (if we were in Spain, we&#39;d actually be getting a Spiderman towel &#45; no crap).&amp;nbsp; Were this happening here, we&#39;d suddenly find ourselves on the hook for our own bank, even if all we did was open an account.&amp;nbsp; The hit was minimized for people by making it only for account&#45;holders with more than 100,000 Euros in their accounts, which in Cyprus meant that the majority of those accountholders were Russians using Cyprus for an offshore tax&#45;haven.&amp;nbsp; See, the only people who have to worry are those nasty Nouveau&#45;Riche Russians who earned their money via kleptocracy...
Both takeaways are inextricably linked to debt levels.&amp;nbsp; The first takeaway of this story is that the financial/political leadership is aware that the debt levels are too high and is looking for new pools of money to tap into to help ease the debt burden.&amp;nbsp; But those pools now seen are with the savers, those who have continually set aside money to provide for themselves, and those pools are within the banks.&amp;nbsp; There are trillions of dollars and Euros in banks that can be used but there has to be a means to access them and the Cyprus situation is the first effort to gain access to those pools of funds.&amp;nbsp; Because we have yet to see a door close once it&#39;s been opened, expect that the entry will be widened as the situation worsens; the likelihood exists that it will not only geographically spread across borders to this country, but that it will spread across product lines to pension funds, 401ks and IRAs.&amp;nbsp; There has been a brushfire war against savings in our consumption based economy and this carries it to a new level as the search continues for funds.
The second takeaway is that we now serve the system instead of the system serving us. &amp;nbsp; Politics and money are inextricably linked and the present political&#45;economic structure now exists to serve itself at the cost of the individual, whose voice resides in the legislature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When the Cypriot legislature voted down the initial proposal, it was altered so that it no longer required legislative approval and summarily implemented against the will of the people.&amp;nbsp; Several years ago, Iceland&#39;s legislature told the political&#45;economic structure to pound sand and opted to take the economic hit without a bailout.&amp;nbsp; It was allowed to do so because it didn&#39;t use the Euro and it&#39;s collapse wasn&#39;t injurious to the European financial structure.&amp;nbsp; But because of Cyprus&#39; status as a member of the European Community and it&#39;s use of the Euro, failure was not deemed to be an option.&amp;nbsp; A Cypriot scenario already occurred in the United States in late 2008.&amp;nbsp; After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Bush Administration proposed a bailout and was rebuffed by Congress; but it went back again and when the Treasury Secretary warned of possible martial law should it fail.&amp;nbsp; With the apparent fear that Stryker Assault Vehicles would take up too many parking spaces at the neighborhood convenience stores, Congress folded and approved TARP.&amp;nbsp;
The third takeaway is that any action here will be clothed in terms of class&#45;warfare.&amp;nbsp; As measures are implemented that access privately held funds, the refrain for the masses will be that it&#39;s against the rich alone.&amp;nbsp; The middle class and poor will supposedly be protected, but the definition of who is rich will be arbitrary and will ultimately shift downwards as the dysfunction continues and the rot deepens.&amp;nbsp; Again, the first efforts are being made as the proposed budget by President Obama proposes limits to how much &amp;quot;the wealthy&amp;quot; can keep in IRAs.&amp;nbsp; But the fact is that there&#39;s now an overt definition of wealthy and a unilateral presumption that they don&#39;t have the right to have more there than a specific amount.&amp;nbsp; This is the economic equivalent of German theologian Martin Niemoller&#39;s famous comment:&amp;nbsp;
First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out&#45;&#45; Because I was not a Socialist.  Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out&#45;&#45; Because I was not a Trade Unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out&#45;&#45; Because I was not a Jew.  Then they came for me&#45;&#45;and there was no one left to speak for me.
So...first, they came for Cyprus, and I cared nothing...</body>

<title>What Do We Owe Our Elders?</title>
<body>As men take on greater family and personal responsibilities, one of the things that they&#39;ll find is that, like women, they&#39;re generationally sandwiched between childcare and eldercare.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case as men marry at a later age and father children at a later age as well.&amp;nbsp; If women are spending greater amounts of time in the workforce and men are consequently taking on greater responsibility in the household, then it follows that men will also begin to take a greater role in caring for their elderly parents as well.&amp;nbsp; If you thought that just managing the younger generation was tough, wait until the elder generation is thrown into the mix.&amp;nbsp; But our society is beginning a wrenching change as the social care network has to come to terms &#45; like the rest of society &#45; with the fact that promises made are greater than the resources available to satisfy them.&amp;nbsp; As this reframes our thinking, we need to ask ourselves a basic question:&amp;nbsp; what do owe our elders?
The question is both simple and truly profound as we are forced to confront the promises/resources issue.&amp;nbsp; Economic uncertainty breeds fear and a look overseas to economically troubled Japan and England &#45; each with far more debt than we have &#45; bears that out.&amp;nbsp; In January, the Japanese Deputy Prime Minister forcefully suggested that the elderly &amp;quot;hurry up and die&amp;quot; so as to not expend further medical and economic resources; he has since modified his stance after realizing that if the Japanese took his comments to heart, they&#39;d wind up with a country that&#39;s not only Montana&#39;s geographic size but population density as well.&amp;nbsp; In October 2010, a governor of the Bank of England stated that the elderly there would have to accommodate low interest rates and spend down their savings for the common good; the notion that it should be left intact for future generations is no longer operative as the national resources dwindle in the face of overwhelming liabilities.&amp;nbsp; My sense is that the major difference between these two nations and our own is only that of a few years, so what they&#39;re encountering now is what we&#39;ll encounter within a few years.&amp;nbsp; On a different track, there is a new and growing push by the aging baby&#45;boomers to advocate for physician&#45;assisted suicide in the following states &#45; Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont.&amp;nbsp; There are two notable factors about these states.&amp;nbsp; The first is that while the median age of an American is 36.8 years, the median age is lower in only Arizona and Kansas.&amp;nbsp; The other notable factor is that of these states, only Arizona and Montana are running without a deficit and Arizona just returned to the black after being hard hit in the 2007 downturn.&amp;nbsp; Coupling this information provides some insight that aging boomers envision a bleak future at odds with their here&#45;to&#45;fore free&#45;wheeling generational ways and are looking to legalized suicide as an alternative to that path.&amp;nbsp; While there&#39;s no hard evidence to support it, it&#39;s also probable that the proponents are looking at the outsized cost of end&#45;of&#45;life medical care and wishing to save their families the bills.
I believe wholly in the Bell Curve and how it can be applied to so much of the world around us.&amp;nbsp; If applied to an average person&#39;s life and encompasses the totality of the person &#45; physical, intellectual, emotional &#45; then it starts the ascent from the left bound and continues upwards until reaching a point in mid&#45;life at which the person is at the peak of their capacities; as they age from that point, the slope descends until death is reached at the end of a long life.&amp;nbsp; Some curves end prematurely due to an early death, but the analogy holds for people as a whole.&amp;nbsp; This Family Bell Curve was the operative model for much of American history as three or more generations lived together in a single household where they could assist one another as they were able.&amp;nbsp; But this model broke after the Second World War as families began to migrate, with adult children moving for personal or professional reasons.&amp;nbsp; Even the newly affluent elderly moved to climes more conducive to their health and preferences and the result was that a three generational norm decreased to a two generational model, aka the nuclear family. &amp;nbsp; The affluence of the past three generations made this break survivable as tax revenues were steered by savvy politicians to create social programs that aided the elderly who were in one place while their families were often elsewhere and the Social Security program was expanded far beyond what FDR and the Great Depression&#45;era legislators ever envisioned.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;ve gone beyond recession and our present real resources &#45; not the paper and electronic digits emanating from the Federal Reserve &#45; will neither the promises made nor the programs created.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
As we truly begin to renegotiate the generational contracts in a period  of lesser resources, what do we owe our elders?&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly, it&#39;s not  very different from what we owe our children.&amp;nbsp; We parents are now astride the peak of the Bell Curve as we raise ascendant children on one hand and support declining parents on the other and what we owe is applicable on either slope. &amp;nbsp;

    We owe them our respect, even if we realize when we become the adults that they possess their own character flaws that might make them individuals with whom we&#39;d not associate were they not our parents.&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t mean to kow&#45;tow, but it does mean that barring grossly deficient behavior, they deserve to be acknowledged as the people who raised us and brought us up into the world, worthy of our own support.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps once you more completely understand their own flaws, you can better appreciate what they might have accomplished in your own upbringing.
    We owe them our time.&amp;nbsp; This commodity has been stretched as more families turn to multiple part&#45;time jobs to make the ends meet and is increasingly precious for many parents.&amp;nbsp; But the medical and bureaucratic system that we&#39;ve created is complicated and opaque, difficult to understand from the outside and full of programs that seemingly overlap and confuse as to who they serve.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s difficult for those of us who are comfortable with the technological accesses &#45; automated prescription renewal plans for example &#45; but it can be overwhelming and fearful for those who are hard of hearing or recognize their own failing&amp;nbsp; faculties.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that we have to be ready to provide the time to help them navigate these systems at the least, and physically assist them if necessary.
    We owe them our conversation.&amp;nbsp; The elderly often have little more than the media to occupy their time and there are commentators on either side of the spectrum who make a bundle from propagating fear and division, separating us from them.&amp;nbsp; Our words can be the oil that calms their water and we should provide the time to listen and explain.&amp;nbsp; The unspoken part of this is that we ourselves have to take an interest in what&#39;s occurring around us so that we ourselves understand what&#39;s going on around us.
    We owe them our support, whether it might be financial, physical or otherwise.&amp;nbsp; My own parents sent money each month to my paternal grandmother, who managed to accumulate an astonishing quantity of cosmetics and costume jewelry in her lifetime.&amp;nbsp; If my own parents are financially sound, I can still work in other ways to support them, such as attending medical appointments so that confusion is minimized on the part of both doctor and elder.&amp;nbsp; Likewise with repairs around the place, such as what my brother&#45;in&#45;law and sister did with my mother.
    We owe them our adulthood.&amp;nbsp; Advancing age brings difficult decisions and a person of declining capabilities can find them both terrifying and depressing and it requires our input to help them navigate these decisions.&amp;nbsp; But some affect not just the elder, but also others and these others can include complete strangers; the status of an elder&#39;s driver&#39;s license is a case in point as the loss of independence brings their decline and eventual death into concrete and clear perspective.&amp;nbsp; Being an adult means that you have to consider more than just your own self&#45;interest, but also the wider aspects, as difficult as they may be.

What frames my own thinking on what I owe my elders is also this, as self&#45;interested as it may appear.&amp;nbsp; My job is to teach my children via word and action.&amp;nbsp; I know that I&#39;m being watched and that the kids are taking their own lessons from how I proceed; while I can preach about what I have to do, it&#39;s crucial that they actually see me do it as well.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s vitally important for my wife and I that they see a working model in action because the time will come when they&#39;re astride the Curve and we&#39;re descending.&amp;nbsp; And the programs that presently exist will likely be curtailed.</body>

<title>File Away for Future Reference&#8230;Under &#8216;C&#8217; for Cyprus (w/Duplicate to &#8216;I&#8217; for Italy)</title>
<body>Big things happen in some of the most obscure places and the biggie this weekend came out of the tiny Mediterrean island nation of Cyprus.&amp;nbsp; It was followed a day later by a German bank economist&#39;s opinion that a similar event would be of benefit in Italy.&amp;nbsp; The two are big precisely for their attack upon private property rights and the possibility of what could &#45; someday &#45; come to a bank near you.
The word came out Saturday morning that the Cypriot government, in order to qualify for an EU bailout, ordered the forced recapitalization of Cypriot banks by unilaterally charging all Cypriot bank depositors a percentage of their savings held in the banks.&amp;nbsp; Any Cypriot with less than 100,000 Euros in the bank had 6.75% of their savings transferred to a bank recapitalization account; those with greater than savings of 100,000 Euros had 9.9% of their funds taken.&amp;nbsp; The fact that it was called a tax with the promise that it was &amp;quot;one&#45;time&amp;quot; only doesn&#39;t hide the fact that it was a wholesale confiscation by the sovereign in support of the banking system.&amp;nbsp; As I write this, the Cypriot parliament is holding up the process but the issue doesn&#39;t seem to be whether or not it&#39;s happening, but instead the extent to which the poorer savers will be shaved versus the wealthier savers.&amp;nbsp; There will be talk of fairness in the hope that the rhetoric obscures the action and dampens the outrage of the common Cypriot.&amp;nbsp; In the Italian case, a German bank economist stated that a &amp;quot;one&#45;time&amp;quot; wealth tax &#45; a confiscation &#45; of a percentage of all Italian savings would do wonders for the level of the Italian national debt, bringing it down to manageable levels and relieving the pressure upon the Italian government.&amp;nbsp;
The fact that each is supposedly a &amp;quot;one&#45;time&amp;quot; occurrence &#45; actual and proposed &#45; is meaningless.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that any European government can conceivably subvert long&#45;held laws of private property in order to support a system that is undeniably broken.&amp;nbsp; Even if the money were used to pay for the bailouts, there is no change to the situation which causes the need for the bailout.&amp;nbsp; Even if spending were brought under control to maintenance levels, the hit to a nation&#39;s GDP will keep the debt/GDP ratio high as the denominator shrinks.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s no guarantee that such an event will occur in this country, but be assured that the European approach is being closely watched by some here.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s demagoguery and fear&#45;mongering now over the sequestration that affects only 2% of federal spending.&amp;nbsp; If our elected leaders won&#39;t even issue a budget and are this cowardly now, wait until we&#39;re further down the road of insolvency; it&#39;s conceivable that the fear of alienating factional supporters would drive our own government to summarily confiscate our savings to &amp;quot;put our house in order&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; But that omits the simple fact that they&#39;re wholly unable to control their spending and it will ultimately not be a one&#45;time occurrence as they have to revisit that particular well again.&amp;nbsp; Assuming that everyone hasn&#39;t simply fled the financial system entirely.&amp;nbsp;
As I said, there is no guarantee that such an event will happen here, but it&#39;s still instructive to watch the events unfolding in Europe to learn from their mistakes.&amp;nbsp; The biggest lesson of all however, is that generations of economic lessons to children are now turned on their heads as the war on savers moves from subtle actions to overt, threatening ones.

<title>1837 Redux</title>
<body>I believe that there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by the gradual and silent encroachment of those in power, than by sudden usurpation.&amp;nbsp; (James Madison, speech, Virginia Convention, 1788)
I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale. (Thomas Jefferson, letter to John Taylor, 1816)
It has been urged as an argument in favor of rechartering the present bank that the calling in its loans will produce great embarrassment and distress.&amp;nbsp; The time allowed to close its concerns is ample, and if it has been well managed its pressure will be light, and heavy only in case its management has been bad.&amp;nbsp; If, therefore, it shall produce distress, the fault will be its own, and it would furnish a reason against renewing a power which has been so obviously abused.&amp;nbsp; But will there ever be a time when this reason wil be less powerful?&amp;nbsp; To acknowledge its force is to admit that the bank ought to be perpetual, and as a consequence the present stockholders and those inheriting their rights as successors be established a privileged order, clothed both with great political power and enjoying immense pecuniary advantages from their connection with the Government.&amp;nbsp; (Andrew Jackson, Veto Message to Congress on the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, Paragraph 9, 1832)
It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes.&amp;nbsp; Distinctions in society will always exist under every just government.&amp;nbsp; Equality of talents, of education, or of wealth can not be produced by human institutions.&amp;nbsp; In the full enjoyment of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privilieges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society &#45; the famers, mechanics, and laborers &#45; who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government.&amp;nbsp; There are no necessary evils in government.&amp;nbsp; Its evils exist only in its abuses.&amp;nbsp; If it would confine itself to equal protection, and, as Heaven does its rains, shower its favors alike on the high and the low, the rich and the poor, it would be an unqualified blessing.&amp;nbsp; In the act before me there seems to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principles. (Andrew Jackson, Veto Message to Congress on the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, Paragraph 44, 1832)
Whoever controls the volume of money in our country is absolute master  of all industry and commerce...when you realize that the entire system  is very easily controlled, one way or another, by a few powerful men at  the top, you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and  depression originate. (James A, Garfield, President)
I personally feel that it&#39;s my duty to consider whether individual employees with no responsibility for, or knowledge of, misconduct committed by others in the same company are going to lose their livelihood if we indict the corporation.&amp;nbsp; In large multi&#45;national companies, the jobs of tens of thousands of employees can be at stake.&amp;nbsp; And in some cases, the health of an industry or the markets are a real factor.&amp;nbsp; Those are the kinds of considerations in white collar crime cases that literally keep me up at night, and which must play a role in responsible enforcement. (Lanny Breuer, Assistant United States Attorney General, speech to the New York Bar Association, 9/13/12)
I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.&amp;nbsp; And I think that is a function of the fact that some of the these institutions have become too large. (Eric Holder, United States Attorney General, Senate Testimony, 3/6/13)
The crucial point to be taken from the aforementioned quotes is that there&#39;s been a long&#45;standing distrust of, and tension between, our government and those within the financial sector.&amp;nbsp; The Founding Fathers wished a government that avoided the pitfalls of their European forebears; hand&#45;in&#45;hand with the despotic nature of uncontrolled royalty was the power and influence gained by the financiers who did business with the royalty.&amp;nbsp; But a nation needs a cohesive financial sector and it&#39;s there that the ongoing tension occurs as the human tendency to garner wealth and power comes into the nation&#39;s need to rein in such impulses.&amp;nbsp;
This tension reached a crisis point in Jackson&#39;s administration with the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States, run by Nicholas Biddle.&amp;nbsp; There was no functioning central bank and it was Biddle&#39;s bank which filled the gap by providing credit to smaller banks, based upon the strength of the deposits placed in his bank by the United States government.&amp;nbsp; But the first real instance of private ambition versus national interest occurred when Biddle began to pressure Jackson for renewal of his congressional charter by withdrawing credit from the smaller banks, causing some to collapse with the resultant loss of the depositors&#39; funds.&amp;nbsp; Jackson met that action by weakening Biddle by unilaterally withdrawing the government&#39;s deposits so that Biddle was unable to extend credit to anybody &#45; insuring a banking system collapse and the Depression of 1837.&amp;nbsp; Jackson knew the result was fore&#45;ordained, yet he did it anyway because to fail would be to surrender the government&#39;s power to one individual, who would have final say on anything to his interest to the exclusion of the greater good.&amp;nbsp;
American society lives in the moment, a wonderful quality if it means that you forget the slights and feuds that propel much of the rest of the world but problematic since we forget the lessons of our history.&amp;nbsp; Financial issues continued to abound in any number of ways &#45; bi&#45;metallism, gold standard, periodic booms&#45;and&#45;busts &#45; but the issue of Jackson&#39;s day has been quiet until a rebirth with the financial deregulation in the 1990s.&amp;nbsp; This was the moment when Reagan&#39;s mantra government is the problem, not the solution went awry and we forgot that government also serves to regulate the worser angels of our nature.&amp;nbsp; We again went through booms but these were contained by an abundantly easy monetary policy, the equivalent of trying to cure cancer with copious amounts of morphine.&amp;nbsp; The unrestrained financial sector behaved like something out of A Clockwork Orange, mugging passersby and bragging about it until the crisis of 2008 when they found themselves in a web that would require sovereign intervention, courtesy of the US Congress and the Federal Reserve.&amp;nbsp; But the best response from a new president would have been a re&#45;institution of financial regulation and a crackdown upon the behaviors that drove us to the crisis brink; instead, trillions of dollars were spent to prop up the financial sector with no curb on the behaviors.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve now found that the large banks &#45; Too Big to Fail &#45; conspired to fix LIBOR while JPM not only lied to their own risk management staff, but lied up the line to the point that Jamie Dimon lied in testimony to the Senate Select Committee.&amp;nbsp; Goldman routinely does the opposite of what it advises its own client base and money flows throught the proprietary trading desks to float the stock indices divorced from reality.&amp;nbsp; And the levels of derivative products &#45; which ratchets up the damage levels should this happen again &#45; have risen significantly.
In his speech and interview, former AG Lanny Breuer promoted the notion that while there have been no indictments against any of the entities, there have been indictments of certain individuals; a recurrent thread of commentary is that it&#39;s sooooo hard to get a criminal indictment, that the level of proof required makes it almost impossible whereas the civil route simply requires a level beyond a reasonable doubt.&amp;nbsp; He further acknowledged &#45; and this is what caused him to leave &#45; that he views the prospect of criminal prosecturion through the lens of collateral damage to the economy; about six weeks later, his boss, Attorney General Eric Holder, also acknowledged that he&#39;s concerned about prosecution of the TBTF entities for fear of collateral damage to the economy.&amp;nbsp;
And here&#39;s where we get back to Jackson and the Second Bank of the United States.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s one thing to pursue individuals, but what if the collective culture of the corporate entities is so pervasively corrupt that the present approach is akin to swatting at individual flies when you&#39;re being swarmed?&amp;nbsp; These acknowledgements by our top Justice officials reveal that the TBTF management actively operates under the cold war doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, in which outrageous behavior occurs with the understanding that punishment will be muted at best for fear that some plug will be pulled and the entire structure pulled down.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve burdened ourselves with trillions in additional debt and begun a dollar debauch that will ultimately result in a global currency shift; average investors are lured back into a market in which they stand a significantly higher risk of loss with biased information provided by the institutions.&amp;nbsp; Jackson understood that there was going to be tremendous damage from his stance, but that the rule of law and the common good required that action be taken or the Constitution and nation would be subverted and stunted.&amp;nbsp; Control of the nation&#39;s interests would be effectively turned over to one person and the history and strides of the past six decades would be nullified.&amp;nbsp; What would have happened to our nation&#39;s history had power ultimately rested with the monied Nicholas Biddle?&amp;nbsp; Would there have been a Civil War?&amp;nbsp; Would there have been an Emancipation Proclamation?
The point is this.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s going to be any significant improvement to the real economy, if there&#39;s going to be a meaningful return to the rule of law, then we have to accept the prospect of real economic pain.&amp;nbsp; But there continues to be promise to our country if we &#45; our legislators and regulators included &#45; are willing to call the bluff.&amp;nbsp; The TBTF management will otherwise continue to operate in a realm that&#39;s  unchecked with the expectation that all losses and illegalities will be  covered until the nation is effectively ruined.&amp;nbsp; A failure to do so will result in a certain slow death of hope for our youngsters, trapping them in the same semi&#45;employed, unsupportable and truly hopeless state in which their European peers find themselves.&amp;nbsp; Jackson understood that he owed a responsiblity to future generations of Americans.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s time that our leaders recognize the same.

<title>Family Values</title>
<body>If you listen to the media, then you hear the recurrent phrase family values emanating from the conservative side of the spectrum.&amp;nbsp; The values &#45; faith in God, respect for elders and institutions, love of country, thrift and the like &#45; are packaged by the media in a shiny, neat red&#45;state bow and the sense is that they are so inter&#45;related that the removal of any one of them leads to a yellowing and early expiration date for the remainder.&amp;nbsp; But parents should decide early on what other values they wish to instill in the kids along with the mainstays; this is especially the case as there can be an effect on the family budget and distinct choices must be made if they&#39;re to be pursued.
In our case, we decided early on that travel and exposure to the great, wide world was important for the kids.&amp;nbsp; Our wish is to inculcate in them the understanding that there are experiences and vistas beyond the confines of a small town and that there was great value to partaking of them.&amp;nbsp; The reality however, is that this is a value that costs money with an impact upon our daily lives.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve managed to get around part of the cost by tacking vacations onto business trips so that my wife&#39;s airfare and some of our lodging was covered by the employer.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve managed larger trips by overtly saving each month and refusing certain kid requests by simply uttering the name of the proposed location.&amp;nbsp; Other choices made overtly support the travel value, such as driving used cars &#45; we&#39;ve had three cars towed away for salvage in our marriage &#45; and refusing to hire anybody to do jobs that we can conceivably do ourselves, such as landscaping, yard and housework.&amp;nbsp; When I was working to finish a lengthy outdoor project with assistance from Middle, I was glad to hear him say that we probably do more around our own house than most of our neighbors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
There are other values that we work to instill with the kids and that continues even when they&#39;re well into the teen years.&amp;nbsp; Do your best.&amp;nbsp; Understand that debt is as much a dangerous tool as a powersaw, badly damaging if not used with respect and thought.&amp;nbsp; Question what you hear.&amp;nbsp; Treat the media&#39;s messages with skepticism.&amp;nbsp; Some will look at the last two and wonder whether these are actually true values, which are usually associated with virtues; I&#39;d argue that when the message coming from the prevailing media and society is ultimately harmful, then valuing skepticism and free thought is indeed a virtue by itself.
That&#39;s the key part of purposefully working to instill values with the kids.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re certainly going to get the prevailing values from the media, and even if you work to control the electronic media, they&#39;ll still get hear those values from their friends. Think what matters to you and then begin the lengthy process of constant reinforcement so that the kids aren&#39;t overwhelmed by the negative values of the prevailing culture.</body>

<title>Just What is Inflation?</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
VLADIMIR:  (gloomily). It&#39;s too much for one man. (Pause. Cheerfully.)  On the other hand what&#39;s the good of losing heart now, that&#39;s what I  say. We should have thought of it a million years ago, in the nineties.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Waiting for Godot (Samuel Beckett, 1949)
Vladimir is one of the protagonists in Beckett&#39;s absurdist classic Waiting for Godot, the tale of two men who are simply waiting for the arrival of Godot.&amp;nbsp; We never see Godot, but we know that he&#39;s expected and it&#39;s precisely this play that reminds me of the ongoing debate of whether global monetary policies &#45; the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank &#45; will foster the inflationary environment that&#39;s been predicted; an environment feared by some and hoped for by others.&amp;nbsp; But just as the audience wonders about Godot &#45; who he is and what he looks like &#45; so there are some who wonder likewise about inflation.&amp;nbsp; Just what is inflation and what is the cause?&amp;nbsp; Likewise, what is this deflation that&#39;s so greatly feared by the central banks?

<title>Teachable Moments:&nbsp; The $1 Renewal</title>
<body>I live for teachable moments, those instances when you can take an occurrence and turn it into a small lesson.&amp;nbsp; Some are spur of the moment and some are items that I keep and set aside for later use; today&#39;s mail just provided one of the latter category, an offer from ESPN magazine for a special $1 annual renewal if I use my credit card.&amp;nbsp;
One of my axioms is the simple if it&#39;s too good to be true, it&#39;s too good to be true and my eyes floated to the small print &#45; what the big print giveth, the small print taketh away &#45; to look for the answer.&amp;nbsp; On the upper right corner, several font sizes below the large BEST RENEWAL DEAL! message was Note:&amp;nbsp; Your subscription will have Automatic Renewal benefits.&amp;nbsp; See back for details. The upshot of the offer is that if I&#39;m willing to give them my credit card number, then they&#39;ll renew for $1 but the renewal will be ad infinitum at the prevailing rates.&amp;nbsp; It will certainly be possible to cancel, but the reality is that enough people are either too lazy or stupid to bother trying to walk through the steps and the corporate loss incurred on the offer will be easily overcome by the much greater revenue from the automatic renewals.&amp;nbsp;
I subscribed to ESPN last year for both my benefit and that of Youngest, who is &#45; as labeled by Eldest &#45; the family&amp;nbsp; jock.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s actually read in the household and will become even moreso as baseball season takes hold and it&#39;s entirely possible that it will be renewed when the subscription expires in about six months.&amp;nbsp; That said, the offer is something that I&#39;ll share with the kids since I want them to view life with a healthy dose of skepticism.&amp;nbsp; The lessons, in a bite&#45;size format, are:

    If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is too good to be true.&amp;nbsp; Great offers usually come with strings attached and while there&#39;s a short&#45;term benefit to you, there&#39;s a longer&#45;term benefit to someone else.
    What the big print giveth, the small print taketh away.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a point to read every contract and especially so in the presence of the kids.&amp;nbsp; There have been instances when I&#39;ve purposefully slowed down the process by reading a contract in their presence just to make a point.&amp;nbsp; In this instance, I&#39;ll share the location of the small print so that they can see it after viewing the obvious big print.
    Is this the kind of purchase for which a credit card is used?&amp;nbsp; This is purely a judgment call and if you&#39;ve got a points reward card, you might say that it&#39;s entirely appropriate.
    Are you certain that this magazine is something that you&#39;ll want to read indefinitely?&amp;nbsp; Can you presently afford it on any budget that you might have?
    If you have to cancel it in the future, is it easy to do so?&amp;nbsp; Some organizations have special hoops that must be jumped through in order to actually cancel it.

There might be other items that will come up in conversation and we&#39;ll cross that bridge if necessary.&amp;nbsp; But for now, the offer will take up residence on the kitchen island and await the arrival of the kids.</body>

<title>Politics, Current Events and Kids</title>
<body>I&#39;m writing this as Senator Rand Paul (R&#45;KY) is engaged in the eighth hour of his Senate filibuster to stall the vote on John Brennan for the directorship of the CIA.&amp;nbsp; As happened during Senator Bernie Sanders&#39; 2010 filibuster, I took the opportunity to play a short live&#45;feed for Middle before the family gathered for dinner; Youngest, Eldest and Eldest&#39;s boyfriend were still not upstairs for the meal.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, I did make it a point to spend a fair part of the dinner to explain multiple aspects of the political event.
There&#39;s an age differential of eight years between Eldest and Youngest and in such a conversation, it&#39;s helpful to lay the groundwork because a filibuster isn&#39;t an everyday thing (the last one was Senator Bernie Sanders&#39; filibuster in late 2010).&amp;nbsp; From there, the conversation moved through to other questions and it was eye&#45;opening to find what they did and didn&#39;t know.&amp;nbsp: What is a filibuster?&amp;nbsp; What is a drone, why are they used and how extensively are they used?&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s easy to say that overseas drone strikes are being used on terrorists, who&#39;s defining who that particular person is and does it matter whether that person is an American citizen?&amp;nbsp; An unspoken question that ran through my head was whether or not the US government would have attempted to assassinate Tokyo Rose, the American collaborator who broadcast for the Japanese during the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; As the conversation progressed, I moved it to the heart of the matter, which is whether the President should be allowed to unilaterally decide what American should be summarily executed either abroad or in this country.&amp;nbsp; One of the kids commented that the President should be able to do what was necessary to protect the country but the conversation swung back to the idea of due process; if the President believes that something should be done &#45; especially to citizens in this nation &#45; shouldn&#39;t there be some process that must be engaged first?&amp;nbsp; We already force due process for searches and wiretaps, isn&#39;t it in the least bit reasonable to force the executive to prove cause for the taking of a life?
The issue beside that of due process for the proposed potential death of an American citizen was whether drones were a legitimate tool for domestic activity or whether they&#39;re Big Brother overkill; how much should we be surveilled?&amp;nbsp; Because I believe that the best lessons learned are those that link the larger issues to local life, I brought up the topic of nearby downtown surveillance cameras.&amp;nbsp; We live near a city which is heavily surveilled, with widespread camera usage through the downtown area and frankly, one of the most surveilled in the nation.&amp;nbsp; Who owns the cameras and who monitors them?&amp;nbsp; Who paid for the cameras and their installations and when one response was &quot;tax dollars&quot;, the kid gave an incredulous look when he learned that they were all covered via private funding.&amp;nbsp; How long are the tapes kept and who oversees the people overseeing the monitors?&amp;nbsp; Does an unknown person have the right to literally follow us on our way around the city?&amp;nbsp; My wife shot me a look as the kids laughed when I admitted that I&#39;ve occasionally walked past a camera and flipped it off out of sheer annoyance at their ubiquitous presence; we condemn the use of the middle finger and have punished kids for it, but my response was that in this particular situation, it was a legitimate expression of free speech that registered my displeasure at their use.
The point is this.&amp;nbsp; Take every opportunity to engage the kids in current events and teach them.&amp;nbsp; Start with the basics and then build upwards from there, fleshing out their understanding and tying as many loose ends back to the beginning as possible.&amp;nbsp; Keep the personal invective to a minimum and give them as many facts as possible; they&#39;ll get a good handle on what you think by your conversation but if you think it necessary, save your full opinion for the end and in that case, make it abundantly clear with plain, straightforward language.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s our job to prepare them for the world and thinking that they&#39;ll get a good grasp elsewhere is a critical error.</body>

<title>BSA  or BS(g)A(y)?</title>
<body>The Boy Scouts of America recently announced that the long&#45;awaited decision on whether to allow gay men and women to serve as scout leaders would be postponed until May of 2013. This decision was met with considerable derision of the gay community and supporters &#45; it was even mocked by Seth Meyers on SNL &#45; who see the issue as another element of social justice; for them, it&#39;s a no&#45;brainer and the delay is simply the reticence of an antiquated old&#45;guard who refuse to yield to what they deem to be morally right.&amp;nbsp; But reality is never as simple as we would wish, especially in the sound&#45;bite/bit&#45;byte age when issues are shortened to catch phrases that serve as ultimately serve as much intellectual value as a Burma Shave sign.&amp;nbsp; What are the issues &#45; and potential consequences &#45; that national scout leadership must walk through in making a decision about gay scout leaders?
Full Disclosure:&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been a scout&#45;leader for ten years, serving at the request of two sons; as Youngest leaves the cub scout level, he&#39;s asked that I continue on with him as an adult leader at the boy scout level (5th grade and upwards).&amp;nbsp;
The debate over gay scout leadership is an example of what occurs when ideologues &#45; on both sides &#45; take up a debate without any real understanding of how an affected organization actually works.&amp;nbsp; There has been public pressure brought by gay rights activists for years over the issue and with considerable success.&amp;nbsp; Multiple large cities and school districts have withdrawn support for the organization with a resultant loss in terms of financing and logistics; in Philadelphia for example, the city sought &#45; and finally lost in court &#45; to evict the local scout council from it&#39;s headquaters &#45; privately owned but on city land with a perpetual $1 annual lease &#45; unless it permitted gay leadership. Apart from this legal defeat, other cities and districts have refused permission to use facilities.&amp;nbsp; Corporations have quietly removed sponsorship for the organization and its events with a resulting loss in funding, and in some cities, the United Way has removed the BSA from it&#39;s umbrella of supported organizations.&amp;nbsp; As recently as last week, Carly Rae Jepsen joined the band Train in boycotting a national scouting event for which she was scheduled to sing this summer.&amp;nbsp; The tide of public opinion would certainly appear to flow against the present BSA stance.
But why do they want additional time to sort things through?&amp;nbsp; The reasons are partly due to internal culture, tragic history and the organization&#39;s infrastructure at the local level.&amp;nbsp;
Internal Culture
The BSA was founded in 1910 by Lord Baden&#45;Powell in England, and it was created as an organization to create men of character.&amp;nbsp; Baden&#45;Powell created it with structure and ranks partly because of his own previous military experience and the understanding that boys best grew into good men when they were challenged.&amp;nbsp; It came out of a different cultural time in which homosexuality was universally condemned and for an organization that concerned itself with helping create good men &#45; the concept of manhood &#45; any challenge to the notion of manhood was a shot to the heart.&amp;nbsp; Change doesn&#39;t always come easily and in our short&#45;attention span age, the notion that an organization will easily alter its founding conception of manhood is frankly naive; in terms of history, four decades &#45; the timespan since the Stonewall riots &#45; isn&#39;t a long period for social change.&amp;nbsp; What about the scouts and how they&#39;ve changed over time in other aspects?&amp;nbsp; The organization was created in a massively predominant Christian culture and while I&#39;m not certain, I wouldn&#39;t be the least bit surprised if there was no thought of including non&#45;whites at the outset.&amp;nbsp; These would have mellowed as the organization spread throughout the world &#45; scouting now exists in over 160 countries &#45; and after the start of the Civil Rights actions of the 1950s and 1960s, packs and troops began to integrate accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the spread of scouting meant that there was a less&#45;Christian emphasis although there is still a distinct acknowledgement of a Supreme Creator; that said, the acknowledgement of God to a scout can vary according to his own personal faith.&amp;nbsp; There are faith&#45;based badges for any number of religious beliefs apart from Christianity, including Judaism, Islam and Buddhist.&amp;nbsp; At the boy scout level, the only acknowledgement&amp;nbsp; of faith is in the scout law in which a scout pledges to be reverent; there are no rank advancement requirements for religious belief and a scout can be agnostic or atheist.&amp;nbsp; My comments to a few kids have amounted to the notion that reverent would ultimately mean respectful of another&#39;s faith even if you don&#39;t practice or believe it.&amp;nbsp;
But the admission of gay scout leaders in this matter is in one respect a different issue from race and creed.&amp;nbsp; Communications and global awareness have helped spread the idea &#45; operative but imperfect &#45; that there is value to other races and creeds, but the United States is one of a small handful of countries that has actively pursued full equality for gays.&amp;nbsp; There is a now an understanding that there are good men of any number of races and creeds, but gay leadership for an organization that ultimately exists to help boys learn and grow into good men begs the simple question, what does it mean to be a man?&amp;nbsp; The question sounds insulting, but it does exist.&amp;nbsp; Women today decry the state of husbands and fathers &#45; men in general &#45; but the social and economic changes of the past several decades have contributed as traditional roles have also changed accordingly and more than a few men have foundered as their role&#45;model templates simply ceased to exist.&amp;nbsp; I can attest that there are single mothers bringing their sons to scouting with the idea that the scout leader can provide a strong, operative role model for their boys to become men.&amp;nbsp; As confused as today&#39;s family situations can be, will a gay leader simply create further confusion for the boys?
Tragic History
The BSA suffered the same damage as the Catholic Church in America as pedophilic leaders surfaced in the organization; the crimes were often not reported and efforts were made to protect the organization at the ultimate expense of the boys.&amp;nbsp; An onslaught of civil litigation against the BSA starting in the 1970s showed that the organization was wholly unprepared to deal with predators who found that it was an exceptionally easy means to gain access to the boys, who could be stalked and groomed for molestation.&amp;nbsp; While it isn&#39;t universal &#45; and not shared by me &#45; there is a fear among some scout supporters that the admission of openly gay leaders would increase the possibility of again permitting access of predators to the boys despite the multiple safeguards that have been instituted since those years.&amp;nbsp;
The concern is accentuated by the opening of the &amp;quot;BSA Perversion Files&amp;quot; in late 2012 as the result of an Oregon Supreme Court decision.&amp;nbsp; The files &#45; showing approximately 1200 instances in which the BSA handled allegations of sexual abuse from the 1960s to 1985 &#45; renewed awareness of the organization&#39;s handling and sensitivity to the issue and in the eyes of some, overshadow the training and safeguards put in place by the BSA.&amp;nbsp; The contents of these files are not solely academic; my local paper ran a series of articles highlighting local instances of pedophilia allegations and one of the men named as an alleged pedophile committed suicide within weeks of the particular article.&amp;nbsp;
BSA Organizational Infrastructure
If change is indeed both right and necessary, then the group most affected by the change has to take great care that it&#39;s done in a manner that the resulting effects aren&#39;t more harmful than the change itself.&amp;nbsp; This idea is best encapsulated in the absurdity of the Vietnam War remark, we had to destroy the village in order to save it.&amp;nbsp; While people talk of the BSA as a monolithic organization at the national level, they&#39;re unaware that the group&#39;s organization is a microcosm of some of the divisions within larger American society.&amp;nbsp; If things aren&#39;t handled properly and with great care, there&#39;s a real risk that the organization will literally gut itself.
The national organization oversees dozens of local/regional councils that exist to support the thousands of cub scout packs and boy scout troops and it&#39;s here that the first inklings of different opinions appear.&amp;nbsp; The councils for central Arkansas or West Texas, for example, comprise regions with people whose general attitude is considerably different from councils covering Boston or New York.&amp;nbsp; It sounds academic, but the strongest councils are mostly in those areas that are politically and socially conservative, whether urban, suburban or rural and it&#39;s in these areas that the heart of scouting is located.&amp;nbsp; But the activist gay communities that most support gay leaders are located in the urban areas that do not have strong concentrations of scouting; there&#39;s considerable risk of strong backlash and damage in the former if the national BSA bows to activist pressure, even with the resumption of funding and the halt of celebrity denunciations.&amp;nbsp;
Part and parcel of this division occurs at the local levels of scouting, immediately beneath the councils.&amp;nbsp; For a pack or troop to be officially chartered by the BSA &#45; meaning that they have access to the scout programs, ranks and awards &#45; it must have a sponsoring chartered organization; the chartered organization agrees to provide meeting space for the group and abide by scouting principles.&amp;nbsp; Many of these organizations provide more just the minimum required and enter into a partnership with the troop so that the local scout leadership also agrees to abide by sponsoring organization policies .&amp;nbsp; In my case, I&#39;ve not only submitted to a criminal background check for the scouts, but also additional criminal checks to meet the sponsoring church&#39;s child/youth safety policy. The simple reality is that the great majority of sponsoring organizations are individual churches, many of which are of denominations that do not recognize homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle for religious reasons.&amp;nbsp; The heart of that particular question is whether homosexuality is hard&#45;wired from birth or a chosen behavior and for that I have no answer.&amp;nbsp; On a personal level again, the scout troops in my hometown are sponsored by two churches, neither of which acknowledges homosexuality as acceptable.&amp;nbsp; If the national organization approves gay leadership, expect a significant number of sponsoring organizations to withdraw their support with the practical effect that hundreds &#45; if not thousands &#45; of local packs and troops would lose their support and be forced to find new homes.&amp;nbsp; With civic groups decimated themselves by dwindling membership, what other churches are out there to take up the slack?&amp;nbsp;
The end result &#45; from a social and religious &#45; level is that the BSA would be self&#45;inflicting serious and potentially fatal wounds upon itself.&amp;nbsp;
The Upshot
Change isn&#39;t easy and frankly, it&#39;s damned hard for anybody.&amp;nbsp; What makes it harder is that ideologues on each side usually take a scorched earth approach so that the collective value of an organization is minimized unless a particular view is adopted, even if the adoption threatens to overturn everything else positive that&#39;s accomplished.&amp;nbsp; How many gay adults really wish to lead and does the larger gay community have the right to financially and politically coerce a private organization to amend core beliefs to accommodate them?&amp;nbsp; For all of the internal damage that could occur from such a switch, what is the larger gay community willing to do to help the BSA?&amp;nbsp; Simply telling the supporters that it&#39;s now okay to turn on the fiscal taps isn&#39;t going to be enough.&amp;nbsp; Will the gay community actively step in to help with the infrastructure &#45; while abiding by core scouting principles &#45; or are they going to plant the flag and declare victory, moving on while the BSA tries to recover from it&#39;s wounds?&amp;nbsp;
Compromise is even more difficult than change.&amp;nbsp; Supporters on either side have to truly examine their beliefs to determine what&#39;s most important, then lay those lesser notions to rest as they take up the work to build for the future.&amp;nbsp; Compromise is frankly possible here, as well.&amp;nbsp; But much will depend on whether the ideologues are willing to lay aside the rhetoric and examine the realities of the situation.
Much of what I write is centered around the family, the economy and society.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a supporter of the scouts and have resolved to remain one after my own son is through the process, as far as he chooses to go, regardless of the decision.&amp;nbsp; What is so immensely frustrating is that many of the central tenets of the scout law &#45; trustworthy, loyal, honest, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent &#45; are what are so sorely needed by an American society beset by moral and ethical failures.&amp;nbsp; Do you trust your senator or representative?&amp;nbsp; Do you believe that the financial system is truly regulated?&amp;nbsp; Are you respectful of the ideas and beliefs of others, even when they&#39;re at odds with your own?&amp;nbsp; Can you live within your means?&amp;nbsp; These aren&#39;t rhetorical questions but lie at the heart of our present national predicament and if there&#39;s ever a time that we needed to prepare leaders with such qualities, it would be now.&amp;nbsp;

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; March 2013 - Potential and Kinetic Inflation</title>
<body>Late winter is the time for the school science fairs and Youngest just continued the family tradition/requirement of participating.&amp;nbsp; What does this have to do with prices and inflation?&amp;nbsp; Simply because his experiment pertained to the conversion of potential to kinetic energy, via the mechanism of a torsion spring on an onager catapult .&amp;nbsp; A torsion spring is simply the twisting of opposite ends of a material in opposite directions so that tension &#45; potential energy &#45; is stored in the material; when the onager&#39;s throwing arm is depressed and released, the resulting launch of an object is the conversion of the potential to the kinetic energy.&amp;nbsp; With the massive increase in the money supply, albeit offset by the diminished velocity of money, the question of inflation is akin to that of the torsion spring.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Reserve has wound a financial torsion spring that has significant potential energy to generate inflation when the appropriate conditions are met.
But the March 2013 PracticalDad Price Index result presently indicates that while some prices have risen, the total cost of the 47 item market basket has actually dropped once again to 107.24 from February&#39;s 107.81 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; Split out the 37 food items to their own index and the Food&#45;only Index rose from February&#39;s 113.24 to 113.59; life is good provided that you don&#39;t have to eat.&amp;nbsp; The spread &#45; an indicator of how food prices are diverging from non&#45;food prices &#45; for the two indices rose to 6.11, the third month in a row in which it rose.&amp;nbsp; The spread is still less than the all&#45;time high of 6.26 reached in December, 2012 (which is when both indices maxed before collapsing in January 2013).

<title>A View From the Ridge, Part 3</title>
<body>This afternoon marks Youngest&#39;s final Blue&#45;Gold Banquet as a cub scout, the one at which he formally leaves because he&#39;s now too old.&amp;nbsp; He has chosen to move on to boy scouts and part of the ceremony will involve him and his four compatriots officially becoming members of different troops and when he crosses that bridge, ten years of cub scouting for the PracticalDad family will be finished.&amp;nbsp; Raising kids is a forest&#45;for&#45;the&#45;trees experience except for the moments when you reach a ridge that permits you to view you to see where you are on the journey, providing a panoramic view of where we&#39;ve been with the kids and where we still need to go.
As the literal and figurative greybeard for this particular pack, I&#39;ve taken on much and have planned the actual ceremony; walking through the ceremony has struck me as to the passage of time.&amp;nbsp; When we began this process, Eldest was in elementary school and herself a girl scout.&amp;nbsp; Middle began scouting in the first grade and Youngest was only a baby in Mom&#39;s arms.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ll see this afternoon is Eldest back from college as a surprise for Youngest, and Middle in the audience as a high school student.&amp;nbsp; Another trail from the road is circling back onto itself, closing the loop and a look back from the ridge reveals any number of looped trails that we&#39;ve encountered and passed.&amp;nbsp; Looking ahead shows more valleys with the road but the road itself is changing as the kids continue to age, grow and even mature into adults.&amp;nbsp;
You don&#39;t realize the passage of time and how things change until you reach those ridgelines when the trees have thinned out for a short period.&amp;nbsp; When you do reach that point, take a few moments to pause and appreciate both what you&#39;ve had as well as what you have.&amp;nbsp;
Then plunge down the hill and back into the forest amidst the trees.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Forest Fires</title>
<body>I was taken aback to read Paul Krugman&#39;s recent column, Kick That Can, over the weekend.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been considerable press and debate over the economic necessity &#45; or not &#45; of austerity and the events taking place in Greece put a very human face upon it.&amp;nbsp; Austerity is now in the pipeline here at home and the debate is on over how much debt is supportable and at what point the plug is pulled on further spending.&amp;nbsp; Krugman&#39;s stance is that the damage of reducing government spending &#45; remember C+I+G+(X&#45;M) &#45; with no other driver available would be too much for the economy.&amp;nbsp; Of course, the bulk of government spending at the moment is directed towards either the sandbox wars or untouchable entitlement spending which add nothing to reinvestment.&amp;nbsp; After reading his column, all that I could think of were forest fires.
The US Forest Service was founded by Teddy Roosevelt as we&#39;d gone  through our lumber resources like a hot knife through butter.&amp;nbsp; Protecting the forests meant protecting it from any threat, including  that of forest fire.&amp;nbsp; Fire killed trees and left areas denuded for years  to come.&amp;nbsp; But through decades of study and experience, the Forest  Service learned that there was actually a place and a purpose for fire;  while it did damage, it also cleared away the undergrowth that clogged  the forest floor and prevented substantive new growth if left  untreated.&amp;nbsp; My family and I have driven through smoke&#45;choked areas, the  roads marked with signs advising that there were controlled fires ahead.&amp;nbsp; Clear away the debris and invasives and set the stage for the real new growth.
This is also the way of capitalism and why capitalism has proven to be  such a good economic model for real growth.&amp;nbsp; Credit is misallocated over  time and even with real growth, there is a considerable amount of  deadwood that builds up.&amp;nbsp; The downturns are occasions when the deadwood  is cleared away and the stage is set again for further growth.&amp;nbsp; In terms  of humanity, the effect is one of job loss and economic pain and those  are the realities that have to be addressed by public assistance  programs and personal preparation.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not an idea that is popular or  pleasant, but it is the reality in which we have to live.&amp;nbsp; Despite our  best public and private efforts, things are messy and there will be  real&#45;life pain.
Some argue that we haven&#39;t had true capitalism for more than a decade and I can ascribe to the idea of bifurcated capitalism, capitalism for the masses who must pay for their financial errors while the Too&#45;Big&#45;To&#45;Fail institutions are protected from their excesses and errors.&amp;nbsp; So much has been spent, so much debt incurred, in preventing any failure that might clear away the undergrowth &#45; and yes, even good wood &#45; that the economic forest is thoroughly dense with should&#45;be dying businesses and kudzu&#45;like predatory practices that siphon off so much real wealth.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s happening now is the opposite of forest fires; it&#39;s the rampant addition of fertilizing liquidity across the financial spectrum in the hope that the good wood will somehow grow fast enough that it will eventually actually overtake the forest again.&amp;nbsp; But this is impossible since the fertilizer not only goes to the invasives as well, but they gain even more by leeching onto the healthy growth and siphoning off of them until they finally succumb.&amp;nbsp; The result is a blighted, tangled mess that produces nothing of value.&amp;nbsp;
Despite the best efforts of Forest Service and Federal Reserve, there will be forest fires.&amp;nbsp; But so many aspects have come together that I fear a true conflagration, an economic burn that will lay waste to the nation&#39;s economy:

    The repeated deficits that ratchet up the national debt to levels that are simply unpayable;
    The failure of the Congress to even pass a rudimentary budget that actually addresses our priorities;
    The willingness of the Federal Reserve to abet this travesty by expanding their balance sheet to handle the newly printed government debt;
    The continuing uncontrolled actions of the Too&#45;Big&#45;To&#45;Fail institutions that further lever themselves to levels of derivatives that make the levels of 2008 pale;
    The unwillingness or inability of the government to regulate these institutions and bring their actions to heel;
    Further, the failure to meaningfully prosecute for the financial crimes &#45; and yes, they are crimes &#45; so that a truly painful punishment is exacted and a lesson is taught;
    The willful compliance of the business networks in propagating a view that all is well and that is out of touch with the reality on Main Street.

Bad news sells but in my worst moments, I have to concede that the next forest fire could rival that which struck the 1920s German Weimar Republic or the 1990s Soviet Union.&amp;nbsp;
While this kind of view is often nay&#45;sayed and derided, the reality is that this concern is permeating our society and especially in how it impacts families and child&#45;rearing.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been an awareness of helicopter parenting and well&#45;deserved criticism of it since it doesn&#39;t augur well for children who must move into adulthood.&amp;nbsp; Sites such as Free Range Kids question whether we&#39;ve become too over&#45;protective and promote a more balanced view of society&#39;s threats.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s an understanding that the economy has shifted tectonically and the conventional wisdom of how to succeed is actually hurting our young people by saddling them with toxic debt.&amp;nbsp; Even before they reach that young&#45;adult level, we&#39;re becoming aware that our teens are financially illiterate, even for surviving in an economic consumption model that&#39;s simply unsupportable moving forward. The upshot is that while nobody in the mainstream is willing to say it, the concerns are circling at the family level.&amp;nbsp;
As parents, our role is to not just to provide food and shelter, but ultimately to raise children who have the resiliency to survive what life throws at them.&amp;nbsp; There will always be forest fires and it&#39;s our jobs to give them the character and tools to manage through them.&amp;nbsp; But our collective failure to press for action only sets the stage for fires that will burn through everything and scar our children for generations.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>CIGXM at the Family Level</title>
<body>So the Keynesian view of macroeconomics is based upon the simple formula of C + I + G + (X &#45; M) and the reality is that the Consumer (C) and the Government (G) are tapped out.&amp;nbsp; The business sector with cash is sitting on the sidelines. We&#39;re watching multiple countries &#45; principally the US and Japan &#45; setting the scuttling charges on their currencies as they sink them in pursuit of devaluation to spur exports; the fact that the system is cluttered with so much debt that nobody is really going to buy makes the policy folks look dumb.&amp;nbsp; How does this macro play effect my family at the micro level?
If there were an abracadabra solution, I&#39;d&amp;nbsp; send you shill messages with the promise of the real information for only $29.95.&amp;nbsp; But there are no magic answers, no way to fully innoculate yourself unless you opt to move to a doomstead in the midst of Montana and buy your kids their own personalized .38 snubnoses.&amp;nbsp; Mommy!&amp;nbsp; Daddy!&amp;nbsp; The Tooth Fairy brought me a shiny new hollowpoint!!&amp;nbsp; When that idea truly circulates at a mass level, then even the doomsteads won&#39;t be safe because we&#39;ll have regressed to the most primal level and it&#39;s the director&#39;s cut of Mad Max at your neighborhood...neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; The solutions are so mundane &#45; like, sooooo not abracadabra &#45; that I&#39;ve pondered for a week whether to even finish this article.
The management of CIGXM at today&#39;s family level is about preparing the kids for that great oxymoron, the constancy of change.&amp;nbsp; People will adapt and change as the fabric of society warps and yaws to the greater movements that occur in the world.&amp;nbsp; In the case of CIGXM, there are three great movements.&amp;nbsp;
The first is that the systemic model of consumption &#45; existing for about three generations now &#45; is exhausted and the efforts to continually stimulate consumption simply and boldly illustrate that we the people have simply become fodder for the greater benefit of a system.&amp;nbsp; We must understand that the majority of policy actions are designed to separate us from our money for the benefit of an economic system whose wealth is predominantly controlled by a very small percentage of the population.&amp;nbsp; If it sounds overtly political, the simple reality is that it is; money and power for certain people are attractors to one another akin to crap and stink.&amp;nbsp; The effective neutering of the regulatory structure via the repeal of Glass&#45;Steagal and the uncontrolled entry of dollars into political coffers has allowed a stench that permeates society and actively affects the health of our younger generations. Understand that the constant ring of buy! buy! support the economy! only serves the true interests of a relatively few.
The second is that in the age of globalization, increases in business spending don&#39;t automatically mean an increase in American jobs.&amp;nbsp; The short&#45;term drive for profits means that the cost of labor has become a more flexible factor in cost control than retooling and reinvestment.&amp;nbsp; As with the consumption model, the unfettered access to political votes that comes from uncontrolled campaign finance means that tax advantages also accrue regardless of where the jobs are located.
The final is that we&#39;re going to be entering a true national dialogue over the real role of government, particularly at the federal level.&amp;nbsp; The Keynesian model of government spending as an economic driver is also exhausted as the federal debt &#45; nominal and real (accounting for the true unfunded liabilities) &#45; has reached the point that the dollar itself is endangered.&amp;nbsp; Issues such as the legalization of marijuana and gun control will beg the question whether the government exists to serve the people as set out by the founding fathers, or whether it exists to serve itself at the expense of the people.&amp;nbsp; What does it mean if the government propounds the view for decades that a substance is inherently harmful and dangerous but alters that view within the course of weeks with an eye to taxation?&amp;nbsp; What does it mean when local police departments are forced to announce that it cannot or will not answer certain crime calls but the people are actively discouraged from owning the means through which they can protect themselves?&amp;nbsp; Further, what does it mean that the federal government simultaneously purchases immense quantities of ammunition for it&#39;s own internal security arm?&amp;nbsp; What is the perceived threat that justifies such prosaic, yet vital, actions?
What this means is that what the family is undergoing isn&#39;t recessionary, but actually regressionary.&amp;nbsp; The discretionary spending patterns of past decades are falling away with each thousand dollars of family income lost.&amp;nbsp; Parents will have to be conscious of how their income is spent, knowing that the kids have to be educated with as little debt as possible, the house paid for and their own elder years covered with little expected help from the future government.&amp;nbsp; There will have to be a greater awareness of the world around them and an explicit examination of their own values as those values are expressed in how the family monies are spent.&amp;nbsp;

<title>CIGXM</title>
<body>If you want to have a sense of what&#39;s going on at the moment with the economy and what the fuss is about with currency wars, it&#39;s helpful to understand the five letters CIGXM.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re aren&#39;t random letters and it isn&#39;t an acronym; these are the five variables for a basic economics formula for the determination of a country&#39;s Gross Domestic Product:&amp;nbsp; C + I + G + (X &#45; M).&amp;nbsp; These aren&#39;t random variables but instead delineate the five core categories of aggregate spending that drive a nation&#39;s economy.&amp;nbsp; The five are:
C = Consumer Spending
I = Investment Spending (aka business investment, what companies spend in order to earn money)
G = Government Spending
X = eXports Earnings
M = iMport Spending
While they&#39;re listed in a particular order, it&#39;s more helpful to think of them in some historical context.&amp;nbsp; Each plays a role but not always in equal portions; each however, has provided an outsized contribution in a period of our history so let&#39;s look at them in order of history so that it makes some sense.&amp;nbsp; Rewritten as development drivers, the equation could be I + (X &#45; M) + G + C.
Remember that for the first 60 or so years of our nation&#39;s history, we were mostly an agrarian nation.&amp;nbsp; The industrial aspect didn&#39;t truly take off until around the 1840s when innovations in manufacturing and transportation gave the first outsized push to the national economy.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d grown beforehand, but it was largely on the back of our agriculture and harvesting of our natural resources until then.&amp;nbsp; But the industrialization began in earnest in the 1840s, especially with the textile industry as mills grew up in river towns across the country, fed by the cheap cotton that now came up in bulk from the south.&amp;nbsp; This was the first stirring of the I &#45; Investment &#45; portion; spending by businesses to domestically produce what was needed by a growing nation.&amp;nbsp; It was one thing to build a transcontinental railroad, but the businesses that built them needed the items to make them run:&amp;nbsp; locomotives, steel, and even the machinery necessary to build them in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Likewise with textiles, guns, and everything else that grew with the young, spreading nation.&amp;nbsp; This I portion drove the economy through the First World War and into the 1920s before it finally collapsed with the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;
The national development was also spurred through this period by an increasing drive to export American products abroad &#45; the X variable.&amp;nbsp; Developing and spanning a nation required vast amounts of basic manufactured goods, such as steel.&amp;nbsp; With the natural resources here, these industries grew dramatically so that we needed less imported machinery as we manufactured more and more of our own necessary materials.&amp;nbsp; By the First World War, we&#39;d developed a huge export driven machine, especially to the British and French&amp;nbsp; as they desperately fought the Germans.&amp;nbsp; We lent money to them in huge amounts and with the end of WWI, we took over as exporter to the world and ran a massive trade surplus (X &#45; M, with X &amp;gt; M).&amp;nbsp; The thrifty Chinese have used the same mercantilist policies as we did during those years, actually lending us the money &#45; via purchasing of US Government debt and subsequent federal deficit spending &#45; to purchase their goods at Walmart.&amp;nbsp; For about the past two decades, we&#39;ve imported far more and run chronic trade deficits (X &#45; M, with X &amp;lt; M).
The economy was mired through the first years of the Great Depression as everything &#45; and I mean everything &#45; literally collapsed.&amp;nbsp; Hoover actually did some basically good things, but was constrained by the notion that the government had to balance the books and if there were no tax revenues then there could be no spending.&amp;nbsp; FDR&#39;s arrival in Washington led to the adoption of deficit spending that was proposed by John Maynard Keynes, who used this very formula as the basis of Keynesian economics.&amp;nbsp; Keynes was literally saying Dude, if C and I are shot and nobody&#39;s got the money for anything, then G is the only gun left in the arsenal, so go for it.&amp;nbsp; In his defense, Keynes didn&#39;t mean that the government should go hogwild like a horny cowboy just paid after a cattle drive up the Chisholm trail; he was clear that when things were back on an even keel, the government should pay off the debt.&amp;nbsp; Shore, Jethro, hit the town but jes&#39; &#39;member that youse gotta set some money aside fore when yer too old to be a&#45;drivin&#39; herd.&amp;nbsp;
Good luck with that.&amp;nbsp; Like PJ O&#39;Rourke once wrote:&amp;nbsp; giving money and power to politicians is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.
The truth is that the government continued spending through the Second World War and actually did try to control itself at the end of the war.&amp;nbsp; The budget had to be balanced and that naturally led to huge slashes in defense spending and the question, if G is no longer the driver to pay for I and the world is literally wrecked, what variable becomes the driver?&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, C &#45; us.&amp;nbsp; There has been a deliberate effort to get the American consumer to part ways with the income in the past three generations and it&#39;s been wildly successful as first credit card and then student debt hit massive levels.&amp;nbsp; As the consumer began to actually max out in the 1990s, the federal government&#39;s spending reached massive levels and it too began running chronic budget deficits but this government spending helped mask the increasingly tapped&#45;out consumer condition. How?&amp;nbsp; Via immense spending with funding courtesy of the Chinese and easy credit courtesy of the Federal Reserve.&amp;nbsp;
Are you seeing where we now are and where this is going?&amp;nbsp; C is now as tapped as G.&amp;nbsp; There is some controversy as some American businesses &#45; I &#45; have significant money parked offshore and aren&#39;t truly using it productively and members in G want to see it come home.&amp;nbsp; But the folks in I &#45; companies like Caterpillar and Apple &#45; are resistant because they simply aren&#39;t stupid.&amp;nbsp; Aw hell, Jethro wants more money but if I let him have it, he&#39;ll jes&#39; spend it a&#45;whorin&#39; and drinkin&#39; up in Abilene...&amp;nbsp; They recognize that things won&#39;t end well and are trying desperately to hang onto the money to tide them over.
So if the domestic C and G are tapped, and I is keeping it locked up away from G because G is a horny drunk.&amp;nbsp; The only driver left is X and the new currency wars of nations actively devaluing their currency are an effort to make their products more affordable to other nations.&amp;nbsp; This is the impetus of Japan as it devalues the currency to keep business flowing to it&#39;s export driven economy.&amp;nbsp; This is also partially our strategy, although the other intent is to pay off the debt with a devalued dollar.&amp;nbsp; More countries will take this approach &#45; Venezuela&#39;s overnight devaluation of 46% is the newest example &#45;and what some term the race to the bottom will continue.&amp;nbsp; But as everybody pursues X, the value of any trade surplus is negated as the respective currencies are destroyed.&amp;nbsp; Everybody&#39;s come to Abilene for one last mind&#45;bending debauch
Any cowboy with a lick of sense knew that an Abilene bender would be followed by a blistering hangover.&amp;nbsp; But the thinking of our present crop of hands in G is this:&amp;nbsp; Hangover?&amp;nbsp; Hell, I caint get no hangover ifen I jes&#39; keep a&#45;drinkin&#39;.&amp;nbsp;
The tagline in the blogosphere is that this isn&#39;t going to end well.&amp;nbsp; And it won&#39;t.&amp;nbsp;

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; February 2013 Declines</title>
<body>The most recent talk in the macro world is now about currency wars as nations devalue their currencies in a race to the bottom with the goal of making their products more attractive to overseas buyers.&amp;nbsp; The offshoot of devalued currencies can be inflation, which is what the central bankers and treasury folks want.&amp;nbsp; But while all of that is in the macro world, what&#39;s happening in the micro world of the grocery shelf in front of you?&amp;nbsp; If the bankers saw the 47 item PracticalDad marketbasket, they&#39;d waste a bit more ink because the February 2013 index fell to 107.81 from January&#39;s 108.01 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; Strip out the non&#45;food items to isolate the 37 food items themselves and they would see a point rise from January&#39;s 113.24 to February&#39;s 113.59 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;only Index is still three quarters of a point below the high of 114.33 reached in December 2012.
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;only Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread

Note that the &amp;quot;spread&amp;quot; between the Total Index and the Food&#45;only Index did rise so that there was greater activity amongst foodstuffs themselves, but again, it&#39;s still almost a half point beneath the apogee reached in December 2012.
I recommend that you spend a few minutes and check out the link above.&amp;nbsp; The short video &#45; produced by a Brit &#45; is a good basic explanation of the currency war concept.

<title>Legalizing Pot:&nbsp; The ATM</title>
<body>Nobody&#39;s gonna look out for you, kid.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; PracticalDad&#39;s Father
My father&#39;s comment to me as a teenager came back to me when I read that there was a move afoot in Congress to tax legalized marijuana after passage of the legalization referendums in Washington and Colorado.&amp;nbsp; After decades of demonization and imprisonment, the federal government is simply going to shift gears and tax it for the revenues.&amp;nbsp; My father&#39;s message was that the system was built to look out for others, and in the 1970s, others meant minorities and women.&amp;nbsp; But the message is still pertinent even if heavily modified.&amp;nbsp; The system now is built to look out for itself and the people &#45; regardless of race, religion or gender &#45; exist to serve this equal&#45;opportunity system.&amp;nbsp; This latest iteration is a message that I&#39;ve passed along to my own kids on several occasions.&amp;nbsp;
This article prompted several things to occur to me as I was otherwise occupied today.

    The article referenced that probable jurisdiction for the regulation of legalized marijuana would reside with the ATF (aka the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) although it could be renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Marijuana and Firearms.&amp;nbsp; If it does reside there, a little honesty &#45; like that&#39;s going to happen &#45; would be refreshing:&amp;nbsp; rename it the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Marijuana, aka The ATM.&amp;nbsp;
    Successful politicians understand the importance of the care and feeding of their constituencies. A significant constituency in the law&#45;and&#45;order world is the private prisons lobby, which contributes millions to politicians; they strongly oppose legalization since a fair minority of the inmates are there for marijuana related offenses.&amp;nbsp; Legalization is a threat to their revenue stream and if the Congress is to successfully feed and care for the prison lobbyists, then something must replace the lost revenue stream.&amp;nbsp; If pot is legalized, what&#39;s criminalized?
    With all of the concern over terrorists &#45; foreign and domestic &#45; and homegrown whackos toting real hardware, then firearms might shift from the ATF to the Department of Homeland Security.&amp;nbsp; DHS has significantly upgraded their weaponry with thousands of real automatic weapons and millions of hollow&#45;point bullets; they sorely need a reason to justify this.&amp;nbsp; Securing and maintaining control of the sheer number of weapons domestically requires the administrative heft of a larger DHS instead of the ATF.&amp;nbsp; If the government can work with the media to sufficiently scare the populace, then having one of the targeted guns could become a truly criminal offense.&amp;nbsp; Wait a minute...&amp;nbsp; Now there&#39;s a win&#45;win scenario.

It&#39;s our responsibility as parents to look out for the well&#45;being of our children.&amp;nbsp; Make sure that you don&#39;t start believing that the government is your ever&#45;dependable ally.

<title>Should Higher Ed Be Left to the Private Sector Instead of the Public Sector?</title>
<body>Higher education is a mess.&amp;nbsp; Disproportionate rising costs,  slashed public education budgets and arguments over what to afford in  the face of out&#45;of&#45;control public spending merge with falling incomes  and inadequate job growth to create huge angst and debate over where we  go from here.&amp;nbsp; The present model appears to be broken.&amp;nbsp; Is it fixable  and if so, how do we fix it?&amp;nbsp; Or do we chuck it completely and simply  adopt another model?&amp;nbsp; With the present distrust of government, perhaps  we should just leave higher education to the private sector?&amp;nbsp;
Youngest and I sat watching The Big Bang Theory the other evening when The University of Phoenix, a for&#45;profit university, ran a commercial.&amp;nbsp; In the ad, a contented looking African&#45;American woman was driving through a homogeneously corporate parking lot in search of a space.&amp;nbsp; As she drove, the voice&#45;over announced that the University of Phoenix was working in conjunction with other major American corporations to provide the skills needed by Americans to earn a good and productive living.&amp;nbsp; The list of corporations was impressive &#45; Microsoft, Avis, Google, McDonalds, Cisco, Adobe &#45; and one that most would associate with the upscale white&#45;collar jobs desired by most.&amp;nbsp; It was a provocative message that resonated to the higher ed themes that concern us most:&amp;nbsp; what jobs are out there to provide for me and a family and how can I make a decent&#45;enough wage to repay the debt that I&#39;m going to incur?&amp;nbsp; This would presumably be what Secretary of Education Arne Duncan referred to as a &amp;quot;...very good debt to have&amp;quot; in April, 2012.
Before we start to entertain the notion that the private sector is the best provider of higher education, let&#39;s consider some statistics thus far:

    In September 2012, the federal Department of Education released results showing that the three year student loan default rates were 13.4%.&amp;nbsp; Bur of this, the default rate for loans to student at for&#45;profit institutions came in at 22%, or more than one&#45;fifth of all loans to students in that sector; the default rate for students in public institutions was about 11%.&amp;nbsp; While there&#39;s no word on this sector breakout, the most recent data is that the overall student default rate has climbed to greater than 15% as of October 2012.
    For&#45;profit institutions have been involved in multiple investigations and settlements for illegal or unethical practices, such as deceptively marketing to veterans to gain access to generous veteran educational benefits.&amp;nbsp; See also here, here, and here.
    The graduation rate of for&#45;profit institutions is only 28%, less than half of that at public universities.

Let&#39;s shift outwards, from the private&#45;sector education system to the private sector in general.&amp;nbsp; The private sector is entirely that &#45; private &#45; and exists to enrich the owners and members of the private sector.&amp;nbsp; The private sector generally consists of any for&#45;profit business and can range from Joe&#39;s Shoe Repair to Exxon.&amp;nbsp; In the case of for&#45;profit universities however, the private sector consists of large corporations, capital holding companies and some exceptionally wealthy individuals.&amp;nbsp; So who owns the for&#45;profits?&amp;nbsp; There are hundreds of actual for&#45;profit institutions, but we&#39;ll look at four for our purposes:&amp;nbsp; University of Phoenix; Kaplan University; DeVry University; and ECPI.

    University of Phoenix is owned by the Apollo Group (NYSE), and the principal shareholder is John Sperling, now a billionaire.&amp;nbsp;
    Kaplan University is a subsidiary of the Washington Post (NYSE), among whose principal shareholders are Aberdeen Asset Management, Berkshire Hathaway and ING Investment Management.
    DeVry University is part of Bell &amp;amp; Howell, a wholly owned company of Versa Capital Management in Philadelphia.
    ECPI is a smaller, regional for&#45;profit operating in the southeast US, principally in the Tidewater region of Virginia and the Carolinas; it is owned by the Dreyfus family and the founder&#39;s son, Mark, is currently the President.

Most of these entities exist to maximize Return on Investment and Equity, nothing more and nothing less.&amp;nbsp; While I can&#39;t speak for the family&#45;owned institution, there&#39;s no effective oversight of the entity that might be provided by a Board of Directors that&#39;s tasked with specific responsibilities and is able to help parse out those instances when profit might compete with the original charges of the founding charter.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, for the great majority of for&#45;profits, there is no other original charge in any founding charter.&amp;nbsp;
If you follow, many of the actionable complaints about the for&#45;profits are in the area of admissions.&amp;nbsp; Fines have been levied and paid by multiple for&#45;profits because of deceptive advertising; pertinent rates &#45; graduation, employment &#45; were falsified and loan programs misrepresented in order to gain enrollees.&amp;nbsp; The intent of the actions has been to gain access to the loans that were easily available via lax standards, and you don&#39;t blow a trillion dollar loan bubble by upholding underwriting standards.&amp;nbsp; There are existent study programs in the for&#45;profits and there are certainly graduates, but the reality is that many marginally qualified students were enrolled without the infrastructure in place to assist them once they were there.&amp;nbsp; But even after the student left, the school was able to keep the money and the responsibility for that money was still left to the student.
Does that also happen at the public sector and non&#45;profit sector?&amp;nbsp; Sure.&amp;nbsp; But the difference is that the institutions in the public and non&#45;profit sectors are subject to a more rigorous accreditation standard than are the for&#45;profits.&amp;nbsp; There are also public and not&#45;for&#45;profit charters that provide some measure of guidance beyond the simple profit motive and Boards that are both composed of a more diverse group of people, as well as being closer to an effective oversight level than the Board of a major corporation that owns a for&#45;profit institution as a division. Given these aspects, the moral hazard promoted by a monetary policy of easy availability and low interest rates is lesser than for that of an entity for whom profit is the principal and overwhelming measure.&amp;nbsp;
There is a niche for institutions that cater to non&#45;traditional students and entities like the University of Phoenix grew out of an effort to fill that niche and do so profitably.&amp;nbsp; Profit by itself isn&#39;t a bad thing, either.&amp;nbsp; But the absence of any effective oversight and more importantly, an exceptionally easy monetary policy that invites moral hazard, led to a morphing of a niche into something that has saddled the nation and its citizens with inexcusable results.&amp;nbsp; The private sector should stick with the niche, but the bulk of the education of our young people should be left with the public and non&#45;profit arenas.

<title>What&#8217;s the Role for Government in Higher Education:&nbsp; Fiscal or Monetary?</title>
<body>The kids know from listening to me &#45; typically in a shoe&#45;propelled rant at the University of Phoenix television commercial &#45; that their enrollment in a for&#45;profit institution is unlikely.&amp;nbsp; We live in a corporate age and this is just another attempt by the corporations to milk us for increasingly scarce dimes.&amp;nbsp; But if there&#39;s strength in numbers and we hold that education truly is critical in this post&#45;manufacturing &amp;quot;knowledge&#45;based&amp;quot; economy, there is a crucial role for the government to be involved.&amp;nbsp; There are three policy legs &#45; tax, fiscal and monetary &#45; and both state and federal governments are involved in the tax policy with tax&#45;advantaged savings programs to help with tuition.&amp;nbsp; But in a time of rapidly increasing tuitions, tax policy is the least important.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the value of a tax savings if you can&#39;t afford the education in the first place?&amp;nbsp; That leaves fiscal and monetary policy, and which is the true place for the government?
For the greater part of our nation&#39;s first century, government had no role in education whatever; any schools formed were solely at the local level to provide the rudiments of reading, writing and arithmetic.&amp;nbsp; Higher education was available via private institutions and was the province of the affluent or the exceptional, who worked assiduously to finance their studies.&amp;nbsp; The federal government&#39;s initial foray came &#45; incredibly enough &#45; during the Civil War when the urgings of an idealist Congressman led to the passage of the Morrill Act of 1862 and the creation of the Land Grant universities.&amp;nbsp; Even here, the national government didn&#39;t provide money, but simply free land &#45; and boy howdy, did we have it then &#45; with the caveat that the subscribing states sell part of the land for seed money for an institution, to be built on a portion of that free land.&amp;nbsp; The congressman&#39;s efforts were the fusion of two elements:&amp;nbsp; one that he believed and another that he understood.&amp;nbsp; The belief was that a person would both prosper and become a more enlightened citizen if they had access to an education that provided the skills and tools to better their circumstances.&amp;nbsp; The understanding was that the nation required a skilled, educated populace for it&#39;s growing and changing needs.&amp;nbsp; One fed the other in a virtuous circle.&amp;nbsp;
The Morrill Act also laid out the premise that meeting the educational needs of the population were best left at the state level; different regional needs could be best managed at the lower level, which had greater familiarity with its needs and circumstances.&amp;nbsp; So apart from creating a framework within which the states could establish their systems &#45; building the sandbox &#45; the federal government stepped aside and left the growing fiscal needs of higher education to the various states.&amp;nbsp; It was throughout the growing industrialization and prosperity of the next century that the states, with the footing provided by the Morrill Act, created an infrastructure of institutions to provide an reasonably affordable higher education to the young.&amp;nbsp; The apogee of this educational availability occurred in the years after the Second World War, when the nation entered an era of affluence that had never before been seen in history.
But this availability was funded directly &#45; via fiscal spending &#45; by the states.&amp;nbsp; Times were flush and the resources existed to fund higher education, and the states put up the funding to make education affordable for the masses.&amp;nbsp; Labs were funded, buildings built and faculty salaries paid by purposeful state funding.&amp;nbsp; But the world changes before we&#39;re aware of it and as funding continued, additional demands were made upon resources by others and state funding for social needs rose.&amp;nbsp; The states also felt the impact of the &amp;quot;Reagan Revolution&#39;s&amp;quot; mantra that government isn&#39;t the solution, it&#39;s the problem.&amp;nbsp; Spending was questioned and the line items that could actually be managed were slowly pared away; but spending on social needs programs continued and the emphasis in state government spending went from preparation to caretaking.&amp;nbsp; By the first decade of the 21st century, per capital spending by state governments &#45; the fiscal policy &#45; was in decline.&amp;nbsp; State colleges and universities were seeing that the average family incomes of their students was rising; it&#39;s counter&#45;intuitive since you&#39;d think that was a good thing.&amp;nbsp; But what it means is that the students from the higher income families themselves were being squeezed out of the private and into the public institutions, while the students from the lowest income families were squeezed out of the public institutions entirely.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s now where we&#39;re at, with purposeful fiscal spending in decline by the states.
While there was an apogee and subsequent decline in fiscal spending and policy for higher education, there was also movement in the monetary policy towards higher education.&amp;nbsp; While fiscal policy pertains to actual spending &#45; putting your money where your mouth is &#45; monetary policy is about simply making the money available, in volume and at low cost.&amp;nbsp; The crunch and upwards in student debt occurred in the first decade of the century, propelled by twin engines.&amp;nbsp; The first engine was the real need for borrowed money as the tuition finally outpaced the ability of the average family&#39;s falling incomes, forcing many families and students to truly borrow large sums.&amp;nbsp; The other engine was the glut of easy money made available as the Federal Reserve truly opened up the money supply after the dotcom and housing bubble collapses.&amp;nbsp; Families were now forced to let the students take on the debt themselves as their own circumstances worsened, and the Fed&#39;s easy money policy made it available in spades.&amp;nbsp; As states scaled back their per&#45;capital student spending and costs rose, the federal government stepped in with easy money.
Here&#39;s the thing about monetary policy and higher education however:&amp;nbsp; it&#39;s a chicken&#45;or&#45;the&#45;egg proposition.&amp;nbsp; Escalating tuition and decreasing government support made an easy monetary policy seem beneficial since abundant money made the college education work.&amp;nbsp; Yet part of the tuition problem was due to the existence of an easy money policy.&amp;nbsp; On one hand, institutions had no impetus to control their spending since the money was available, even if it was funneled through the students from the lenders.&amp;nbsp; As competition raged amongst the institutions, they began to market the experience as well as the education and money was frankly spent on sheer frivolities; if your college markets a climbing wall and Mongolian grill, then it&#39;s frivolous.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, the easy money availability led to predatory recruitment practices by for&#45;profit institutions; the present default rate at for&#45;profit institutions is double that at public and triple that at non&#45;profit institutions.&amp;nbsp; The money created an impetus to defraud the students.
There is a distinct difference between the effects of fiscal and monetary policy on higher education.&amp;nbsp; But the effect of easy monetary policy is largely the same in higher ed as in the other arenas:&amp;nbsp; it breeds laziness and radically increases the prospect of moral hazard.&amp;nbsp; The laziness is on the part of the public, who simply look at the low cost loans and the advertising and don&#39;t consider other aspects until it&#39;s too late; the institutions are equally lazy as the stream of funding lulls them into thinking that choices don&#39;t have to be made and decisions can be deferred.&amp;nbsp; The stream of funding propels the amoral into acts of immorality as the rewards far outweigh the cost of the penalty.&amp;nbsp; If you doubt this, ask yourself whether the penalties meted out to institutions even meet &#45; let alone exceed &#45; the profits garnered.&amp;nbsp;
Fiscal policy however, literally means that you&#39;re putting the money where your mouth is.&amp;nbsp; It means that there&#39;s an actual debate &#45; contentious, perhaps &#45; about not only how society perceives the value of higher education but also how funding is apportioned to support that value.&amp;nbsp; If the nation truly believes that education matters for the good of the person and the nation, then funding should be allocated to support it accordingly.&amp;nbsp; As the phrase goes, money talks and bullshit walks.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve now boxed ourselves in.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve confused money with the real and productive assets that support the debt that&#39;s been incurred.&amp;nbsp; The costs of an education have far outstripped the debt&#45;servicing ability of the average American family&#39;s declining income, yet we&#39;ve restructured ourselves as both a service and knowledge&#45;based economy that notionally requires a college degree for any real financial success.&amp;nbsp; Student debt is now a bubble and the smell of the easy money has led to poor personal decisions and corrupt business decisions that taint monetary policy.&amp;nbsp; Even if tuition at an increasing number of institutions is cut, the college cost/family income ratio is so disproportionate &#45; and the job market so bleak &#45; that it would take decades for any proportionality to be restored.&amp;nbsp; If we truly value education at both the personal and national level, then there&#39;s no other choice but to provide fiscal policy support to the public institutions.&amp;nbsp; The eras of easy money and unfettered prosperity are over.&amp;nbsp; Dead.&amp;nbsp; Gone.&amp;nbsp; There is a time coming, and soon, when we&#39;ll have to make conscious choices first about what we truly value and then about how we&#39;ll allocate the remaining resources amongst those values. Our mettle is going to be tested and it will be truly unpleasant.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s a bright side, it&#39;s the realization that the value question isn&#39;t new ground but has already been addressed.&amp;nbsp; At least we don&#39;t have to revisit in the midst of a civil war.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Memento</title>
<body>Most movie fans know Christopher Nolan as the renovator and director of the recent Batman movie trilogy.&amp;nbsp; But many may not be aware that one of his early films, Memento, is considered by some critics to be one of the best suspense films of the century&#39;s first decade.&amp;nbsp; In the film, the protagonist is searching for the killer of his wife, yet suffers from a form of amnesia in which he&#39;s incapable of maintaining short&#45;term memories.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s notable about the film is that he works through the problem with the aid of polaroid photos, which he posts to a board and then strings together in an effort to create linkages that make sense to him, a sense of context.&amp;nbsp; This metaphor stays with me because as a parent &#45; whose principal job is to raise the children to take their place in the great, wide world &#45; I&#39;m helping the kids string together their mass of experiences and memories into a recognizable form that gives rich context to the world in which they live.
Ask kids who are home from school what they did that day and you&#39;re liable to get an i dunno or perhaps one or two snippets of something.&amp;nbsp; Many won&#39;t take the time to process unless they&#39;re prompted to do so and those experiences will most likely remain isolated photos on the memory board unless something happens &#45; by chance or purpose &#45; to pull them together.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t about speaking to them as soon as they walk in the door or you pick them up, but it&#39;s about making the time and effort to talk with them, to draw them out and learn the experiences so that any conversation can lead to the possibility of making the connections.&amp;nbsp; The conversation can lead to any number of potential topics:&amp;nbsp; how do you complain to the bus driver &#45; or any adult &#45; if you feel you&#39;re being unfairly singled out (without sounding like you&#39;re whining?); what is the point of reading &amp;quot;The Great Gatsby&amp;quot;, or any older novel?; why can&#39;t you punch a girl back, and what does it mean if she&#39;s smacking you in the arm?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Conversation might not flow the way that you&#39;d like, and it sometimes doesn&#39;t even flow at all.&amp;nbsp; Well...how &#39;bout those Mets?&amp;nbsp; The unfortunate reality however, is that there is an ongoing conversation with your kids and it&#39;s coming from the entertainment/media complex.&amp;nbsp; For decades now, the complex has offered up examples with lousy messages, going back to Fast Times at Ridgemont High&#39;s Spiccoli, through Beavis and Butthead, South Park&#39;s Cartman and all of the gangsta culture thrown about via multiple media.&amp;nbsp; Violence is endemic, women are demeaned &#45; it might not matter now, but it will when you have a daughter &#45; and poor behaviors such as drinking, drugs and gratuitous sex are celebrated.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not Amish and our kids have access to the electronic media, but the point is that unless you&#39;re willing to fully disconnect their media access, you have to be prepared to engage them whenever possible so that they begin to make the connections that you know truly need to be made.
Helping them make these connections, helping them build a coherent framework through which to interpret the world and interact with it, is not a one&#45;off process.&amp;nbsp; This is a life&#45;long endeavor and commences from the day of their birth; if we handle it properly, it will continue until the day of our death.&amp;nbsp; But the connections that are made will take these seemingly isolated instances and not only link them, but transform them from a two&#45;dimensional board into a three&#45;dimensional structure that helps them navigate their own lives and sustains them in those truly dark places that can exist in adulthood.&amp;nbsp; This is our purpose as parents, to raise them to make their way.&amp;nbsp; Leaving the conversations to the media complex is ultimately as harmful as starving them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
They do want to eat.&amp;nbsp; And while they can&#39;t or don&#39;t always want to show it, they do want your attention and conversation.

<title>Teaching Kids About Money</title>
<body>There was an article in MSN Money over the Christmas holiday &#45; Why Teens Fail at Managing Money &#45; with the premise that teens are ill&#45;prepared to survive in the modern financial world.&amp;nbsp; Several individuals quoted in the article believe that all high schools should be mandated to teach a personal finance course; thirteen states presently require that high schoolers receive such a course.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s significant blowback from educators who cite the cost involved and also the simple fact that they believe themselves ill&#45;prepared to adequately teach the material.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;truth is that&amp;nbsp;personal finance isn&#39;t just&amp;nbsp;a series of techniques about cash&amp;nbsp;flow management and financing calculations; how someone handles money is&amp;nbsp;ultimately a function&amp;nbsp;of not only what they know about money, but&amp;nbsp;their values.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Values&amp;nbsp;aren&#39;t derived from discrete lessons at specific points&amp;nbsp;in time, but from immersion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The academic view is that&amp;nbsp;money serves both as a&amp;nbsp;medium of exchange &#45; thereby eliminating the need for barter &#45; and a store of value.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In a sense though,&amp;nbsp;how we use money is a store of our&amp;nbsp;values and that comes from immersion within the family.
Both money and debt are tools, as much in their way as a screwdriver or hammer.&amp;nbsp; But if you give a child a hammer or screwdriver, you see that things don&#39;t go the way that the kid expects.&amp;nbsp; Nails are bent to hell and back and learning how to drive a nail straight requires a degree of practice that only comes with time.&amp;nbsp; Kids also tire of the repetitive nature of constantly turning a screwdriver and after some turns, will usually look at you with an okay, can you finish this and we&#39;ll move onwards expression.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that any skill, let alone mastery, will only come with time.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a bit absurd to think that giving a kid a course in personal finance in high school will provide them with the requisite skills to successfully manage their finances.&amp;nbsp; Knowing how to budget is only a fraction of the battle if the discipline to maintain it isn&#39;t there, and the constant effort to blur need and want makes it problematic.&amp;nbsp; One of my taglines when I hear the kids mention wanting something is yep...need, want.&amp;nbsp; That ability to discriminate can only come with constant reminders and conversation and those won&#39;t come in schools.
It&#39;s also important to know when to use the specific tools and that comes with experience as well.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a telling quote from a father within the article, telling in that it gives a glimpse of present attitudes about spending and debt.&amp;nbsp; The father comments that his teen wouldn&#39;t know about how to finance the purchase of a computer.&amp;nbsp; My first thought was to wonder why he wasn&#39;t sitting down with the kid to examine how to finance a computer purchase.&amp;nbsp; But the next thought was to wonder why a computer would have to be purchased with credit anyways.&amp;nbsp; Kids are deeply susceptible to the advertising&#45;sown want/need confusion, and what a kid actually needs in a computer might be very different from what&#39;s really wanted; that confusion can amount to hundreds of dollars.&amp;nbsp; Help the kid work out what&#39;s truly best and then explain the cost differential between using money that&#39;s been saved and money that&#39;s borrowed.&amp;nbsp; Then put that difference in terms of opportunity cost of the next alternative, such as dinner and a movie with friends.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the device has to be purchased now, in which case financing might have to be an option.&amp;nbsp; But if the kid can wait, then it might make more sense to wait and save the money instead.&amp;nbsp; The unasked question is whether the father could wait for such a purchase.
Truly learning something and taking it to heart occurs over time, with lessons and comments delivered persistently and consistently.&amp;nbsp; Once you&#39;ve gone over something several times &#45; and going over it doesn&#39;t mean that it has to be an hour long talk &#45; then develop simple taglines that you can use when the situation comes up again.&amp;nbsp; If I&#39;m paying a repair bill with cash or check, I&#39;ll comment ...and this is why we save.&amp;nbsp; If the kid is yakking on about buying something, I&#39;ll simply glance and say yep...want, need.&amp;nbsp; When we were saving for a trip to Europe, a process that lasted about two years, any of the kids would come up with the suggestion to buy something or do something that required money and my response would be a curt Europe.&amp;nbsp; There reached a point at which one of the kids started speaking and then cut herself off, saying oh yeah, Europe.&amp;nbsp; The tagline with which I was raised was my mother&#39;s we gotta pay the mortgage.&amp;nbsp; It didn&#39;t go into the specifics of which mortgage product is best or how to calculate what we could afford, but it constantly reinforced the lesson of putting the need ahead of the want.&amp;nbsp;
The article is correct in the view that many parents do a poor job of teaching about money because we ourselves are poor with money.&amp;nbsp; Since the end of the Second World War &#45; three full generations &#45; the push has been for consumer spending to drive the economy.&amp;nbsp; This consumption approach is spurred by sophisticated and persistent advertising, and many of today&#39;s parents and grandparents have been fully caught up in it, rendering us both poor examples and teachers for the kids. The impact has been such that many baby&#45;boomers are unable to retire because they simply haven&#39;t saved and the knock&#45;on effect is that the young adults are now having to compete with the boomers for jobs.&amp;nbsp; (Hmmm, there&#39;s a question, what do we owe our elders?)&amp;nbsp; If we want our own kids to avoid that same trap, then we&#39;re obligated to do a better job of financial management so that they can learn from us.
Apart from the issue of financing a purchase instead of saving for it, there are two other aspects that highlight how truly out of touch today&#39;s financial management principles are with reality.&amp;nbsp; The first was a teen&#39;s comment that his family did discuss the stock market at the dinner table and how it was doing; my own conversations with the kids are about how the stock market is the last place that a simple individual investor like me should be.&amp;nbsp; The market is presently a rigged casino.&amp;nbsp; High Frequency Trading with programmable algorithms make crooked practices like front&#45;running and quote&#45;stuffing make classic investing impossible; likewise the presence of overwhelming liquidity courtesy of the Federal Reserve via the major financial institutions proprietary trading desks utterly divorces the market from the reality of economic life around us.&amp;nbsp; When I know families in middle&#45;class Brady Bunch neighborhoods raising chickens for food, the market is simply not realistic.&amp;nbsp; The second is one contributors comments about the value of learning the principle and value of compound interest saving.&amp;nbsp; In a world in which the savings account rate for kids is .1% and a good CD might be in the area of 1.5%, there&#39;s no effective value at all in compounding.&amp;nbsp; The words promote savings but the actions promote spending at the punishment of savers.&amp;nbsp;
Children can learn with lesson plans, but what sticks best are the small repeated doses of a consistent set of messages, the so&#45;called teachable moments.&amp;nbsp; Determine what you want to teach and use pay attention to what&#39;s going on around you and those moments will present themselves.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s a moment that you can have a short conversation, grab it.&amp;nbsp; If not, make it a point to revisit it when the opportunity to talk does present itself.&amp;nbsp; These repeated lessons over the course of time will do far more to teach the kids about money and personal finance than they&#39;ll ever get in a classroom.</body>

<title>Traveling with Aging Kids</title>
<body>It used to all be on the mothers, but even involved fathers are now used to all of the work &#45; preparatory and otherwise &#45; that comes with traveling with kids.&amp;nbsp; What isn&#39;t always obvious is how things change as the kids age and the awareness can creep up on you, smacking you in the head with the figurative lead pipe.&amp;nbsp; This was the occurrence on a recent Christmas holiday trip to Washington, DC.
Some things are the same and I&#39;ve adapted them over the years.&amp;nbsp; First is the purely preparatory logistical work that the little kids will never notice and about which they&#39;ll absolutely never care.&amp;nbsp; But as the kids grow over the years, the preparations are adapted by first involving them &#45; flush all of the toilets and lock all of the windows, empty all of the trash and get it to the garbage cans, find the cats before short trips so that they&#39;re not locked in a room for three days &#45; and then asking to be responsible for certain jobs.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t relieve me of the responsibility to oversee their own tasks, but it does make things easier.&amp;nbsp; By the afternoon of our departure over the holiday, I made it a point to stand there amidst the kids and orally recite the list of items.&amp;nbsp; It didn&#39;t mean that they&#39;d automatically remember it, but it was one of those osmotic processes that the kids should take in through repetition over the years.&amp;nbsp; Mail stopped.&amp;nbsp; Windows locked.&amp;nbsp; Dog kenneled and cats accounted for.&amp;nbsp; Trash emptied...and so on.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a process that helps me and hopefully teaches the kids that these good things only come with preparation.
Second is the status of the family vehicle.&amp;nbsp; Are the tires alright and headlights okay, or are we driving a padiddle? It&#39;s not something that I generally do with the kids, but the obvious one is whether the gas tank is full.&amp;nbsp; The working definition of stupid in my wife&#39;s family is to run out of gas, especially because there&#39;s a gauge to tell you the status.&amp;nbsp; The kids are involved in cleaning out the vehicle of old debris and stuff so that it&#39;s neat, clean and ready for a fully new load of debris and stuff.&amp;nbsp;
Whether traveling overseas or not, safety issues matter although the presence of cell phones makes things easier.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the rally point in the event that everybody&#39;s separated?&amp;nbsp; Have the kids without &#45; and even with &#45; cellphones learned the phone numbers by heart?&amp;nbsp; Do they remember the name of where we&#39;re staying and the area in which it&#39;s located?&amp;nbsp; It matters if you&#39;re staying at a hotel chain and there are multiple hotels in the area.&amp;nbsp; Are you wearing something that&#39;s easily identifiable to them, such as a colored cap?&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll willingly wear identically colored clothing when younger but you&#39;re liable to catch some blowback as they age and balk at bilious pink sweatshirts carrying the family reunion announcement.&amp;nbsp;
What did bother me was that we had to negotiate wake&#45;up times with the teens, whose body clocks are apparently set to Manila time.&amp;nbsp; We could certainly say that we&#39;d be moving at a particular early time &#45; say 9 AM for them &#45; but the reality is that it&#39;s difficult for kids and teens to simply shift their bedtime and rising routines without some consequence; our response is to simply accept that we&#39;ll be moving a little later than the earlybirds.&amp;nbsp; Other parents are free to disagree accordingly.&amp;nbsp; What wasn&#39;t negotiable however, was that once they were moving, they weren&#39;t to spend their time tethered to Facebook or the cellphone; if they just want to dither electronically, they can do it at home for free.&amp;nbsp; The additional factor was that Youngest is still years away from the teen years and still arises earlier.&amp;nbsp; He consequently got to stroll downtown DC with me and see things that his slumbering siblings missed, such as the construction of Presidential Inaugural Viewing Stand and the National Christmas Tree, albeit in the early morning.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s an explicit understanding in our household that traveling means that you&#39;re going to not only see the local sites, but also eat the local food.&amp;nbsp; It seems odd, but America is now so culturally homogenous that many kids think of vacation as an opportunity to eat at Applebees or go to the resident mall to shop and these prospects are everywhere.&amp;nbsp; My job in preparing for the trip was to handle the itinerary &#45; my wife handled the accomodations &#45; in such a way that everybody got something of value.&amp;nbsp; The planning was open with the kids and the thought process involved was open as well.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s Christmas in DC and while we&#39;re staying in a hotel, the Smithsonian is a superb range of museums and it&#39;s free, so like it.&amp;nbsp; If you want to go the National Zoo, what&#39;s the weather forecast and on what day does that make sense? &amp;nbsp;What food is endemic to the DC vicinity?&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly, I opted for Thai on one evening and the next was a visit to Ben&#39;s Chili Bowl.&amp;nbsp; Part of the thought process was to also have some conversation with them about history and culture, and how something as simple as a restaurant could reflect the personality of an area.&amp;nbsp;
Change happens and I like it, it keeps me fresh.&amp;nbsp; But change is best when some thought is given to it in advance so that it can be managed.&amp;nbsp; Things will always go wrong, but you&#39;re not as likely to have a tripbuster if you think things through first, and that&#39;s the big lesson for the kids as they age.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>The Pinewood Derby&#8230;Again</title>
<body>That time of year is here again, the mid&#45;winter companion of NFL playoff games and college hoops and the bane of fathers everywhere, the Pinewood Derby.&amp;nbsp; The time when fathers with a clue have to fight to not overtake the project &#45; or not so much &#45; and fathers without a clue roll their eyes and prepare for a long, l&#45;o&#45;o&#45;o&#45;n&#45;g weekend.&amp;nbsp;  But this year&#39;s different since it&#39;s Youngest&#39;s last Pinewood and it will be the last of ten consecutive years for which the PracticalDad household has had an entry.&amp;nbsp;  It&#39;s also the last for me since I&#39;ve been overseeing the efforts of multiple fathers to set up the track &#45; replete with laser&#45;tripped starter and finish lines and dedicated PC with racing software.
The same question exists this year as before, whether Youngest can win the prize for slowest car and it simply reinforces the surreality of the situation:  has he won if he loses or will he fail if he wins?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fortunate though, in that he&#39;s not thinking now in terms of sheer losing but producing a car that reflects his slightly goofy sense of humor.&amp;nbsp; With luck, there&#39;ll be a universe of two different trophies that he can win, Most Fuel Efficient or Funniest Car. &amp;nbsp;
So the next week is going to be consumed with preparations for the race day &#45; assuring that the software works and that the equipment is up to snuff, that the process is in place for the weigh&#45;in of the cars and that we have enough volunteers in place to manage the process, and that the trophies are completed in a timely and good&#45;looking fashion.&amp;nbsp; The food will be left up to someone else entirely.&amp;nbsp; But the hardest work will be with Youngest, helping him through the process of creating a decent car without actually taking over the hands&#45;on aspects themselves and that will be more mental, ascertaining in advance what questions have to be asked that can lead him to decisions on how to proceed.&amp;nbsp;
Some months ago, I chatted with a mother at the store; this woman had also spent ten years as a cub scout leader for her two sons.&amp;nbsp; I asked whether she missed it, the meeting preparations and all of the background work that came with being a volunteer for a kid&#39;s organization.&amp;nbsp; She responded that yes, I actually do miss it.&amp;nbsp; In the aftermath, you forget the headaches and time spent, the misbehavior and the sheer lunacy that can result from children gathering together for events.&amp;nbsp; When the next weekend&#39;s Derby is finished, I suppose that I&#39;ll also miss it and everything that it entails.
But not quite yet.</body>

<title>Kids and the Corporate World</title>
<body>Years ago, I taught Sunday School in suburban DC and was fascinated by the conversations with the then&#45;teens, kids who are now in their early 30s and possibly with children of their own.&amp;nbsp; The one conversation that sticks with me pertains to fashion and choice of clothing brand; two teens were slamming someone viciously &#45; in absentia, naturally &#45; and when I asked why she so upset them, the first response was that she was a Hollister kid.&amp;nbsp; They saw my confusion and patiently explained, to the retarded adult, that they simply didn&#39;t like anybody who was Hollister and that they spent all of their own time with Polo kids.&amp;nbsp; It was a slap&#45;in&#45;the&#45;face event that drove home how badly we&#39;d become branded.&amp;nbsp; But does there reach a point at which the kids revolt at the branding and begin to draw their own conclusions on the values that come with branding?
I grew up in a corporate household with corporate values and my last paying gig before opting to stay with the kids was in a corporate headquarters.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m no fan of corporations and their exponentially greater political and economic power and one of my great concerns with the kids is how they&#39;ll manage to maintain their individuality and integrity in a corporatist society.&amp;nbsp; So I was taken aback when Youngest, the elementary school kid, came home from school and began bemoaning that Disney was thinking of buying DC Comics.&amp;nbsp; He knew of Stan Lee&#39;s legacy and that he&#39;d already sold Marvel Comics to Disney, likewise with George Lucas&#39; Lucasfilm sale to the Mouse.&amp;nbsp; That particular news item truly brought a surreal conversation about populating the Star Wars stories with Disney characters. This proposed sale was news to me and as we talked, I asked what it was that bothered him the most.&amp;nbsp; Youngest explained that he was afraid that Disney would dumb down the story lines and characters; and being a boy, he was bothered that the level of violence in the story lines would decrease.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re all concerned today about the propensity of violence but the simple fact is that the typical boy has a natural affinity for agression and making things go boom and comic books are an old&#45;fashioned way of honoring that.
What Youngest was saying, in an elementary level fashion, was his concern that yet another corporate takeover would again take something away from our culture &#45; yes, comic books can be considered cultural &#45; in the quest for profit and earnings per share.&amp;nbsp; Marvel and Lucasfilm are now iconic, but they each sprouted from the fertile imaginations of Lee and Lucas and did so in humble environments.&amp;nbsp; When everything is controlled by the corporations &#45; financial and otherwise &#45; then we&#39;ve lost something of ourselves and our national character.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re already at a point where strip shopping centers, office complexes and malls litter enough of the countryside that regional architectural differences are being lost; Topeka is some ways is no different from Savannah, which is no different from Bangor.&amp;nbsp; Couple that with the fact that much of the investing capital is controlled by a small cadre of financial types and we&#39;re at risk for not just cultural homogeneity, but also cultural and technological stagnation.&amp;nbsp; Could George Lucas get the backing necessary for his idea?&amp;nbsp; Could Stan Lee manage to obtain the capital to start Marvel today?&amp;nbsp; At least not without having to give up the special something that made these things so distinctive?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s telling that an elementary school kid could at least sense the blandness of a corporate world, controlled by a small cadre of individuals who decide what has merit and how the advertising dollars go to support the brands that they deem of value.
Life is ironic.&amp;nbsp; At the time of this long&#45;ago Hollister kid conversation, my wife was pregnant with Eldest, our first&#45;born child.&amp;nbsp; Eldest&#39;s first job in high school was at Hollister and she worked there through this past Christmas season.&amp;nbsp; Corporate policy dictated that all employees wear brand apparel for their shifts and I understand that.&amp;nbsp; But I take comfort in the fact that when she has a preference for shopping, it&#39;s at Goodwill.&amp;nbsp; Maybe Eldest also understands what Youngest understands as well.</body>

<title>Young People and Harder Choices</title>
<body>Our kids are now facing a new world that&#39;s different from the one in which they were raised, having been sheltered from reality by parents who in many cases took on debt to maintain a lifestyle that they could no longer afford.&amp;nbsp; The &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; changes in the tax code &#45; the increase in the social security payroll deduction being only the first &#45; are leading to yet another decline in take&#45;home pay and are eye&#45;opening for recent college graduates.&amp;nbsp; A 21 year&#45;old woman was correct in her assessment that this would lead to longer term effects harmful to the economy, such as retarding the growth of new households for the future.&amp;nbsp; But these are only the earliest and easiest of the choices that they will face.&amp;nbsp;
The simple reality which we face is that there are too many fiscal promises piled upon too small a base of productive assets to adequately cover them.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re looking at years of federal deficits in excess of a trillion dollars annually as the government becomes the pump which pushes money through the economy via defense spending, Social Security and Social Security Disability Income benefits, the SNAP program.&amp;nbsp; The young college graduate mentioned in the article states that the money now leaving her paycheck to the government via the increased payroll tax will mean less for entertainment.&amp;nbsp; But the cascade of spending and the coming increase in taxes &#45; because meaningfully cutting spending will alienate a good portion of the almost half of the citizenry receiving some government benefit &#45; will mean that more than entertainment is going to go away.&amp;nbsp; The youngsters of Southern Europe &#45; Spain, Greece, Italy &#45; are seeing their prospects disappear and if this country can&#39;t get a handle on the spending, then our young adults will follow in their track in several years.
Because the difference between the United States and Southern Europe is no more than a few years.</body>

<title>The Trillion Dollar Scumbaggery</title>
<body>If you want to strip all of the speciousness away from an issue and understand it&#39;s true meaning, try to explain it to a teenager.&amp;nbsp; When they get it, they typically ignore the niceties and go directly to the meat, often with refreshing candor.&amp;nbsp; So it was that after Middle and a buddy came in from school, I posed them a question in order to see what they&#39;d both understand and say, specifically about the Trillion Dollar Coin.
As we stood in the kitchen, I told Middle that I had some outstanding debts and couldn&#39;t pay him his overdue allowance but I could give him a Toonie &#45; a Canadian two dollar coin &#45; that I&#39;d had sitting in my jewelry box.&amp;nbsp; Middle and his buddy stood there looking first at me and then at the Toonie sitting on the island, then back at me as if I&#39;d lost my mind.&amp;nbsp; To him, this was simply a Toonie, worth about $2.02 at present exchange and nothing I said otherwise made a difference.&amp;nbsp; He pressed my seriousness again and I dropped the charade; I explained the concept of the Trillion Dollar Coin and its proposed use to circumvent the newly breached debt ceiling and then asked them what they thought.
That is such scumbaggery was his single comment.
When I pressed the two of them as to their thoughts on the issue, they came up with the following.&amp;nbsp;

    First, nobody in their right mind in our town would accept a Toonie, and especially if it they represented it at the convenience store for an arbitrary value that I&#39;d assigned to it.&amp;nbsp; If they wanted to buy Red Bulls, three bags of Doritos and a gallon of ice cream, the clerk would never accept something that I&#39;d given to them with an arbitrary value attached.&amp;nbsp; Assuming that the guy even took the Toonie, it was still only worth $2.02 American dollars and not the value of the overdue allowance.&amp;nbsp;
    Second, nobody in their right mind in the real world will see this as anything other than complete nonsense.&amp;nbsp; The debt will still be incurred and the interest will still have to be paid in the real world.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Reserve might go along with the fiction, but the other buyers of government debt still look at such issues as the ability to carry the interest payments and the solvency of the issuer.&amp;nbsp; D&#39;ya think that the Chinese are gonna go along for this?

Let&#39;s consider the boys&#39; first comment.&amp;nbsp; A quarter is a quarter because there&#39;s common acceptance that it&#39;s worth that amount.&amp;nbsp; The US government says that the quarter is worth 25 cents and the market accepts that; the quarter will purchase 25 cents worth of a good or service, no more and no less.&amp;nbsp; But when the market no longer believes that a good or service is worth 25 cents, then the market demands another value &#45; usually higher.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t mean that the quarter is worth less than 25 cents, but that it will purchase less than what it purchased before.&amp;nbsp; Said another way, the cost of the good/service has increased because the quarter will purchase less than it did.&amp;nbsp; A candy bar once sold for a quarter &#45; and a guy with a kid in elementary school can remember those days &#45; but today, it sells for more than four quarters; the quarter is still worth 25 cents, but the market has decided that all things considered, the item now takes four times the money as before.&amp;nbsp; The convenience store clerk might not accept my claim that a Toonie is worth all of the junk food bought by the boys since I&#39;m just me and don&#39;t have access to intercontinental missiles, carrier battle groups and all of the hookers and blow that Congressional privilege can obtain.&amp;nbsp; In the micro world of the local convenience store, the market has decided that I&#39;m just full of crap.&amp;nbsp; There can also come a point where the market &#45; the many members of the world economy &#45; decides that the US government is likewise full of crap for arbitrarily assigning a large value to a single coin as an accounting dodge.
Now for the boys&#39; second comment.&amp;nbsp; They themselves realize that this is solely an accounting gimmick and that the Federal Reserve is a willing accomplice to our collective failure to stem spending.&amp;nbsp; But the rest of the world, for whom wealth is a bit more precious and hard&#45;earned, isn&#39;t going to look googly&#45;eyed at our grand achievement.&amp;nbsp; They will continue to assess the nation&#39;s ability to service and stand good for the debt and will act accordingly and if they see that our national accounting standards have devolved to the level of I still have checks so I can&#39;t be out of money, then they&#39;ll simply leave our debt issuance alone entirely.&amp;nbsp;: The result would be that real interest rates would spike &#45; a painful thing &#45; or the Federal Reserve would have to become the sole buyer of government issuance &#45; overt monetization of the debt.&amp;nbsp; So many dollars will be willingly issued with no concern for value that it will be rendered worthless.
The boys&#39; had no idea about the constitutional issue regarding this act and I wouldn&#39;t expect them to.&amp;nbsp; But they were smart enough to appreciate the role of the market in this, which is frankly surprising since those who uphold the market are derided by the economist apologists as out of touch; the government can say and do anything because they&#39;re the government and their decree is what matters.&amp;nbsp; But Don Quixote believed in his imaginary world, where a windmill is a dragon and a whore a damsel.&amp;nbsp; If the United States Government plays the Don Quixote, abetted by the Federal Reserve&#39;s Sancho Panza, then the world will soon treat them &#45; and us &#45; with the same disregard.&amp;nbsp;
I&#39;m now wondering whether the money spent on college and economics courses will actually ruin the boys&#39; ability to think.</body>

<title>The Post-Mortem</title>
<body>All kids have their stories to tell and it&#39;s important to listen.&amp;nbsp; But if my job is to teach, then it&#39;s also important to dig further and help them ascertain what really happened and that can be unpleasant for both kid and father.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s why post&#45;mortems are difficult, because they expose the sometimes gruesome unpleasantness of why something occurred; but the post&#45;mortem can also serve to explain how to avoid having it happen all over again.
It was another of those playground incidents in which a kid loses his cool and in the heat of the moment, makes threats and then finally chucks an inflatable rubber ball into the face of another kid in a pique of anger.&amp;nbsp; Such was the story from one of my own kids, who was the recipient of the ball in the face and on telling the story, becoming rightly angry again.&amp;nbsp; The unfortunate problem was that I didn&#39;t just nod my head and sympathize out of blind loyalty, but began to ask questions about the incident; this was especially the case since the ball thrower had a reputation for becoming upset, but never before with Youngest.&amp;nbsp; After hearing the initial report, I asked him to begin again and as he progressed, I would stop him and ask for more detail.&amp;nbsp; What came through was that Youngest wasn&#39;t the cause of the initial situation and subsequent anger &#45; spilling the gas, so to speak &#45; but he did make a subsequent comment that lit the match, pushing the other kid over the edge.&amp;nbsp; His remark was under his breath, sotto voce, but it was overheard and that was the spark for the rubber ball explosion.&amp;nbsp; The quiet comment wasn&#39;t remotely helpful to the circumstance at hand.&amp;nbsp;
When I understood what happened, I asked what he&#39;d learned from the situation and when there was no response, I commented that he&#39;d figuratively lit a match and tossed it onto spilled gas; this wasn&#39;t an errant ball, but one that he did cause to be chucked at him.&amp;nbsp; The first lesson was that if he was going to make remarks, he had to be ready to stand by them.&amp;nbsp; The second lesson was that if there was situation between others, his best course of action was to keep his mouth shut and not make himself a target instead of others.
His response was one of anger and confusion, questioning why I&#39;d take the other child&#39;s side instead of his.&amp;nbsp; I had to explain that I wasn&#39;t and that the other child was clearly wrong for pegging him with the ball.&amp;nbsp; But there were lessons to be learned from the situation and my job was to help him learn those lessons so that this didn&#39;t happen again, getting hurt for no other reason than opening his mouth when it should have stayed shut.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t what a child would want to hear from Dad, but there it was in all of it&#39;s painful reality.
Everyone has a tendency to embellish their own story one way or another.&amp;nbsp; We make ourselves the heroes in good circumstances and frequently the victims when things don&#39;t go our way.&amp;nbsp; This is usually accentuated in children but I have seen a few adults who give the kids a run for their money.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s important for me, as a father, is to slow the process down and help my child figure out exactly what happened.&amp;nbsp; What the progression of events and at what point did things go off the rails?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not easy and sometimes impossible since kids are neither the most reliable nor objective storytellers in the known universe.&amp;nbsp; But it has to be attempted and if unsuccessful...well, at least you tried.&amp;nbsp; The only sure thing is that your child will be angry with you for not reflexively taking his side in the situation; but that&#39;s part and parcel of being the parent, because it has to happen.</body>

<title>Bankers Anonymous</title>
<body>While I&#39;ve tried to stay up on all that&#39;s been going on in the economic and financial mess, I&#39;m still an outsider and not privy to the inner workings of the financial machine.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s now a site that I&#39;d suggest that you follow and that&#39;s called Bankers&#45;Anonymous.com.
The aptly named site is written by a former Goldman employee and hedge fund manager who&#39;s come to view his former profession with a somewhat jaundiced eye.&amp;nbsp; He writes for those who are interested but don&#39;t have the knowledge base that he brings to the table.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the rest of us.
Take the time to read what he writes.&amp;nbsp; It will be time well and fruitfully spent.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; January 2013 Stable</title>
<body>Rupert Murdoch recently tweeted that we should expect &amp;quot;runaway inflation&amp;quot;, or at least that&#39;s what he had an assistant tweet, after the passage of the so&#45;called fiscal cliff deal in Congress.&amp;nbsp; The premise of the commentary centers around the simple fact that the dollar is a fiat currency and it&#39;s strength dependent solely upon the perceived ability of the American taxpayer to finance the national debt.&amp;nbsp; Load up on more debt and fail to make the necessary fiscal cuts and Joe and Jane World are going to say meh and begin shifting to some other currency, at which point, well...suffice it to say however, that inflation is precisely what the government and Federal Reserve want.&amp;nbsp; That said, they might have to wait another month as the pricing of the PracticalDad Price Index is complete for January 2013 and the powers that be didn&#39;t get their way.
There was a small decrease in the Total Index (47 grocery store items) from December&#39;s 108.07 to January&#39;s level of 108.01 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; However, there was a greater than full point drop in the Food only Index (the 37 food items comprised in the entire 47 item market basket), as the Food only Index dropped from December&#39;s 114.33 to January&#39;s 113.24.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t that so many items dropped across the board as much as one or two grocers of the three sampled were able to replace items with lower cost alternatives.&amp;nbsp; The most dramatic example of this was the effect of Senator Bernie Sanders&#39; Dexcember 2010 filibuster upon diaper prices.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know for certain whether there was a direct causal link, but Senator Sanders&#39; memorable refrain was ...they can&#39;t afford diapers... and several months later, a major grocer introduced a much lower cost box of diapers.&amp;nbsp; This particular month, a grocer introduced a much less expensive spaghetti sauce, something done by another grocer early in 2012.&amp;nbsp;
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread
11/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 107.06&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 113.04&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5.98
12/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 108.07&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 114.33&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6.26
01/13&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 108.01&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 113.24&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5.23
As the data above indicates, the spread &#45; the differential between food items and non&#45;food items &#45; dropped as well.&amp;nbsp; If the intent is to foster inflation, paying off debt with dollars of lesser value, then the Fed and government had better get back to the drawing board.&amp;nbsp; Only Congress can get away with slacking off in such a fashion.
I honestly found it hilarious to find that Rupert Murdoch had a Twitter account.&amp;nbsp; Smithers, come here and take a tweet...
And one last item for the record.&amp;nbsp; I do not have a Twitter account, but found last year that some enterprising Canadian woman had taken my online name for a Twitter account and had been sending out coupon and sales notices.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;d also set up a Twitter account with a moniker that closely resembled another website&#39;s name, doing the same thing.&amp;nbsp; So if you find yourself looking at a tweet from &amp;quot;PracticalDad&amp;quot;, rest assured that it&#39;s not me.

<title>We Are the Homebuilders, Not Them</title>
<body>Over the holidays, the most recent Case&#45;Shiller Index&amp;nbsp;results were released for October 2012&amp;nbsp;and the business media ran with them.&amp;nbsp; According to the data, while the index declined .1% from the previous month for both the 10 and 20 city indices, the two were up 4.3% and 3.4% respectively from October 2011.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s good &#45; for the financial sector &#45; since one of the primary reasons for the Fed&#39;s artificially low interest rates is to keep a prop under housing so as to keep any more ABS products from imploding.&amp;nbsp; But what continues to catch my attention is that the media predominantly refers to these as home prices, and not housing prices.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s been a fundamental change in our perspective in the last five decades, especially within the past three.&amp;nbsp; Spending on discretionary items rose significantly during the Fifties as rising income meant that the typical American family could not only cover the basics &#45; clothing, food, housing &#45; but also save and then have even more to spend on &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; things.&amp;nbsp; A young adult generation that came of age during the deprivation and fear of the Great Depression and Second World War basked in the relative ability to do as they pleased, even as they remembered the darkness that they&#39;d survived.&amp;nbsp; But that memory didn&#39;t get passed along to the subsequent generations even as the sense of entitlement grew.&amp;nbsp; The American family had to have more &#45; more televisions, more automobiles, larger houses &#45; in order to compete with their neighbors and more importantly, feed the new economic model of mass consumption.&amp;nbsp; Leisure became a principal preoccupation and ease of use a goal.&amp;nbsp; Swanson showed us that factory&#45;made frozen dinners could be preheated and the family could share their meal in front of the television set.&amp;nbsp; When mothers began entering the workforce and feeling the stress of juggling provider/homemaker roles, McDonald&#39;s told them that you deserve a break today, so go get up and get away...&amp;nbsp; The push to make things easy was on and has continued in full drive mode for decades now.&amp;nbsp;
This drive for the good life has carried over from the small things &#45; TV dinners and fast food &#45; to the larger ticket items and that now includes houses.&amp;nbsp; As residential development grew larger and builders began to market larger subdivisions, they appropriated the word home and made it their own.&amp;nbsp; For a generation of young adults that suffered&amp;nbsp;heavily from divorce and broken homes in their youth, the presented images of clean, spic and span homes with smiling families &#45; often unlike their own memories &#45; was a natural sell that played heavily upon their emotions and dreams.&amp;nbsp; Starting around 2007 and afterwards, many families found that the purchased dream was anything but.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t a home but merely a structure, and a pondeously heavy one at that.&amp;nbsp; There was nothing easy about having to manage the household and work to support an onerous mortgage, taken out to purchase far what was beyond one&#39;s means.
Understand the difference between a house and home.&amp;nbsp; A house is what&#39;s peddled by the real estate developers, a structure that&#39;s supposed to be sturdy enough to withstand elements and provide a roof over the heads of you and your children.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s nothing more than the accumulation of materials and time put in by construction workers until they move along to the next structure for the next family.&amp;nbsp; Yet&amp;nbsp;a home is more than that.&amp;nbsp; A home is a sense of belonging, a feeling that arises amongst the family members who all help to create it through shared activities and events, many of which are mundane yet still crucial to living a life.&amp;nbsp; Making the home clean, creating and sharing the meals, doing the&amp;nbsp;homework and participating in the various activities and celebrating the events that help the children learn and grow.&amp;nbsp; But creating a home requires work, persistent and sometimes difficult; we&#39;ve been so cumulatively lulled by the media messages that we forget how much challenge, thought and elbow grease can be involved in rearing children so that they can become &#45; seemingly impossible at moments &#45; productive and moral adults.&amp;nbsp;
Ignore the message of the homebuilders and take back the word home.&amp;nbsp; No builder will&amp;nbsp;appear at the child&#39;s ball game or concert.&amp;nbsp; No builder will awaken at 3 AM to comfort a child who&#39;s sick or had a nightmare.&amp;nbsp; No builder will respond to the call from the principal about misbehavior.&amp;nbsp; No builder will spend the money &#45; let alone time &#45; to pay for the activity that so interests the child.&amp;nbsp; No builder will quiz the child on spelling or scientific principles and no builder will walk through the report card results with them at quarter&#39;s end.&amp;nbsp; All of these are only a small part and parcel of what&#39;s involved in creating a home and at no time have I ever seen a builder&#39;s representative present.&amp;nbsp; The physical structure in which you live &#45; single family, apartment, condo &#45; are usually irrelevant to any of these things.
They build the houses.
We build the homes.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Why Bother Saving?</title>
<body>You don&#39;t tug on Superman&#39;s cape,
You don&#39;t spit in the wind,
You don&#39;t pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger
And you don&#39;t mess around with Jim.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45;You Don&#39;t Mess Around with Jim (Jim Croce, 1972)
And if the financial authorities have their way, you never, ever save.&amp;nbsp; With the prevailing rates kept artificially low &#45; I recently saw an online ad touting a terrific APR of .9% &#45; and the advertising drumbeat continuing to push consumption, the economic system is set to continue driving everyday Americans to spend and consume.&amp;nbsp; But the ability to save is crucial and is especially important for the kids to learn as we prepare them for their future.&amp;nbsp; They face an economic future that will be radically different from what we ourselves faced as children and their ability to live within their means will be crucial to their well&#45;being as they face choices that we never faced.
There&#39;s been a recurrent mantra throughout the years with the kids, one that&#39;s typically uttered when one or more of life&#39;s speedbumps occurs:&amp;nbsp; ...and that&#39;s why we save.&amp;nbsp; Writing the check for an electrician&#39;s or plumber&#39;s visit?&amp;nbsp; ...and that&#39;s why we save. &amp;nbsp;Having to replace an old used car that hit a deer?&amp;nbsp; ...and that&#39;s why we save. &amp;nbsp;Paying to register a kid for any number of the activities?&amp;nbsp; ...and that&#39;s why we save. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not a mantra that&#39;s shouted in their ears as the check is waved in front of their faces, but one that&#39;s repeated often enough that at some point in the future, they&#39;ll recognize it as they go about their adult financial activities.&amp;nbsp; My mother&#39;s mantra &#45; gotta pay the mortgage &#45; began to surface in my own brain when I was a young adult now responsible for myself.&amp;nbsp; Gee, mebbe I can buy that little Miata and take a trip to Cancun with co&#45;workers (...gotta pay the mortgage). &amp;nbsp;After a few moments of assessing my paycheck, I did neither. &amp;nbsp;
There are certain things that we&#39;ve explicitly done &#45; or tried to do &#45; with the kids through the years.

    Direct a specific percentage of their allowances, and paychecks when older, to their savings account so that they learn that such a thing exists.
    When they ask for something, talk through whether they actually need that item or simply want it.&amp;nbsp; The follow&#45;up, typically with toys and electronic games, is to point out that they already items similar to the requested item.&amp;nbsp; Gee, son, a Nerf Rapid&#45;Fire gun would be great but you already have two other Nerf guns and have lost all of the darts...
    Ask them to contribute some of their own savings for pricier items or events.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that the first grader chips in for amusement park tickets, but high school students can chip in a portion of the cost of a chorus trip to a distant city; this is especially the case when fundraising opportunities are available.
    Decide what&#39;s appropriate for the cost of adult items, such as chipping in on gas or on insurance for the car.
    When the kid starts talking about purchasing this or that particular item, talk with them about what else is hanging out there in terms of needs and/or wants.&amp;nbsp; The kids truly aren&#39;t used to thinking in these terms and on more than one occasion, a light has gone on behind the eyes and the commentary has been shelved.

There is presently no true financial rationale for saving, even if for no other reason than to avoid having to pay the interest cost of plunking something on the credit card.&amp;nbsp; Some might have the discipline to immediately pay the items off and run with whatever points or rewards are offered with the card, but the reality is that most will not.&amp;nbsp; The payoff however, will be in the future because the rates cannot stay at these levels indefinitely and when they snap back to higher levels &#45; and reversion to the mean is a bitch &#45; times will be truly harder than what they are at present.&amp;nbsp; Anybody with memory of the interest rate spikes of the early 1980s recalls that these were accompanied by wrenching economic pain; couple that with today&#39;s reality of dropping incomes and fewer benefits and what we face in the future will be horribly memorable in its own right.&amp;nbsp; The flip side is that those who are capable of living within their means and saving money will be able to actually prosper.
There is a reset of the economic system coming, although I don&#39;t profess to know whether it&#39;s coming in the form of a stock market crash, rampant inflation or even the Sta&#45;Puff Marshmallow Man.&amp;nbsp; My job is help cut through the crap foisted by our economic system and teach the kids so that they don&#39;t wind up scarred and crushed by economic hardships because they didn&#39;t know better.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Father (for) Christmas</title>
<body>We spend much of our lives in a forest for the trees environment, pressed by details that keep us from seeing the big picture.&amp;nbsp; Many men see themselves as the junior member in the parenting partnership, noting how the mothers seem so much more at ease with the kids and consequently step back from the daily merry&#45;go&#45;round that is part and parcel of raising children.&amp;nbsp; The thought is that I&#39;m really not that important here and they need their mother more than me...
It is a real thought process for more than a few fathers.&amp;nbsp; But fathers do make a huge difference in the kids&#39; lives and their presence is missed when they&#39;re not there or involved.&amp;nbsp; This was borne out by an English survey of 2000 parents, who were asked what their children asked for; the results were compiled into a roster of the fifty most requested Christmas gifts.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m not certain of the full list, what was relevant here was that &amp;quot;a father&amp;quot; was the tenth most requested Christmas gift.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not #1 on the list, but it&#39;s certainly not at the bottom either and it&#39;s a testament to what men bring to the table as parents.&amp;nbsp;
So when you start to wonder how much you really matter or whether you&#39;re just as important as mom &#45; and no, I don&#39;t plan to choose one over another &#45; consider the Christmas list.&amp;nbsp; And have a wonderful season.

<title>Sending Off the Kids</title>
<body>The news from Danbury, Connecticut strikes home with a visceral fear as the reality is that this madness isn&#39;t relegated to a third world nation or ghetto free&#45;fire zone.&amp;nbsp; This happened in a small town with a school that probably looks very similar to most other elementary schools across the country.&amp;nbsp; When Youngest came home, I met him on the front porch and gave him a hug and when he goes to school in the morning, I&#39;ll see him off from the front porch again.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s statistically highly unlikely that anything is going to happen and I&#39;ll see him again in the afternoon, the randomness and severity of the violence gives me a lingering sense that this is akin to watching a teenage child leave for service in the military.&amp;nbsp; On top of the shootings at Columbine, Nickel Mine and Virginia Tech, there&#39;s a raw feeling that anything can happen and I had better make it a goodbye when he departs.
Like many people, I wonder what&#39;s happening in our society that this is occurring with seemingly greater prevalence and I certainly have some opinions.&amp;nbsp; But when the family discussed it this weekend, Eldest &#45; home for college break &#45; commented that she felt it disrespectful that Facebook and other social media was full of opinion and invective so soon on the heels of this tragedy.&amp;nbsp; My two cents will consequently wait as she&#39;s correct.
What I will offer is that you take an extra moment when you last see the kids and give them another squeeze, or if the teens are grumpy, suck up the annoyance and give thanks that they&#39;re there to annoy you at all.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve tried to do with mixed success but will make the extra effort going forward.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>The Conversation</title>
<body>Most fundamentally, the question is whether people are fully understanding of the limits to central banks&#39; abilities.  It is, to repeat, not to be critical of actions to date to wonder  whether private market participants, and perhaps more importantly  governments, recognise what central banks cannot do. Central  banks can provide liquidity to shore up financial stability and they can  buy time for borrowers to adjust. But they cannot, in the end, put  government finances on a sustainable course and they cannot create the  real resources that need to be found from somewhere to strengthen bank  capital. They cannot costlessly correct earlier misallocation of real  capital investment. They cannot shield people from the implications of  having mis&#45;assessed their own life&#45;time budget constraints and as a  result having consumed too much.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Glenn Stephens, Governor, Royal Bank of Australia
Serendipity lives and this quote came on the cusp of a long, rambling conversation with Middle the other evening after watching Will Ferrell&#39;s The Campaign.&amp;nbsp;  One of the perks of living in this household is that as the kids get a little older, I&#39;ll occasionally permit them to watch an R&#45;rated movie with the proviso that I have the opportunity to pause and explain a few things.&amp;nbsp; First on the list was that the film&#39;s fictitious Motch Brothers &#45; Dan Aykroyd and John Lithgow &#45; are satires on the real&#45;life billionaire Koch Brothers, who muscled into the nascent Tea Party Movement for their own personal benefit.&amp;nbsp; Second on the list was the plot twist by the brothers to purchase up the congressional district and then import Chinese workers; for the brothers, it was a win&#45;win with no shipping costs and almost slave labor wages.&amp;nbsp;
But it was at the China juncture that the conversation took flight as it turned</body>

<title>You&#8217;ve Come a Long Way, Buddy&#8230;But You Can&#8217;t Have It All</title>
<body>Change usually happens incrementally and with such stealth that it creeps into your consciousness like an ex&#45;boyfriend slipping into the backpew of the wedding service.&amp;nbsp; But occasionally, you get that instant aha! moment when you see something that registers immediately.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case when I took Middle for an annual physical last week and realized that the doctor&#39;s office was full of men and that all of them had babies and toddlers.
There was a time when I took the kids &#45; much younger then &#45; to the pediatrician&#39;s office and found myself the sole non&#45;physician male in the entire office.&amp;nbsp; Mothers and grandmothers were there with kids of all ages and for any number of reasons and there I sat, reading a well&#45;thumbed Dr Seuss book to one or two children while I awaited the call of our name.&amp;nbsp; But last week was eye&#45;opening on multiple levels.&amp;nbsp; The first level was the simple presence of so many fathers concentrated in one area, actually outnumbering the number of women who weren&#39;t on staff; there were mothers in the area, but there appeared to be more fathers there.&amp;nbsp; The next level was the earliest years with the kids were spent in the DC region, which would certainly qualify as one of the forerunners in the fatherhood movement as men became more involved.&amp;nbsp;  But last week&#39;s excursion was to a suburban physician&#39;s office in a very politically and socially conservative area.&amp;nbsp;  There were men there with their wives, but I noted several bringing multiple kids in by themselves and all that I could think of was a paraphrase of the old commercial tagline, you&#39;ve come a long way, buddy.
The 1970s seems to be the definitive decade for when the family structure began to go off of the rails.&amp;nbsp; It was an economically difficult decade that really pushed more women to go back to the workforce and the increasingly vocal Feminist movement &#45; born in the late 1960s &#45; made it socially and politically acceptable for this to happen and women went back to the workforce in much greater numbers.&amp;nbsp; The increased rise of the Great Society welfare program led to a literal destruction of the paternal figure in the inner city.&amp;nbsp; Finally, the increased acceptance of no&#45;fault divorce made divorce far easier to obtain yet the delay in the recognition that fathers could also be fit parents led to true hardship for fathers.&amp;nbsp; Advertisers watched this and jumped aboard the bandwagon to target products to this new and potent feminist wife/mother market and rolled out such taglines as you&#39;ve come a long way, baby and she can bring home the bacon, fry it up in a pan (and never, never let you forget you&#39;re a man).&amp;nbsp; The decades passed and as wages slowly closed the gender gap &#45; and yes, I know that there&#39;s still a discrepancy &#45; and women moved into upper echelons, there were any number of publications and articles that told women you can have it all as it showed pictures of attractive mothers in upscale clothing playing with the kids or working around the house.&amp;nbsp; But the difference was that more and more of those decades&#39; kids grew up seeing that Mom was actually being pulled and twisted like taffy to make things work while Dad simply wasn&#39;t a factor in many cases.
We&#39;re now two generations removed from that initial period and the kids are parents in their own rite.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re not stupid and have watched what their parents went through and in many cases have decided that there has to be a better way.&amp;nbsp; Men want to be the fathers to their kids that they often didn&#39;t have and the women want help so that there&#39;s some sense of balance; they want to be a person with a life, not a Twizzler.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s recognition that there&#39;s a cost to having it all and it isn&#39;t only financial, but also physical, emotional and even moral.&amp;nbsp; So more fathers are taking the opportunity to take up the slack with the kids in the daily life and that&#39;s only fair, even if they know that it puts a serious crimp in the career plans.&amp;nbsp; They understand in today&#39;s world that while it can be hurt to have the employer let them go, it&#39;s far more painful to know that their child let them go.
You can&#39;t have it all.&amp;nbsp; Ignore anyone that tells you that you can.</body>

<title>A Trend in Tuition Cuts?</title>
<body>The wolf will live with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the goat, the calf and the lion and the yearling together; and a little child will lead them.&amp;nbsp;
Isaiah 11:6
On the cusp of the announcement by catholic&amp;nbsp; Belmont Abbey College that they were cutting their annual tuition by a full third starting in 2013, it only seemed appropriate to lead with a biblical quote.&amp;nbsp; The news over the wire was that the college was cutting tuition by $10000 to about $18000 starting in 2013 and in the announcement, they stated that they were doing it in response to the ongoing disproportionate rise of college tuition over the past two decades.&amp;nbsp; I have to applaud their action as they acknowledge in their statement that many good students are discouraged from applying to colleges based on the published price alone.&amp;nbsp;  They are realizing that the financial maneuvers in the college financials appear to be, as one close friend stated, just so much funny money; both she and we were told to ignore the published price and focus on the actual price, net of grants, work&#45;study and loans.&amp;nbsp; The process is confusing to many and can be offputting, as more and more kids and families look at things and say to hell with it.&amp;nbsp;
In all fairness, Belmont Abbey isn&#39;t actually the first small school to cut their tuition but they are among the first of several small schools &#45; the little children &#45; who are saying enough.&amp;nbsp; Part of it is, I believe, an actual sense that things truly are out of control and that they have a moral obligation to do what they can in both the micro and macro sense of helping to lead the way.&amp;nbsp; Part of it is also simply an act of enlightened self&#45;interest as the understanding that folks are staying away because of the published price.&amp;nbsp; While Belmont Abbey states that they&#39;re in a good position with new infrastructure and a full class of students, they also are looking at the other trends in American society and recognizing that if they aren&#39;t in trouble now, then they will be.&amp;nbsp;
While the much higher rise in college costs is the major factor in the equation, it&#39;s now being slowly eclipsed by the realization that the ever&#45;dependable middle class is being throttled.&amp;nbsp; Since the recession of 2007, family incomes have declined and there&#39;s simply no sign that they&#39;re coming back as the majority of jobs being created are part&#45;time only and more Americans are forced to eat courtesy of local food banks and the US Government&#39;s SNAP program.&amp;nbsp; Barring an economic miracle to massively bolster family incomes, and that&#39;s not remotely likely, then the institutions will be forced to make the cuts themselves and put the word out.&amp;nbsp; While some may think that the colleges are panicking, the rule of thumb is that he who panics first panics best and those institutions will be ahead of the curve.&amp;nbsp;
So if Belmont Abbey&#39;s action gains legs and spreads, that&#39;s only part of the battle.&amp;nbsp; There should also be work done to make the process easier to understand for the average family, and that&#39;s something that can be done by the higher education establishment.&amp;nbsp; But the families have to do their part and actually pay attention to the process and not simply leave it to the hands of the kids who don&#39;t have the experience necessary to adequately assess all of the complexities in the process.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t even consider what would be necessary on a national level to stem the economic decline at the family level.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Kids and Gun Control</title>
<body>That anybody takes another human life is a tragedy, compounded by the subsequent suicide in front of others.&amp;nbsp;  Lives are altered in so many ways and the recriminations begin as fingers point in so many directions,. fingers often pointed by people who compound shock with cluelessness in vain search of an answer.&amp;nbsp; That it happened is terrible enough but now comments are being made that add fuel to the fire for gun control, most especially Bob Costas and his halftime commentary about gun control.&amp;nbsp; The gist of his remark was that young men are incapable of self&#45;control and that permitting them ready access to weapons is simply setting the stage for tragedy.&amp;nbsp; But what does this mean when a family is about to train the kids in the use of firearms?&amp;nbsp; Is Costas right in his comments that our youngsters are incapable of self&#45;control and thus in far greater danger by sheer dint of ready access to weapons?
The comments are outlandish, but timely since we&#39;re going to proceed with firearms training come Spring.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not a survivalist and have no bunker accessible via a hidden passage beneath the fishpond waterfall, but we will &#45; now that the youngest is old enough &#45; teach them how to use the firearms safely.&amp;nbsp; This is partially for the sheer fun of it as well as the fact that society has grown coarser and more violent and I want to be sure that they have a firm handle on things.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a greater availability of gun and firearm games on various platforms, such as Xbox and Wii, and while we&#39;ve worked hard to control access, I know that they&#39;re playing with friends at their houses; if they&#39;re going to do so, I want to assure that they actually have an understanding of the real thing.&amp;nbsp; This is akin to finally letting the nine year&#45;old watch Saving Private Ryan so that he has a clue that the violence in warfare isn&#39;t the sterile, harmless type that they&#39;re fed online.&amp;nbsp;
There are several issues that I have with the comments and controversy arising from the tragedy.&amp;nbsp;

    The first is the confusion that&#39;s shown by some commentators about the Second Amendment.&amp;nbsp; The fact that we have a significant standing mililtary doesn&#39;t mean that weapons for the populace is unnecesary; part of the right to own arms is that the citizenry have the right to protect themselves from the government should things slide out of control.&amp;nbsp; While we depended upon a militia at the founding of the nation instead of a standing army, there was real concern that the populace also be able to defend themselves from tyranny.
    The second is that this is a response to an exceptionally high profile case; there isn&#39;t the outcry over the chronic gun violence that permeates inner city America or the Mexican border and I doubt that this incident should throw the whole thing over into a repeal of the Second Amendment.
    The third is the simple realization that football is a violent sport and a profession that rewards violence; the men who play football are, as a whole, more aggressive than the average person.&amp;nbsp; This means that these men live their lives with a familiarity of violence that the large majority of Americans don&#39;t understand.&amp;nbsp; Their world is contact and damage and while I don&#39;t expect that the great majority are going to wander around beating the average joe to a pulp, I do expect that they have a greater sense than the average joe of how situations can go awry and lead to violence and they want to be certain that they&#39;re protected.
    The fourth point is that I don&#39;t view this tragedy as one that&#39;s attributable solely to Belcher&#39;s age and gender, but one that&#39;s ultimately attributable to some degree of instability and mental illness.&amp;nbsp; This is a man who lost control and after killing his girlfriend &#45; the mother of his child &#45; was overwhelmed by remorse to the extreme.&amp;nbsp; This situation could have easily occurred, and does, within the general population.&amp;nbsp; If a plumber goes kills another and then himself, we don&#39;t blame it on his age and gender.

What Costas should refer to is a situation akin to the controversy surrounding sportswriter Jason Whidlock&#39;s criticism of Colin Kaepernick&#39;s tattoos.&amp;nbsp; Whidlock&#39;s commentary was that the extreme tattooing was symbolic of a prison culture that didn&#39;t jibe with the persona of a professional quarterback; this does tie into the gun violence issue in that multiple football players have been embroiled in the past decade in the thuggish behavior that derives from the gangsta mentality of the inner city gang.&amp;nbsp; Multiple players &#45; Adam &amp;quot;Pacman&amp;quot; Jones, Santana Moss, Ray Lewis &#45; have been involved in deadly situations with gun usage.&amp;nbsp; Along with Michael Vick&#39;s dogfighting, these evolved from the violent, unstable mentality fostered by the inner city gangs in which nobody else matters but another member of your own group.&amp;nbsp;
So how does this relate to my own family scenario?&amp;nbsp; The gangs have always existed, but have especially flourished in the broken family environment of the inner city.&amp;nbsp; The gang becomes the family to the member instead of the parents and siblings and the gang imprints its own family &amp;quot;values&amp;quot; onto the new member.&amp;nbsp; While these values permit and encourage the use of weapons, they do nothing to teach the responsibility that must extend naturally with the potential of the weapon.&amp;nbsp; Guns are simply symbolic of the real issue here, the rise and celebration of the gangsta culture via popular media and electronic gaming; a culture that sprouted from the destruction of the family in the inner cities.
If Costas wants to focus his attention somewhere, then he should focus it here.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m angry that in their view, so many responsible families will suffer for the irresponsibility of the few who flourished and fell in the rise of the gangsta&amp;nbsp;culture.&amp;nbsp; I live in a state in which hunting and firearms flourish and I know of so many parents who take great care to assure that their children understand and respect the power of the gun.&amp;nbsp; Ths issues are so much deeper than portrayed in the media and I resent that for a few, the ready elimination of a symbol is tantamount to resolving the issue.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re going to have or bring a weapon into the house, be certain to exercise the responsibility that comes with it so that the media monster isn&#39;t fed with even more fodder.</body>

<title>The New Housing Kool-Aid</title>
<body>As they say, /rant on.
While taking a moment to check some online news, I came across a headline banner proclaiming the benefits of purchasing a new home instead of a used one.&amp;nbsp; This is probably the first headline banner that I&#39;ve clicked in more than a year just because...well, just because I was curious.&amp;nbsp; The site is a product of some construction advertising LLC and proudly exclaims all of the many reasons that purchasing a new home is sooooo much better than a used home.&amp;nbsp; For instance, you can relax in it knowing that you&#39;re the first to ever own it; that you can configure the house to your desires instead of configuring your family to meet the floorplan; that it can have the highest quality materials and energy efficiency; that many of these are located in posh developments with attractive amenities (cue picture of mansion with lit pool in front of it).
My thinking and philosophy &#45; and writing &#45; has changed dramatically since I created this site in 2008.&amp;nbsp; The thrust of real&#45;world education for the kids is that they&#39;re going to live in a world of markedly fewer opportunities than were afforded to most of my generation and that in today&#39;s society, the corporation rules to the detriment of the individual. They will be catered to and feted via advertising with the sole purpose of becoming good consumers charged with the task of spending their money on the latest and greatest gadgetry even if it makes no significant difference to their ultimate well&#45;being (want/need).&amp;nbsp; The goal of advertising is, indeed, to convince the individual about what their ultimate well&#45;being actually is.
But this kind of banner advertising isn&#39;t accounting for the real world, the world in which we live.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t account for the world in which the median American family income has dropped about $5000 since the 2007 recession and the majority of new jobs are part&#45;time without any benefits.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s actually driving the banner ad is the actual desperation of the builders as they see ongoing mediocre demand for new housing and the competition that&#39;s coming from the much lower cost stock of existing homes; that industry sees that people are nervous about their world and happy to mix up a potent batch of new Kool&#45;Aid for the public to consume.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, if the median family income has dropped by such an extent, is it in the best interests of your own family to stretch and shoot for that demographic?&amp;nbsp;
If nothing else, it goes back to a purposeful obfuscation on their part, a deliberate confusion that purchasing this building makes it a home.&amp;nbsp; This is the ultimate example of the age of self&#45;gratification, that you purchase a ready&#45;made structure home much as you could toss a TV dinner into the oven in the 1950s and call it a family meal.&amp;nbsp; What you are buying is a structure, a house that will take considerable work and effort on your part to create a home for the family.&amp;nbsp; A house is built from physical materials, a home is made from the family&#39;s values and habits, it&#39;s practices and love.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s fine to look and dream about what if for the kids and family, but take the images with a grain of salt.&amp;nbsp; If you want Kool&#45;Aid, go to the grocer instead of the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;builder.
/rant off.

<title>Then and Now:&nbsp; Food Prices in December 2010 and 2012</title>
<body>Pay attention to the news and you hear that the CPI has increased by .x% for a particular month, at an annualized rate of y%.&amp;nbsp; You also shop and can see that, somehow, the price of something has risen.&amp;nbsp; But by how much and what does this mean in terms of reality?&amp;nbsp; I thought that it would beneficial to look back at the prices for items in the PracticalDad grocery basket in 2010 and then compare them with the prices today.&amp;nbsp;
What a family buys at a grocery store is more than just food, and includes items for the household and body, such as paper towels, feminine products/pads and diapers.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s these three items that by themselves, comprise a full 20% of the basket&#39;s dollar value and it&#39;s these three items that have been either seen no price change or an actual drop in the past two years.&amp;nbsp; This means that their presence in the basket hides the effect of price rises on other items and it&#39;s for this reason that I began to split out the food costs earlier this year.&amp;nbsp; While the full Index of 47 items rose by 8% since November 2010, the cost of the 37 food items increased by a higher 14%.
Items that are obviously related to commodities saw the greatest rises, such as bread (wheat), orange juice, coffee and cooking (canola) oil.&amp;nbsp; Others saw more moderate increases but the large majority of items within the basket saw an increase of one kind or another.&amp;nbsp; Following is a short recap of some of the items at random.
Item&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; % Rise
Cans Green Beans, Peas, Corn&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 11
Hot dog rolls (8 ct)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 18
Sugar Flakes Cereal (generic 17 oz)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 19
Oatmeal (42 oz generic)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 11.9
Butter (1 #, generic unsalted)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5.2
Peanut Butter (28 oz generic)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 46
Coffee (13 oz generic)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 36
Hot Dogs (1 # franks, generic)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6.5
Carrots (2 # bag)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 28
OJ (64 oz, generic)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 22.9
Why did prices rise?&amp;nbsp;

    In some instances, it&#39;s the result of simple supply such as a failed peanut crop in late 2011 and early 2012.&amp;nbsp; The supply of peanuts was so constrained that some stores actually had a limit on how many jars of peanut butter could be purchased at any one time.&amp;nbsp; The same occurred this Fall with apples as a poor apple crop in some parts of the country led to higher prices.&amp;nbsp; The cost of a gallon of apple cider locally spiked recently to $6.99.
    In the case of certain commodities, it&#39;s frankly related to ongoing lax easy money policies.&amp;nbsp; Major investors &#45; including large investment houses and hedge funds &#45; look at the environment for investing and push money to assets that are tangible and will have an ongoing demand.&amp;nbsp; People don&#39;t actually have to purchase iPods or Chevy Volts, but they do have to feed themselves and their families so the money for the futures contracts flows to those items.&amp;nbsp; If you recall the movie Trading Places with Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy, the corollary plot pertained to the acquisition and use of inside information on the orange harvest.
    Some items see their rises because of corollary rises in other products.&amp;nbsp; The cost of generic sugar flakes cereal rose higher than oatmeal or generic rice chex cereal because the sugar and wheat ingredients saw rises of greater than 10%.&amp;nbsp; Canola oil saw a major spike in 2011 because crude oil&#39;s spike led to an increased demand for biofuels; since the canola crop also goes to biofuel, the increased demand for canola led to a corresponding rise in the cost of the cooking oil.&amp;nbsp; The price of a pound of ground beef (80% lean) rose 30% over the past two years and a significant spike occurred across the three surveyed grocery stores after a media brouhaha over the use of pink slime; the rationale behind the increase would be that grocery chains eliminated the additive and were forced to raise prices accordingly.&amp;nbsp;

There is one thing to takeaway from this and that&#39;s the realization that in most cases, prices aren&#39;t going to go down once they rise.&amp;nbsp; There can be circumstances that lead to price decreases, such a new supplier providing an item for a grocer, but by and large the cost of food isn&#39;t going to magically decline once it rises.&amp;nbsp;
Plan accordingly.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index for December 2012:&nbsp; The Basket Cost is Accelerating</title>
<body>The afternoon and evening were spent determining the results of the 47 item PracticalDad grocery market basket and the results were a bit startling.&amp;nbsp; Listed below are the results for December&#39;s Total and Food&#45;only Indices, along with the previous two months.  For a complete list of the 47 basket items, see here.
Month&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spread
10/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 106.42&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 111.80&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5.38
11/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 107.06&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 113.04&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5.98
12/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 108.07&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 114.33&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6.26
The total cost of the basket rose to an average of $192.79 for a December 2012 index level of 108.07 (November 2010 = 100); this is a full point increase from the November 2012 index level of 107.06.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, the cost of purchasing the same 47 items since November 2010 has risen more than 8%.
What caught my eye was that when the ten non&#45;food items (such as foil, soap, shampoo, diapers, etc.) are stripped from the basket and foodstuffs alone are considered, the Food&#45;only Index has risen further and at an even higher rate than the Total Index.&amp;nbsp; The Food&#45;only Index actually rose more than 1.25 points to an index reading of 114.33 (November 2010 = 100); the upshot is that considering the 37 food items alone (such as eggs, milk, a pound of ground beef, sugar, etc.), the cost of buying the same identical foodstuff items has risen 14.33% from November 2010.
The &amp;quot;Spread&amp;quot; column refers to the difference between the two indices &#45; the 37 food item index and the complete 47 item index &#45; and is indicative of the way that food prices alone are rising when compared against a basket that also comprises non&#45;food items.&amp;nbsp; I make no pretense it is a statistically valid measure given the paucity of items, but it is a measure that&#39;s more easily comprehensible to the average person.&amp;nbsp; The long and the short of the spread is that it shows that when the effect of non&#45;food prices are stripped away, the basket&#39;s food prices themselves are increasing at an even greater pace.</body>

<title>The Kid Doesn&#8217;t Wanna&#8230;</title>
<body>Youngest and I went on a recent hike with a group on a cold mid&#45;November morning, meeting the others in a local parking lot.&amp;nbsp; When I arrived, one of the kid hikers &#45; in upper elementary school &#45; stood in the parking lot next to his parent&#39;s van wearing nylon gym shorts, a t&#45;shirt and thin cotton windbreaker.&amp;nbsp; The parents weren&#39;t going along with the boy, who would be with a group of us.&amp;nbsp; When I walked over and said hello, he commenced yakking with Youngest and I quietly asked his parent whether that attire would really be sufficient for a long hike in chilly temperatures; the forecast called for gusty winds and as it turned out, brief snow flurries.&amp;nbsp; The adult looked at me and stated that that&#39;s what he always wore in cold weather, he didn&#39;t wanna wear long pants and heavier clothing so that&#39;s what he was going in.&amp;nbsp;
The kid didn&#39;t wanna.&amp;nbsp; Seriously?&amp;nbsp; Seriously?&amp;nbsp; I mean, seriously?&amp;nbsp;
Since I was the guy who planned this hike of almost ten miles, it was up to me to decide whether or not I&#39;d make an issue of it.&amp;nbsp; I commented that the boy was liable to become cold and the guy stated that that&#39;s what the boy always wore and that he&#39;d be alright.&amp;nbsp; My verbal response was okay but the mental response was far more prolific.&amp;nbsp; I grew up in a &quot;highway household&quot; in which the parental mantra was my way or the highway and I&#39;d frankly fought this particular battle in my household on innumerable occasions until the older kids reached an age that they&#39;d learned to suffer well from their choices.&amp;nbsp; My own personal decision was that the boy was going to have to suffer from his choice and parent&#39;s unwillingness to press the issue.&amp;nbsp; When we reached a later point in the hike in which the wind was blowing across the open fields and the boy was visibly shivering, my only response was to suggest that he zip up the windbreaker and hustle a little faster.&amp;nbsp; I wasn&#39;t about to play the dutiful parent and offer my own fleece jacket to keep him warm;&amp;nbsp; in my mind, my obligation was to bring the kid back alive and unharmed and if he&#39;d been attacked by wild dogs, I&#39;d protect him.&amp;nbsp; But I was damned if I &#45; or anyone else &#45; was going to suffer for his own parent&#39;s unwillingness to be the adult for his own kid.&amp;nbsp;
The reality is that parenting can be unpleasant &#45; damnably so &#45; at times.&amp;nbsp; Kids naturally push the boundaries as they grow and try to assert their independence and judgment and it can occasionally require Solomon&#39;s wisdom to ascertain when they&#39;re alright in doing so and when they need to toe your line;&amp;nbsp; there have frankly been any number of instances when my own choice led to unnecessary frustration on the part of both sides and I can look back and say woulda, shoulda.&amp;nbsp; What bothered me now was that the kid was going to be out of the parent&#39;s presence and any issues would have to be handled by me or another parent.  If I&#39;m going to have an Opie along &#45; and that&#39;s pretty often &#45; then I don&#39;t want to be in the position of having to pick up for the other parent&#39;s unwillingness to be the adult.&amp;nbsp; When my kids are in someone else&#39;s care, there&#39;s an expectation that the other parent will be responsible for them but that doesn&#39;t extend to even meeting their minimal needs simply because I don&#39;t want to deal with any unpleasantries.&amp;nbsp;
If there&#39;s ever a time to deal with the tantrums and rancor, it&#39;s when they&#39;re youngest.&amp;nbsp; As they grow, they&#39;ll learn that while they push the boundaries and learn to actually argue with you on a more mature level &#45; Dad, this is why I think that I should be allowed to wear pants like these... &#45; they&#39;ll also become used to the notion that you&#39;re actually the parent with a final say.&amp;nbsp;
I owe my children my adulthood.&amp;nbsp; This means that I&#39;ll have to wrestle with the unpleasant moments because it&#39;s ultimately in their own best interests that I do so.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t have the experience or the judgment to determine when something is ultimately harmful in the long run, such as wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather.&amp;nbsp; But thinking of them is only part of the equation since there&#39;s also a duty to the other parents who have to deal with my child in my absence and I owe them what I in turn would want for myself when managing their kids in their absence.&amp;nbsp; It creates discord in their own household as their kids naturally point at the Opies and throw their own behavior back in the parents&#39; faces, and the folks in turn are forced to not only try to explain their own rationale, but explain the reasoning of those other parents.&amp;nbsp; The simple truth is that I&#39;ve actually explained the behavior of other parents by remarking they let it occur just because they&#39;re idiots, son.
If your own kid doesn&#39;t wanna, please be sure that he&#39;s old enough to live with the results of his choices.nbsp; If he isn&#39;t old enough, make sure that you&#39;re around to contend with him because he&#39;s liable to not like my own response to the consequences of his (in)actions and kvetching.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Lincoln</title>
<body>Go see this movie. Take your children, even though they may occasionally  be confused or fidgety. Boredom and confusion are also part of  democracy, after all. &amp;ldquo;Lincoln&amp;rdquo; is a rough and noble democratic  masterpiece &amp;mdash; an omen, perhaps, that movies for the people shall not  perish from the earth.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; A.O. Scott, New York Times, November 9, 2012
That is precisely what I did as Middle and Youngest, and Middle&#39;s girlfriend, came along this weekend to see Spielberg&#39;s Lincoln.&amp;nbsp; While I don&#39;t know the age of Mr. Scott&#39;s own children, I do know that the material wasn&#39;t beyond the grasp of an intelligent ten year&#45;old so long as there was some pre&#45; and post&#45;movie background provided.&amp;nbsp; While this particular adventure pertained to a movie, it goes to the larger matter that as a father, my greatest job is to help prepare the children for living in the great wide world and the state of American politics and the questions of personal liberty, security and the Constitution certainly are addressed in this film.
The film itself was superb, everything that I&#39;d expect from Kushner and Spielberg; it leaned heavily upon Doris Kearns Goodwin&#39;s 2006 book, Team of Rivals, a good history but definitely improved with the personal touch that comes from the visual work of Spielberg.&amp;nbsp; But to appreciate it in its entirety, it requires a basic level of knowledge that many of our kids lack today.&amp;nbsp; What was striking even before the movie trailers ran was that Middle leaned over and whispered Dad, you&#39;re like the fourth youngest person here and when I glanced about at the several dozen viewers present, he was right.&amp;nbsp; Middle could appreciate it since he&#39;s immersed in an Honors Civics course and it was his education that provided the impetus for the evening; Youngest however, could still appreciate it since we&#39;d recently completed a ten mile hike at Gettysburg and is a budding history buff.&amp;nbsp;
Apart from simply seeing a Spielberg film and having the kids learn something (hopefully), I had certain goals for the three kids.&amp;nbsp; My first goal was to help them understand that history isn&#39;t some dry subject but a living process, made by flesh and blood individuals who suffer, strive and often act only upon faith with no guarantee of ultimate success.&amp;nbsp; Lincoln &#45; like all of our forebears &#45; was flesh and blood and not a demi&#45;god as we&#39;ve made them all to be.&amp;nbsp; The second goal was to help them understand that the Constitution is largely a document of parameters and rules, not an explicit guide of regulations or an assembly book for government.&amp;nbsp; As during the Civil War, our society is beset by questions of the balance between personal liberties and national security.&amp;nbsp; Lincoln took great efforts to protect and defend the Constitution upon his inauguration and in doing so, he ran roughshod over basic precepts of free speech and habeas corpus; he admits as much to his cabinet during a scene in the film as they demand to understand why he believes it so important to enact the 13th amendment.&amp;nbsp; These larger questions aren&#39;t new and will continue to haunt us.
The most interesting exchanges about the movie occurred during the next evening&#39;s meal as the film was described to my wife, who was out of town the previous evening.&amp;nbsp; She glanced at Middle and inquired who&#39;s the director? to which he replied Spielberg.&amp;nbsp;
Why was it released now? she asked.
I responded well, it didn&#39;t occur before the election so it can&#39;t be called a clear endorsement for an African&#45;American president, sort of &amp;quot;look how far we&#39;ve come since the 13th amendment&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; The boys listened.&amp;nbsp;
No, she commented, but it&#39;s certainly a good piece to have out in the aftermath of the Obamacare passage.&amp;nbsp; People want the big concepts like healthcare reform, but don&#39;t want to see all of the little deals that go into the passage of such legislation.&amp;nbsp; As the conversation meandered, we questioned whether Obamacare is actually something good.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s 1400 pages that almost no one has actually read and many are opposed to it, sometimes viscerally.&amp;nbsp; Yet the 13th amendment&#39;s passage was likewise opposed, sometimes viscerally and in the moment of it&#39;s passage, it required the courage and great effort of a minority to enact it.&amp;nbsp; The point to the boys was this:&amp;nbsp; all that you can have at that moment are your convictions and it won&#39;t necessarily be until sometime later that you learn whether the fruition of those convictions was truly successful.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot is this.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t presume that the schools are going to teach your children everything that they need to learn to survive in the great wide world.&amp;nbsp; Look for your opportunities to expand their horizons and think about what you want them to take from those opportunities.&amp;nbsp; Make it a point to ask them what they noticed or thought and then just chat with them.&amp;nbsp; There are moments when they cock their heads and give you that Laddie, the Wonder Spaniel look but there will also be moments when you can watch the lights being turned on in the rooms inside their head and it&#39;s those moments that provide profound satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t let them nag you out of it just because it might be out of their comfort zone; kids will bitch, whine and kvetch since that&#39;s what they do.&amp;nbsp; Suffer it and push them so that they experience something that&#39;s ultimately in their best interest and remember that since you&#39;re the parent, you should know better than they do what&#39;s in their best interest. &amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>60,000</title>
<body>Life happens.&amp;nbsp; Holidays come and go, kids return and then depart, cars are wrecked (no injuries, thank God), motherboards on laptops die, and certain milestones are reached.&amp;nbsp; This particular milestone is that the PracticalDad site readership surpassed 60,000 regular readers on the RSS feed.
The site began four years ago with a single intent and two simple parameters.&amp;nbsp; The intent was to write about fatherhood and family, showing that men could be as capable in parenting as women although it&#39;s morphed somewhat as I&#39;ve tried to explore how what&#39;s happening with society and economy affects our families.&amp;nbsp; The first parameter is that I not produce anything that would embarrass anyone within the family; not everything written has been posted as review and reflection caused me to delete articles because they might be embarrassing to one or more of the kids.&amp;nbsp; The great majority don&#39;t personally know Eldest, Middle or Youngest but a few readers do and the kids don&#39;t need a neighbor nodding the head and thinking &quot;so that&#39;s why he looked like he was having an aneurysm.&quot;&amp;nbsp; The second parameter is that I simply don&#39;t write crap.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s enough nonsense on the web and I don&#39;t need to add to it and again, several articles were simply deleted because they left an odor on the keyboard.
Thank you for reading the PracticalDad.&amp;nbsp; And please don&#39;t think badly if this note&#39;s format is odd because there&#39;s something squirrelly with how the new laptop&#39;s mouse interacts with the site&#39;s programming/writing module.&amp;nbsp; Life happens.</body>

<body>Today is a day that will be spent on errands and some shopping for the upcoming holidays and there&#39;s now an additional item on that list, a box of Twinkies.&amp;nbsp; They aren&#39;t something that I&#39;ve actually purchased before &#45; so I suppose that I&#39;m part of the reason for the Hostess Corporation demise &#45;&amp;nbsp; but the soon&#45;to&#45;be Hostess bankruptcy makes them an interesting household piece for discussion.&amp;nbsp;
The privately held corporation&#39;s bankruptcy has been an item for discussion in the past several days as the Teamsters union put the kabosh on the contract offered by Hostess management.&amp;nbsp; The interplay of news has been entertaining as one article&#39;s spin puts a negative light on the union&#39;s refusal to ratify the contract, killing the company, while another highlights that the existing management is going to still distribute more than $1.5 million in bonuses.&amp;nbsp; The lessons for the kids in the next several days could be far&#45;reaching and could go in any number of directions.

<title>Boyfriends (and Girlfriends)</title>
<body>You&#39;re gonna wanna put a bullet in your head when she finally brings home a boyfriend.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#45;&amp;nbsp; Friend of PracticalDad, 1994
This friend commented the above to me over lunch prior to Eldest&#39;s birth and it was funny in the moment, especially since his girl was 15 and my unborn&amp;nbsp;was seeming light years away from that point.&amp;nbsp; But time passes quicker than you realize and suddenly, she&#39;s talking about boys and soon there&#39;s some acne&#45;riddled, pubescent&amp;nbsp;bucket of testosterone staring you in the face.&amp;nbsp; Dear God, he was right...shoot me now.&amp;nbsp;
Whether it&#39;s a boyfriend or a son&#39;s girlfriend, how do you even begin to handle it?&amp;nbsp; The teen years are a time of massive change and that&#39;s the way that it should be, with the bodies growing and changing and the brains literally rewiring themselves during that period.&amp;nbsp; Part and parcel of that process is the development of sexuality, typically in the opposite gender but occasionally in the same.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of the orientation, there is so much for them to learn...most especially how to treat and interact with someone with whom they&#39;re interested.&amp;nbsp; So understand that it&#39;s coming and prepare yourself for the day, because it will arrive.
So what should you consider?&amp;nbsp; So much of how you respond will depend upon your own values; it&#39;s fine if you disagree with what I write, but accept it simply as a point of departure for your own conversations and decisions.
First, understand that the kids are a blank slate in most areas&amp;nbsp;and will learn from watching you, even when you&#39;re unaware of it.&amp;nbsp; Think about how you interact with your &amp;quot;significant other&amp;quot; on a daily basis.&amp;nbsp; As much as I hate using that term, the reality is that there are now ex&#45;wives and husbands, live&#45;in/unmarrieds, girlfriends and even boyfriends; regardless of the status, how do you treat that person and how do you display affection?&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t necessarily an overt decision and display, but understand that they will take their cues from you.&amp;nbsp; The flip side of this is that if they&#39;re allowed to spend hours each day in front of unsupervised television and computer, what they&#39;ll learn about sexuality and the treatment of others is going to vastly different from what you&#39;ll think is appropriate or warranted.&amp;nbsp; This is one of the primary reasons that we enforced the rules on electronics usage from an early age.
Second, understand that your child&#39;s definition of dating, boyfriend and girlfriend might be radically different from your own adult definition.&amp;nbsp; I was surprised one evening by Eldest, in her sixth grade year, when she asked at the dinner table if she could have a boyfriend.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fortunate that my wife took the lead and in the ensuing conversation, found that her definition was far more simplistic than I envisioned and it was innocent enough that I didn&#39;t have a stroke.&amp;nbsp; It also however, led to overt discussion about behaviors and further conversations about attitudes and morality.&amp;nbsp;
Third, is there a specific age at which you&#39;ll actually permit the child to actually go out with someone?&amp;nbsp; Eldest and Middle both had dating relationships at the age of 15, albeit with ground rules, fixed transportation arrangements and curfews.&amp;nbsp; But I spoke with another parent the other evening and they were adamant in not permitting their child to date until 17, noting that their principal responsibility during the earlier years was the schoolwork.&amp;nbsp; While I can respect that, part and parcel of the teen years is learning how to manage relationships.
Fourth, what are your expectations and your ground rules?&amp;nbsp; Be sure to communicate these clearly and explicitly to the kids, including the repercussions if these are broken.&amp;nbsp; In the PracticalDad household, no boyfriend or girlfriend can visit unless one of the adults is present and all doors must remain open; there is a clear understanding that we also have access to all areas of the house so that&amp;nbsp;we&#39;re free to come down to the basement mechanical room &#45; adjacent to the family room &#45; at any time.&amp;nbsp; There have been instances when I&#39;ve gone there simply to prove that I can.&amp;nbsp; What are the transportation arrangements?&amp;nbsp; Who has to be home and when, and how are they getting there?&amp;nbsp; There have been occasions when the teen relationships have taken a back seat to other business simply because plans weren&#39;t checked out with me in advance.&amp;nbsp; What are the guidelines &#45; if any &#45; on public displays of affection?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been a point here since we&#39;ve actively opened the household to the significant others but there&#39;s still a younger sibling&amp;nbsp;in elementary school and he doesn&#39;t need to be exposed to too much.&amp;nbsp; if we&#39;re going to control it on the screen, then we&#39;re going to control it here as well.
Fifth, how much do you want to include the significant others in family life?&amp;nbsp; Are there family events or evenings that are off&#45;limits to outsiders or are you willing to open them up?&amp;nbsp; One of the things that you should consider is that there are more than a few teens with no significant adult supervision or involvement in their lives and being inclusive not only allows you to keep a better eye on what&#39;s going on, it also allows them the opportunity to see the workings of an involved and active family.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t mean that your family is perfect, but it&#39;s a sad fact that at least you have an engaged family while these kids might not.&amp;nbsp; Accept it as a truism that kids coming from situations in which there isn&#39;t an active and engaged family will want to spend time with your own family; and the other truism is that you will in turn begin to care for them regardless of their status with your kid.&amp;nbsp; I know of situations in which the ex&#45;boyfriends and girlfriends continue to maintain contact even after their own relationship has ended.&amp;nbsp;
Many fathers aren&#39;t aware of the power of their own example until the kids are old enough to begin their own tentative relationships.&amp;nbsp; Understand now that the sons will see how you treat your mate and model that accordingly and your daughters will learn how they in turn should be treated.&amp;nbsp; There will always be disagreements and fights, but it&#39;s the manner in which they&#39;re handled that makes the difference.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>A Rolling Jubilee</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
If you think that Occupy Wall Street is dead and forgotten, then you might be interested to discover Rolling Jubilee.&amp;nbsp; This refers to a livestreamed concert event to raise money to purchase distressed debt and then &#45; in a true twist &#45; forgive it so that the debtors are left with a clean slate.&amp;nbsp; The term jubilee refers to the Old Testament biblical practice of a periodic forgiveness of debt across society so that all start again with a clean slate.&amp;nbsp;
Yes, you can purchase &amp;quot;distressed&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&#45; old &#45; debt and then pursue it for collection via legal means.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s frankly a lucrative venture but one so seamy that it&#39;s left to the vulture financial types because you&#39;re pursuing people who are truly down.&amp;nbsp; The lucrative nature of the practice stems upon the fact that the debt is purchased for pennies on the dollar to reflect the likelihood of full repayment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The seaminess is that you&#39;re dealing with people who typically have nothing and it&#39;s going to require real pressure to get anything back.&amp;nbsp;
There was a time years ago when I investigated its cousin, tax lien purchases, as an investment possibility; I subsequently wrote it off because it simply seemed morally repugnant to prey upon someone in such a circumstance.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to say that all debtors are victims since the taking on of debt often involves choice and free will, but we do live in a consumerist system in which the finanical sector has a largely free hand and that&#39;s especially the case in regards to debt collection.&amp;nbsp; The collectors don&#39;t care about the why and how, just the money.&amp;nbsp;
I know that I&#39;m around that evening and will probably stream it with at least one of the kids.&amp;nbsp; But even if I&#39;m not going to stream it, I will put my money where my mouth is and donate because some folks truly are victims and I&#39;m not comfortable letting them suffer for the sins of some of their peers.&amp;nbsp; My hope is that they in turn learn and adapt accordingly.
And all of that aside, I&#39;m going to continue to work to assure that my own kids have the knowledge and capacity to avoid that debt mess in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Because home is where it all begins.</body>

<title>Legalizing Marijuana:&nbsp; Told Ya So&#8230;</title>
<body>Just watch.&amp;nbsp; In a couple of years, states will begin legalizing marijuana and they&#39;re going to tax it for the revenues.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; PracticalDad to Eldest and Middle, 2009
Unfortunately, I&#39;m right.&amp;nbsp;Granted, these aren&#39;t the legislators of Colorado and Washington simply saying yep, we&#39;re broke so let&#39;s legalize and tax;&amp;nbsp;this is the result of public referendums brought about by marijuana activists.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps even as recently as five years ago, they might have been beaten back but we&#39;re now in the throes of the first real public realizations that all of the promises made to various constituencies are costlier than expected and that the money isn&#39;t there to support them.&amp;nbsp; These votes are the opening of a new front in the ongoing and growing fight about austerity, what we can &#45; and want to &#45; afford with our public dollars.
This budgetary impact was actually part and parcel of the approach crafted by the legalization proponents, particularly in&amp;nbsp;the state of Washington.&amp;nbsp; The proposal was that&amp;nbsp;there would be a 25% tax on marijuana with the money going to the state coffers, and I suspect that&amp;nbsp;it was a major&amp;nbsp;reason that it passed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;voters recognize that there are obligations, particularly for their own&amp;nbsp;favorite projects, but the tax revenues&amp;nbsp;won&#39;t support them without significant cuts.&amp;nbsp; Since&amp;nbsp;no one likes to cut&amp;nbsp;because it&#39;s going to hit&amp;nbsp;somebody somewhere, then the alternative is to find a new source of revenue&amp;nbsp;and dope has the potential to be a big source.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
But this isn&#39;t going to&amp;nbsp;succeed easily because of the opposition from the Federal government, which has sworn to oppose legalization in any state.&amp;nbsp; And while&amp;nbsp;it has partially to do with the welfare of the kids, a significant portion&amp;nbsp;also comes down to&amp;nbsp;money.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;We all know that money runs the government, both in terms of paying for the services rendered and the votes.&amp;nbsp; There are multiple lobbies that oppose marijuana&#39;s legalization for their own financial ends and have spent money as an investment to assure that it continues to remain illegal.&amp;nbsp; First and foremost of these is the lobby for the for&#45;profit private prisons, principally Corrections Corporation of America.&amp;nbsp; How extensive is the use of private prisons?&amp;nbsp; CCA was the first in 1983 and continues to be the principal player.&amp;nbsp; With an incarcerated population of 2.3 million people, private industry is responsible now for 130,000 prisoners, or about 8% of that population.&amp;nbsp; While it might not appear to be that large an amount and not worthy of concern, consider this:&amp;nbsp; while the private prison population rose by 37% from 2002 to 2009, the amount of money spent lobbying rose by more than 150%.&amp;nbsp; With the trend towards privatization continuing in the wake of the Reagan Revolution, incarceration is increasingly about revenue instead of rehabilitation and atonement.&amp;nbsp;
Along with the private prisons, there are other aspects of the legal system with a vested interest in continuing the prohibition of marijuana.&amp;nbsp; There are prison&amp;nbsp;guard unions, especially in California, with an interest since anything that continues to provide a constant supply of inmates and the accompanying revenue stream accrue to their benefit; with budgets on the cusp of real shrinkage so that the profit margin per inmate declines, there&#39;s an interest in increasing the volume of inmates in order to maximize the profit and payroll for the union members.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s also an interest for the legal enforcement community since the affected budgets mean that there&#39;s a greater need to obtain grants available for drug enforcement in&amp;nbsp;order to meet the payroll and keep the money flowing.&amp;nbsp;
In researching this article, I was surprised to see the strange bedfellows who went along with the legal community to oppose marijuana legalization.  Both the pharmaceutical and recreational alcohol lobbies&amp;nbsp;have ponied up money to oppose legalization; the former because of the concern about competition of pot with prescription medications and the latter because of simple competition with legalized recreational alcohol.&amp;nbsp; In California, the beer distribution lobby actually donated to defeat California Proposition 19, which would have legalized marijuana in that state.&amp;nbsp;
So the lines are being drawn as everybody takes a side to determine how the draining pot of resources is allocated to use.&amp;nbsp; Private monies will be spent and those without private funds will increasingly take to the hallways and streets to demonstrate for their own viewpoint.&amp;nbsp; As a parent, it will be my job to assess the viewpoints and then make the best decision on behalf of my kids.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I know how I was raised and the values with which I was inculcated.&amp;nbsp; The hard part will be take those views and assess in the cold, hard light of day to see if they still make sense.

<title>What Do We Owe Our Children?</title>
<body>What do&amp;nbsp;we owe&amp;nbsp;our children?&amp;nbsp;
Don&#39;t think that such a philosophic personal question has no bearing on the public issues.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s clear that&amp;nbsp;our nation cannot continue on the present course.&amp;nbsp; The power structure has shifted to the corporation and the wealthy few, who have successfully manipulated the political system to support economic and monetary policies that sacrifice the great majority to their own&amp;nbsp;benefit.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve failed to pay attention to our society and have succumbed to a consumerist mentality that has literally turned Aesop&#39;s Grasshopper and the Ant on its head.&amp;nbsp; Our late generation boomers have done such a poor job of savings that they&#39;re unable to retire in the classical sense and are unwilling to give up positions to the younger generation, who themselves are overladen with debt in their quest for the middle class.&amp;nbsp; As I&#39;ve said before, we have to renegotiate the social contracts amongst ourselves...but where to start?&amp;nbsp;
The only way to truly start the conversation is in the home.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What do I, as a father, owe my children?&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t an odd question because how we raise our children is crucial to their ability to cope with the changes that the country will have to endure in the coming decades.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s been a long, hard four decades for American fathers.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been gone from a significant number of our children&#39;s lives and frankly, it shows.&amp;nbsp; The rise of the divorce rate led to children being often given to the sole custody of the mothers with the father being marginalized.&amp;nbsp; The court system held to old beliefs that the children were best left to the care of the mothers, who were better parents by dint of simply being mothers; to be fair, the father before the 1970s usually did have little experience with the kids and would have been completely at sea, at least for the beginning.&amp;nbsp; But the presumption held that fathers were automatically worse parents by dint of simply being fathers.&amp;nbsp; The perversities of the old welfare system, in which women received additional government stipends to support more children, led to the growth of inner&#45;city populations in which the presence of a father became the rare exception and not the rule.&amp;nbsp; These two roads led to the almost complete marginalization of the American father, a punch&#45;line in any number of popular situation comedies such as Married With Children, The Simpsons and Family Guy.&amp;nbsp; There were certainly other shows, such as Cosby, but the damage was done as it&#39;s easier to tear down than to build up.&amp;nbsp;
But long struggles by fathers through the years are turning the tides.&amp;nbsp; Court systems no longer automatically rule on behalf of the mother and I personally know of situations in which the fathers are suing for full custody of the kids, having patiently documented and worked to show that they were decent parents.&amp;nbsp; There is organized recognition by fatherless men that they themselves suffered for lack of a father and wanting to assure that it doesn&#39;t occur with their own children.&amp;nbsp; The media is now portraying men &#45; in commercials and on television &#45; as equally capable parents, albeit with a different perspective than traditional motherhood.&amp;nbsp; Jimmy Fallon&#39;s sitcom, Guys With Kids, is a prime example of men &#45; each in a different marital status &#45; making their children a primary focus in their lives and making fatherhood work.&amp;nbsp;
As we reconsider our mutual obligations, what do we &#45; fathers &#45; owe our children?

    More than anything else, we owe them our time.&amp;nbsp; The economy is changing as we watch; while the unemployment rate is down, the jobs that are being created are mostly part&#45;time and without benefits so that longer hours and more jobs are required in order to keep the family income afloat.&amp;nbsp; Families will find, even as they cut and adjust their spending, that they&#39;re going to be working longer hours.&amp;nbsp; Both parents will be stretched and fathers will have to step up to greater levels in sharing the household and childcare duties.&amp;nbsp; But childcare is more than simply cleaning and feeding; childcare involves reading to and playing with them, overseeing studies and monitoring their friendships and play.&amp;nbsp; This means that there&#39;s simply going to be less time available for fathers to spend on themselves, something that our forebear fathers were loathe to do without.&amp;nbsp; This is a return to the first principle of fatherhood, that your life is truly no longer your own.&amp;nbsp;
    We owe them our conversation.&amp;nbsp; The stereotype of Dad behind the morning newspaper is old and frankly, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s even operative anymore.&amp;nbsp; But Dad has to have a vibrant and engaged voice in the daily conversation with the kids.&amp;nbsp; This is especially important as we&#39;ve realized that the kids are now spending more than 6 hours each day nestled in an electronic cocoon, without benefit of a parent who can help bring order and context to all of the imagery that&#39;s presented to them.&amp;nbsp; The children are literally bombarded with imagery and sound and it often comes in rapid waves.&amp;nbsp; One of our jobs is to enforce some discipline on the electronics and then talk with them about what&#39;s happening around them to bring context to their world.
    We owe them a respect for their mother, even if we&#39;re divorced.&amp;nbsp; Children love both of their parents and desperately want to know that even if they&#39;re not together, they can pull together for them.&amp;nbsp; They neither deserve nor want to be caught in the middle of squabbling parents and we&#39;ve witnessed the angst and distress of kids who are caught amidst dueling parents.&amp;nbsp; I was driving with Youngest last week and the conversation turned to several&amp;nbsp;of his friends, all of whom have parents separated or divorced; he remarked that if we broke up, he hoped that we would behave like one particular friend whose parents were civil and actively worked to maintain a decent relationship for the boy&#39;s benefit.&amp;nbsp; It was frankly startling.&amp;nbsp; So even if you think that she&#39;s a screaming banshee and she sees you as the devil incarnate, you&#39;re going to have to find a way if at all possible to keep an even keel.&amp;nbsp; In other words, if there&#39;s nothing nice to say, say nothing at all.
    We owe them our support.&amp;nbsp; This is more than just time because supporting them means that we&#39;re also going to have to leave our comfort zones and learn about what they enjoy as they experience new things.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a case in point as I&#39;ve had to learn how to keep the basketball and baseball score books and scoreboard, and am learning the basics of the garage band on the fly; I have no experience in any of these things but if it&#39;s reasonable, respectable and enjoyable, then they should be supported as they explore their interests.
    We owe them our adulthood.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been a tendency in the past several decades for parents to want to be friends instead of parents, people who have to say no, maintain discipline and administer punishment and trust me, it can be contentious and unpleasant.&amp;nbsp; The kids have to understand that there is a hierarchy and that someone is able to make decisions devoid of the angst and drama that frequently accompanies the teen years.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, someone has to take the long&#45;term view and that&#39;s something about which most teens are simply incapable due to the inexperience and the still turbulent hormones that drive much teen decision&#45;making.
    We don&#39;t owe them guilt for not being able to give them what they want.&amp;nbsp; As incomes decline and families rejigger to meet their needs, parents simply won&#39;t be able to provide all of the accessories that are peddled and that might have been afforded in the past.&amp;nbsp; Kids can learn to do without and it&#39;s frankly important that they do so, that they learn to differentiate between need and want; it&#39;s a distinction that&#39;s actively blurred by the corporations that peddle their wares.&amp;nbsp; Consider this however:&amp;nbsp; if you don&#39;t give them the latest version of iPod or the Xbox but instead make a concerted effort to spend more time with them and interacting with them, you&#39;ll instead be giving them the paternal involvement that you yourself might never have had.&amp;nbsp;

It&#39;s possible that if you think about it, you&#39;ll have your own criteria of what you owe your children.&amp;nbsp; The point however, is to actively think and define what you should do.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s at least half of the fight and a good headstart for the kids.&amp;nbsp; Then the trick will be to honor them to the best of ability.

<title>Politics and Cynicism</title>
<body>As a father, I&#39;m supposed to be respectful of our institutions and try to teach the theory of why things are the way that they are.&amp;nbsp; Yet I still try to raise the kids to be skeptical and not believe everything that they hear and there are times when it&#39;s damned near impossible to find the balance.&amp;nbsp; The last two weeks of this 2012 presidential campaign are an example of those times.
There&#39;s obviously a great deal riding on the outcome and I agree that this is an election with a meaning.&amp;nbsp; The country is in need of true change beyond what is typically seen in a change of political parties, even when there was a real difference between them.&amp;nbsp; The debt situation &#45; personal, student, governmental &#45; cannot continue and the powers that be have to learn that you can&#39;t solve what is fundamentally a solvency issue by issuing still more debt.&amp;nbsp; The social contracts amongst our citizenry have to be fundamentally rewritten.&amp;nbsp; What do we owe our elderly and what fair claim do they have upon the national resources?&amp;nbsp; What do we owe our young people so that they have a real chance to pursue happiness, unencumbered by debt?&amp;nbsp; What must we do to truly rebuild our educational system so that it meets the needs of the individual and society?&amp;nbsp; One of the exercises in Middle&#39;s Honors Civics class was a web&#45;based internet exercise in which the students had to balance the federal budget.&amp;nbsp; His response one evening was that we&#39;re screwed because if you make the cuts, people hate you and if you don&#39;t, the debt blows up.&amp;nbsp; It was an eye&#45;opening experience for him.&amp;nbsp;
There have been conversations with Middle and Youngest &#45; Eldest is away at college &#45; about the system and the election.&amp;nbsp; Middle&#39;s Civics&amp;nbsp;teacher has done a good job of exposing them to current issues as well as the traditional aspects.&amp;nbsp; One evening&#39;s conversation was about campaign finance and I was surprised that he knew about SuperPACs and the issue of soft money spending on advertising.&amp;nbsp; On a truly family level perspective, the spate of last minute get out the vote calls has been unprecedented, to the point that I&#39;ve actually disconnected the telephone and one person to whom I spoke today noted on her Facebook page that any friends who wished to contact her would have to do so by cellphone over the weekend.&amp;nbsp; Much of this is funded by soft money.&amp;nbsp; The calls have been so annoying that I&#39;ve actually taken the time of pollsters and proceeded to lie through my teeth so as to get a little revenge for this nonsense and I&#39;ve admitted such to the kids.&amp;nbsp;
The other aspects that have come up persistently here relate to the parties and the candidates, particularly that there are no true differences between them.&amp;nbsp; Despite all of the talk about policies, they might as well combine them and name the resulting creature Rombama.&amp;nbsp; Despite the taped endorsement from Colin Powell in which he states that the financial system has stabilized and recovered, the reality is that the financial system has become a cause of the zombification of the remainder of the real economy and a principal contributor to the monetary policies that grotesquely pull demand forward and penalize savers.&amp;nbsp; If our forefathers could see what our leaders are permitting, they&#39;d literally stick a foot up their collective ass.&amp;nbsp; While the system was truly at the point of collapse in 2008, Obama should have made true reformation of the financial system the first priority instead of pursuing Obamacare; he instead proved to be a tool of the financial leaders.&amp;nbsp; His candidate counterpart simply lost me with his comment that corporations are people, too.&amp;nbsp; He can talk as much as he wants about cutting taxes and balancing the budget but he has to be substantive as to how he&#39;ll handle spending.&amp;nbsp; If a teenager can take a computer exercise and see how totally screwed up things are, then I&#39;m not hopeful at the soundbite hoopla.
That simple comment is the crux of the problem facing our country today, the rise of the corporations and their power in the face of the individual.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not raising my children to be consumers and that is precisely what the system&#39;s leaders want.
Tomorrow, I&#39;ll do my duty and vote and because the elementary schools are closed to serve as polling places, I&#39;ll take Youngest along with me.&amp;nbsp; He can hold my nose for me.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; November 2012 Continues the Rise</title>
<body>The November 2012 market basket of 47 items was priced and the results show increases in both the Total Index (all 47 items) and the Food&#45;only (the 37 food items in the basket) Index.&amp;nbsp; Note for both indices that November 2010 = 100.&amp;nbsp; The difference between the Total and Food&#45;only indices are that the Food&#45;only shows the price activity of only the actual food items within the marketbasket with the non&#45;food items removed (foil, soap, trash bags, diapers, etc.).

The Total Index is up from October&#39;s level but still not back at the previous index high of 107.50, hit in September 2012.&amp;nbsp; Unlike that however, the Food&#45;only Index never faltered and has once again hit an all&#45;time high of 113.04.&amp;nbsp; What that literally means is that the cost of the same 37 food items in the market basket are now 13.04% higher than at the Index&#39;s inception in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; To see a complete roster of the items in the basket, see here.&amp;nbsp;
The column entitled &amp;quot;Spread&amp;quot; refers to the difference between the two indices and is an indicator of the rate at which food prices are advancing ahead of all prices, which include non&#45;food items as well.&amp;nbsp; Given the small number of non&#45;food items in the basket, it would be considered statistically invalid.&amp;nbsp; But on a gut, common&#45;sense level, it does provide some insight into how the price of food is behaving in relation to other prices in the current economic and monetary environment.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Who Should Pay for Higher Education?</title>
<body>Here&#39;s the question:&amp;nbsp; who should pay for a kid&#39;s higher education?
The default answer &#45; the public &#45;&amp;nbsp;is well&#45;settled at the elementary and secondary levels as each local school district is empowered to levy property taxes to pay for school.&amp;nbsp; The practice was allowed under the philosophy that it was in the public interest to educate the youngsters so that they could take a functioning role in society and not be a burden.&amp;nbsp; Some may argue about the technicalities &#45; whether they were trained to be cogs in an industrial state and etc &#45; but the premise remains, that they should have a basic level of knowledge in order to survive.&amp;nbsp; But what happens&amp;nbsp;after they reach an educational level at which they supposedly have the requisite tools and skills to support themselves?&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t an effort to take any particular stance &#45; I&#39;m still uncertain in my own mind &#45; but is rather an attempt to help myself work through the issues.
The first issue is, what exactly is the point of a higher education?&amp;nbsp; If tens of thousands of dollars are spent on a degree, shouldn&#39;t you be certain why you&#39;re spending it?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a fascinating chart in Time Magazine&#39;s article on college, College is Dead, Long Live College, that fundamentally displays the disconnect between the educational establishment and the general public.&amp;nbsp; A poll was taken of adults in the general population and college leaders asking each what is the most important reason to go to college?&amp;nbsp; The responses are startling in their disconnect and awareness of what&#39;s occurring in our society.&amp;nbsp; Fully 54% of the general population adults believe that the two principal functions of college are to gain skills/knowledge for a career and increase earnings power.&amp;nbsp; Fully 55% of the college leaders believe that the primary reasons for college are to learn to think critically and to become an informed citizen in a global society (although to be fair, 21% of the college establishment believes that earnings is a primary role as well).&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, there is a massive disconnect between the product designed by the establishment and the product desired by the populace, yet the populace is being forced to purchase the product by their employer.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s akin to knowing that you need a minivan for two kids but have to pay for a convertible because your employer mandates it.&amp;nbsp; So what if it doesn&#39;t work for you, buy it or else find a new job.
The notion of teaching critical thinking itself demonstrates that the college establishment is out of touch with the reality of today&#39;s millenial generation.&amp;nbsp; While critical thinking is crucial to real success, let alone an appreciation of&amp;nbsp;what life can offer, it&#39;s become a lost art for many high school students and graduates.&amp;nbsp; Critical thinking requires a sustained effort at questioning and then evaluating the information to determine what&#39;s actually happening.&amp;nbsp; It also involves a willingness to learn about the world around you and&amp;nbsp;explore connections between seemingly disparate elements to get to the true reality, not just the virtual.&amp;nbsp; But the educational establishment is finding that the capacity to think critically amongst this generation is lacking; the article references Academically Adrift, which reported research showing that three full semesters of college had &amp;quot;...a &amp;quot;barely noticeable&amp;quot; impact on critical thinking, complex reasoning and writing skills...&amp;quot;(per Time).&amp;nbsp; As Jethro Gibbs would say, gee, ya think DiNozzo?&amp;nbsp; Starting decades ago, we parents began to permit our children an increasing amount of time on screens of one kind or another until today&#39;s level at which the average teen spends more than six hours daily immersed in electronics.&amp;nbsp; MTV, Youtube, Facebook and other forms of social media distract them from the real world and the constant flow of imagery and gab lends nothing to the development of critical thought.&amp;nbsp; If you want an eye&#45;opening view of the world at least partially inhabited by many high school and college&#45;aged kids, try reading Texts From Last Night&amp;nbsp;for a glimpse that&#39;s simultaneously hilarious, mind&#45;bending and ultimately depressing.&amp;nbsp; American society today is predicated upon avoiding any critical thought whatsoever, so good luck to the college establishment.
The second issue is the sea change in&amp;nbsp;our attitudes towards the&amp;nbsp;role of government since&amp;nbsp;Reagan&#39;s&amp;nbsp;(in)famous comment that &amp;quot;government is the problem, not the solution.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; That&amp;nbsp;comment&amp;nbsp;encapsulates&amp;nbsp;the entire pendulum swing that&#39;s moved towards privatization of many formerly public services, including the prison system and now education.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Even though a significant portion of the population was never able to attend college until the mid&amp;nbsp;to latter twentieth century,&amp;nbsp;our nation deemed education to be of value; we&amp;nbsp;passed legislation that permitted&amp;nbsp;the creation of colleges and universities &#45; in the midst of the civil war&amp;nbsp;&#45; and then greased the skids to higher education for the masses with the passage of the GI Bill.&amp;nbsp; This belief in the practical and moral value of education led to increased spending through the &amp;quot;golden age&amp;quot; of the American economy, before the onset of these present structural changes.&amp;nbsp; But Reagan&#39;s efforts, like those of his fans such as Limbaugh and Hannity, have kept proponents of the public sector on the defensive since then.&amp;nbsp; What is the value of government and what is the role of government?&amp;nbsp; Apart from defense &#45; and with private security like Blackwater, even that &#45; what do we need the government for when&amp;nbsp;the private sector can handle things nicely?&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s been that way with higher education as states attempt desperately to balance their budgets.&amp;nbsp; With ongoing commentary about wasteful spending and the need for individuals to take care of themselves, the politicians have taken a goodly share of funds from education, leaving it to the students and families to make up the difference.&amp;nbsp;
Apart from decreasing funding for public education, the private sector has also moved into education in a major way with the creation of for&#45;profit universities and on one level, that&#39;s fine.&amp;nbsp; But why do they believe that they can make money at all when there are so many other institutions of higher learning?&amp;nbsp; If you look at the majority of the degree programs offered by the for&#45;profits, they&#39;ve read the cards well and moved nimbly into the skills areas for which they perceive demand, such as electronics, less technical health care training and of course, law enforcement certification programs.&amp;nbsp; There are two year programs galore that meet the population&#39;s push for jobs&#45;related education.&amp;nbsp; But one of the other reasons that the for&#45;profits have gained ground has been the availability of relatively lower interest student loans through the past decade, courtesy of the federal government.&amp;nbsp; With flush times, the money was available for education and the for&#45;profits &#45; Phoenix, Kaplan, etc &#45; readily sold their programs to an increasingly larger number of people.&amp;nbsp; But the rear&#45;view mirror shows something else.&amp;nbsp; The completion rate of the for&#45;profits lagged far behind that of the non&#45;profit institutions, only 32% versus 55% for all institutions, as far more students leave with unfinished degrees than their non&#45;profit counterparts.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, there have been significant fines for student recruitment practices as bonuses for admissions counselors were akin to the commissions for shady mortgage brokers who were paid for the number of loans that they were able to write.&amp;nbsp; So once again, the availability of cheap money coupled with minimal oversight led to a corrupted educational process that served few well.
The third issue is that more than a few parents have done as little critical thinking as their offspring.&amp;nbsp; Folks likewise bought into the past several decades of consumerist behavior and again, fueled by cheap money and a persistent barrage to consume, found themselves suddenly unprepared for the loss of living wage jobs for themselves, let alone their kids.&amp;nbsp; Hearing the data trumpeted again and again that the degree was the entry to the new &amp;quot;knowledge based economy&amp;quot; &#45; honestly, what economy isn&#39;t? &#45; they simply panicked and pushed the kids through the institutions while piling on the debt for themselves and then, the kids.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s now apparent that the adults are unprepared for any meaningful retirement and are increasingly being pushed to no&#45;benefit part&#45;time employment; even when the opportunity existed to save for college, it didn&#39;t happen and it&#39;s now, for the larger part, too late. &amp;nbsp;
So how do we recreate or rejigger the system so that it again works?&amp;nbsp; There are obviously no easy, one&#45;size fits all solutions.&amp;nbsp; The macro solutions are about reordering our priorities and determining where we place both them and our money.&amp;nbsp; What do we owe our youngsters and in turn, what are our expectations of them?&amp;nbsp; I do believe that another aspect is that if government is going to be involved in the higher education process, then it has to do more than provide loans which have proven to create moral hazards.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve decided, in more truly dire circumstances, to support education and I see no reason that we shouldn&#39;t reverse ourselves and put our backing there again.&amp;nbsp;
On a personal level then, parents have to step up in a non&#45;financial sense.&amp;nbsp; The present reality is that traditional higher education is increasingly beyond the means of many American families.&amp;nbsp; But there should be no reason that a kid should say that she didn&#39;t know what it would cost to repay the loans or that she couldn&#39;t find meaningful employment with a Western Civ degree and it&#39;s up to us as parents to impart that information.&amp;nbsp; We must pay greater attention to the world around us and plan and act accordingly.&amp;nbsp; We must pay greater attention to our children and help them ascertain their skills and talents in a meaningful fashion.&amp;nbsp; We must be willing to help teach them think critically, first and foremost by kicking their butts off of the electronics and back into the real world, even if it means that we lose more of our own increasingly rare free time.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Helicoptering the Kids with School Software</title>
<body>Education is certainly different today from what I knew, and that&#39;s especially in terms of the technology.&amp;nbsp; Elementary classrooms have Macs, the middle schoolers have classes in using&amp;nbsp;programs like Word and interested high schoolers can learn how to use Flash animation; most of the local high school classrooms now use Smartboards&amp;nbsp;that are frankly light years ahead of what I had.&amp;nbsp; But the schools &#45; locally, the middle and high schools &#45; also now have online programs that allow you to access all of Junior&#39;s grades on a real time basis; at the middle school level, when the kids are literally the walking dead, there&#39;s also a program to keep the parents up to date on the daily assignments.&amp;nbsp; But how often and to what extent should I utilize them?
The grades program is entitled Sapphire, a product of K12 Systems, an educational software firm.&amp;nbsp; The package is comprehensive for the using district; teachers can enter grades and make comments on the system; students and parents can check their grades as often as they wish and even the school nurse has a tracking module.&amp;nbsp; From the time that Eldest entered middle school &#45; and she&#39;s now a college freshman &#45; the parents were advised to check Sapphire regularly in order to know how the kids are doing.&amp;nbsp; Depending upon the adminstrator or teacher, the advice was to do so daily.&amp;nbsp; Parents were likewise told at the outset of middle school to regularly keep tabs on the daily homework assignments&amp;nbsp;via Moodle, a separate package upon which teacers can handle online quizzes and homework assignments, not to mention a readily available platform upon which to list the present assignments and projects due.&amp;nbsp; Depending&amp;nbsp;upon the teacher and grade level, Moodle can even be used as a teaching&amp;nbsp;platform for assignments in&amp;nbsp;elementary school; I was surprised to find that Youngest was recently doing&amp;nbsp;an extra credit quiz on Moodle over the past weekend.
There are certainly advantages to Moodle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While I&#39;m uncertain as&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;package cost of the platform for the district, it certainly&amp;nbsp;fits in well as a worthwhile investment despite the austerity that&#39;s continuing to work through the local school systems.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s less need&amp;nbsp;for the use of paper&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;the waste that especially hits the younger kids homework sheets are mangled&amp;nbsp;or lost either enroute to or from the home.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;nbsp;has likewise cut down&amp;nbsp;on the cost of&amp;nbsp;the planners that many schools have handed out to students at the onset of the new school year.&amp;nbsp; Our&amp;nbsp;local district has&amp;nbsp;given each student a planner for years but the quality and size of the planner has diminished considerably in the past two years as this line item&amp;nbsp;has fallen to the budget necessities.&amp;nbsp; Parents&amp;nbsp;can&amp;nbsp;continue to check the provided planner, especially for the younger students, but Youngest&#39;s teacher actually suggested that the parents provide a larger planner for use.&amp;nbsp; In the local district, Moodle is especially effective for the middle school parents as this is how the teachers post homework assignments and projects for the students; it&#39;s at this age that the child&#39;s ability to organize and think clearly is particularly hard hit.&amp;nbsp; By the time that the kids hit high school however, that aspect of Moodle is finished and it really is up to the student&#39;s ability to keep and maintain a planner...and the parent&#39;s ability to keep up with that as well.
But if our job is to raise them and prepare them to make their way in the world, does this technology ultimately help or hinder?&amp;nbsp; For all of the school system&#39;s commentary about the need to keep tabs, what sank in for me came from a high school math teacher with teens of her own.&amp;nbsp; As a parent, she only touched base in the system herself but once every two weeks; how were the kids doing and what were there any issues that seemed to be cropping up, such as recurrent missed homework?&amp;nbsp; As we spoke, her thinking mirrored mine &#45; and I felt like a terrible parent because I wasn&#39;t checking every night &#45; in that the kids weren&#39;t really learning consequences if they weren&#39;t allowed to screw up (as kids and teens can do in such combustibly magnificent fashion).&amp;nbsp; Gee, you got a D because the homework wasn&#39;t turned in...there goes that particular privilege.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the kids gain a sense that the &#39;rents will also be there to backstop them and they don&#39;t pay attention to the time management and organizational skills that life requires.&amp;nbsp; On a personal level, my own kids hate Sapphire and Moodle because it creates &#45; for them &#45; a sense that they have no independence and are forever tied to the apron.&amp;nbsp; In a small way for them, it retards their belief that they&#39;re moving onwards to adulthood&amp;nbsp;and still require constant supervision.
There&#39;s no tried and true approach to the technology since no two children are alike.&amp;nbsp; In this household, one teen&#39;s ability to organize and manage work meant that&amp;nbsp;these were rarely utilized while a sibling&#39;s lack of structure led to greater use (and bloodshed).&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s taken time to reach a balance so that the child doesn&#39;t feel as though independence is retarded while I&#39;m comfortable with what&#39;s going on with the schoolwork.&amp;nbsp; There have been repeated conversations about expectations and consequences and this child seems to understand that if the performance &#45; matching the abilities &#45; isn&#39;t there, then privileges will disappear and consequences will occur.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to adulthood.

<title>Becoming Good (Post-)Consumers</title>
<body>The conversation has nagged at me for a week now.&amp;nbsp; I was speaking with a mother who was also a high school English teacher and we chatted about teens and teaching.&amp;nbsp; As we spoke, she looked at me and commented that where we were failing was in preparing the kids for the practical aspects of life, such as keeping a checkbook and managing personal finance; she&#39;s entirely correct in her assessment.&amp;nbsp; But she followed with another comment, that we aren&#39;t preparing them to be good consumers.&amp;nbsp; It was shortly afterwards that the conversation fell victim to the press of dealing with our elementary school boys, but that particular comment has come back to me repeatedly since then.&amp;nbsp;
We aren&#39;t preparing them to be good consumers?&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, we&#39;ve raised them to be great consumers.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re doing a lousy job of being good post&#45;consumers.&amp;nbsp;
I understand the point that she was making in the context of the talk about personal finance.&amp;nbsp; Our kids generally have a poor understanding of money and how to handle it, a function of&amp;nbsp;society&#39;s and parental inattention, as well as a purposeful effort to encourage consumerism.&amp;nbsp; How well do we live within our budget, save, keep track of our expenditures?&amp;nbsp; How do we maximize our money so that we&#39;re being the most efficient and effective with the funds that we have available?&amp;nbsp; But the choice of the word consumer, while not meaning that that&#39;s all that we are, is telling.&amp;nbsp; We should teach our children how to be consumers...
Shopping has become the manner of soothing our angst and alleviating our fears.&amp;nbsp; George W. Bush completely lost me in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks when he stated that we shouldn&#39;t let ourselves be held hostage to terror, but that we should go out and shop despite the fear.&amp;nbsp; Seriously?&amp;nbsp; When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping?&amp;nbsp; Some will say that it was just a poor choice of language, that shopping was a simple word denoting a wider spectrum of popular activities.&amp;nbsp; But&amp;nbsp;I recall&amp;nbsp;no language about overt public sacrifice, about what we needed as a nation to give up to pull together in common cause for what occurred and that is telling.&amp;nbsp; Where is the language about our collective values?
My sense is that we&#39;ve fully given over to the material consumer programming pushed by the corporations, media and government to the exclusion of the non&#45;material for life satisfaction.&amp;nbsp; To consider this, let&#39;s look at QVC and religious affiliation as proxies&amp;nbsp;for material and non&#45;material satisfaction respectively.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;QVC began as a fledgling entrepreneurial effort in 1986, two years after the start of HSN; in the earlier years, before and after it overtook the older HSN, it enjoyed growth of over 12%.&amp;nbsp; By the first decade of this century, growth had dropped to the single digits and in 2011, corporate revenues rose about 6.4% from 2010.&amp;nbsp; When you look at the QVC&amp;nbsp;on&#45;line age demographics, the largest segment is the boomer generation cohort of 55 &#45; 64 years of age.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s followed by the 65 and over group and then by the second boomer cohort of 45 &#45;54 year&#45;olds.&amp;nbsp; The first and third age cohorts are the boomer generation in almost entirety, a generation nursed on the earliest precepts of consumerism, delivered via television and a truly flush economy.&amp;nbsp; The 65 and overs are perhaps the last wealthy generation that we&#39;re going to be seeing, a group that does recall the lean years of the Great Depression and Second World War.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t forget that the retirement assets of the boomers aren&#39;t where they should be, particularly for the younger boomers.
On the other side of the ledger, take a look at religious affiliation, as recently viewed by Pew Research.&amp;nbsp; Remember that this is a proxy for non&#45;material values and not necessarily a cry that you had better get thee hence to a church.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s notable in the survey is that the percentage of Americans who have no affiliation to any particular religion or denomination rose to fully 20% of the population; the group taking the biggest hit was the staid mainline denominations (Lutheran, Methodist and the like) cohort.&amp;nbsp; But the telling story is again within the age groupings.&amp;nbsp; About 37% of the respondents within the 30 &#45; 49 year&#45;old cohort had no religious affiliation; 35% of the respondents in the&amp;nbsp; 18 &#45; 29 year&#45;old cluster had no affiliation either.&amp;nbsp; In comparing the two proxies, it would appear that the parents &#45; the&amp;nbsp;two largest QVC cohorts &#45; were buying into the push for a consumer mentality and letting it overtake the other values historically handed down within the family.&amp;nbsp; It hasn&#39;t been put to the statistical test, but it does make a certain sense.
The difficulty&amp;nbsp;for our children&amp;nbsp;however, is that the American consumer model is now dying.&amp;nbsp; Family incomes are dropping &#45; by approximately $3000 since the start of the Obama Administration &#45; and there&#39;s a record number of Americans now receiving food stamps.&amp;nbsp; You can argue that the &amp;quot;improvement&amp;quot; since the financial crisis of 2008 is purely a result of repeated episodes of Quantitiative Easing with the Federal Reserve tossing cash into the system like confetti at Mardi Gras.&amp;nbsp; Many living wage jobs have been shipped overseas and will only come home with lower labor costs, meaning less money for our families, who are still working on the consumption model.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re simply now at the point at which we have to learn &#45; and teach&amp;nbsp;our children &#45; that the easy personal financial choices of the past six decades are an end.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve now officially entered the Post&#45;Consumer era of American History, when the choices are harder and the opportunities fewer.&amp;nbsp; If you have any question about the validity of that statement, consider QVC once again.&amp;nbsp; In March of 2012, QVC inked an agreement with China&#39;s national radio broadcasting group to begin a joint venture into tapping into China&#39;s burgeoning middle class as occurred here.&amp;nbsp; The sights are likewise set on Brazil and India, two more members&amp;nbsp;of the so&#45;called BRIC group of nations, as&amp;nbsp;QVC joins the rest of the corporate flock&amp;nbsp;moving on to greener pastures after eating the local fields to the financial roots.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s an awareness that our kids don&#39;t have a handle on personal financial management, and that&#39;s true.&amp;nbsp; But looking at that technical side &#45; the use of credit and balancing a checkbook &#45; is missing the greater point.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s akin to saying that we need to teach the youngsters better ways to manufacture buggy whips when every Tom, Dick and Harry is setting up an automobile manufacturing company.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s time to recognize where we are and move on accordingly.</body>

<title>Cognitive Dissonance and Shopping</title>
<body>If we&#39;re going to slowly dig our way out of our collective economic hole, we&#39;re going to have to make fundamental changes in our spending patterns, one of the principal aspects being a concentrated effort to buy local.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Local&amp;quot; is a general geographic term, definable by the type of product being sold and it&#39;s origin of manufacture.&amp;nbsp; But the more is better meme has become so entrenched in the national psyche that acting contrary to the meme can create significant internal conflict and cognitive dissonance.&amp;nbsp; It might seem easy, but breaking the consumer programming can be harder than it appears and will take a conscious effort; I experienced the&amp;nbsp;discomfort with a recent purchase for an upcoming child&#39;s birthday.
Middle is in his mid&#45;teens and at a stage in which he&#39;s now aware of his appearance.&amp;nbsp; That however, is butting against the fact that he&#39;s probably not yet finished growing and I know that he&#39;d like at least one more spurt so that he&#39;s officially taller than his old man.&amp;nbsp; He recently asked for clothing for his upcoming birthday and the reality is that what he had last winter is going to be too short when he pulls it out for this winter.&amp;nbsp; Knowing that the article&amp;nbsp;&#45; he hasn&#39;t had the birthday yet and I know that at least one of his friends reads this for some odd reason &#45; isn&#39;t going to be cheap, I began to shop accordingly.&amp;nbsp; My intent was to purchase the desired item, but one that was made in this country.&amp;nbsp; As I went shopping however, it became apparent that anything sold in any of the department stores was manufactured overseas, even if the headquarters were domiciled domestically.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s be frank, the goal is to push money to the worker and not to the management.&amp;nbsp; The next step was to shift to the internet, via UPromise.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t a marketing shill, but if money is going to be spent online, I&#39;d rather see a small segment come back to the college savings accounts.&amp;nbsp; What I learned however, was that the article is available from domestic manufacturers but at much &#45; in this instance, twice as &#45; greater prices.&amp;nbsp; Clothes shopping isn&#39;t well&#45;suited to the internet and with all of the major retail outlets pushing foreign&#45;made brands, I suspect that there isn&#39;t sufficient demand to allow the higher labor costs to be offset by higher volume sales.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot was the classic putting your money where your mouth is scenario.&amp;nbsp; There is a general amount that can be spent for the birthday and honestly, purchasing the domestic article would handily blow that budget out of the water.&amp;nbsp; As it is, the foreign made article available at the department store also pushes the budget but allows for the purchase of one or two smaller items.&amp;nbsp; As I stewed on the decision, the constantly reinforced more is better meme smacked me in the mental head and led to true cognitive dissonance:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;birthday satisfaction&amp;nbsp;or common good?&amp;nbsp;
With the end of the Second World War, there was a conscious&amp;nbsp;decision by American business and the government to push much greater rates of consumer spending.&amp;nbsp; Both parties remembered how business spending collapsed during the Great Depression; that was replaced by the new Keynesian philosophy of pushing government spending, which Roosevelt embraced in his first two terms in office.&amp;nbsp; But government spending exploded during the Second World War, driving business investment and spending and allowing the American economy to again reach full employment.&amp;nbsp; The Axis&#39; defeat, and subsequent military downsizing, did leave the question of what would happen to the economy as government leaders believed in that quaint notion that the government&#39;s budget had to be balanced.&amp;nbsp; The drop in defense spending did lead to a recession just as millions of American men came home...what &#45; or who &#45; would take it&#39;s place?&amp;nbsp; Picture three players at a card table and two of them were working in tandem with a common strategy.&amp;nbsp; As the old axiom goes, if you&#39;re at the table and don&#39;t know who the sucker is, it&#39;s you.&amp;nbsp; That third player was the American consumer, who wanted a better future after two decades of economic collapse and global war.&amp;nbsp;
Pent up demand was fed by the new instruments of television advertising and the soon&#45;to&#45;be created credit card and the horses were out of the gate.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t believe that the government was complicit with the business community, just look at all of the tax deductions available in the IRS tax code.&amp;nbsp; While everyone talks about the tax&#45;deductibility of student debt and mortgage interest, most have forgotten that until its repeal in Reagan&#39;s 1986 Income Tax Revision Plan, the average person could also deduct their credit card interest payments from their federal income taxes.&amp;nbsp; It was during the early 1980s that the government decided it needed the tax revenue more than the public policy goal of building a consumerist society and the deduction ended; the consumer mentality train was happily rolling onwards.
But while the train was speeding down the tracks at this time, foreign competition increased.&amp;nbsp; Remember how the Japanese were going to rule the world?&amp;nbsp; American corporations were losing market share and profit margin and corporations began to address at least the latter by shifting their production overseas.&amp;nbsp; Textiles left the south, shoes left New England and autos departed from Detroit.&amp;nbsp; If Americans wanted to purchase inexpensive consumer items, Walmart also began its historic and explosive growth, reimporting these departed items from far cheaper shores to an American consumer who didn&#39;t realize that the economic ground was shifting beneath his sneaker&#45;clad feet.&amp;nbsp; The effect was that the corporate sector switched the track beneath this speeding train, changing it to a line that was now running on an incline while the American consumer was slowly running out of fuel.&amp;nbsp; A railroad coal car might look full when it starts, but it eventually runs out of the coal.&amp;nbsp;
So that&#39;s where we are.&amp;nbsp; The train is running out of fuel and the management is telling us to shovel for all our worth, but the fuel is depleting.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve become conditioned to shoveling despite the growing realization that the only way to make the train keep running is to go more slowly and do a better job of managing what we have.&amp;nbsp;
Do I have to spend more than 96% of my disposable income in order to be happy?&amp;nbsp; Will that thingymabob make me more satisfied?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a personal decision for each of us and I can now attest that breaking the mantra of six decades will require work and real readjustment of my priorities.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s one that we have to begin making now.&amp;nbsp; The economic future facing our children truly is going to be more constrained than what they have now and if they don&#39;t learn how to make more responsible choices from us while we&#39;re not completely over the barrel, then they&#39;ll be forced to contend with a cognitive dissonance that dwarves the discomfort which I faced.&amp;nbsp;
So what happened with the present for Middle&#39;s upcoming birthday?&amp;nbsp; The result was a &amp;quot;victory&amp;quot; for the personal budget over common good as I went with the sale and got the price differential.&amp;nbsp; But the dissonance is still there.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m annoyed with myself for not recognizing the size of the price differences and accounting for it up front.&amp;nbsp; More importantly however, is the realization that there has to be purposeful conversation over the question of how much is enough? so that this little foray into globalization can have a different ending.</body>

<title>Calculating Real Price Rises:&nbsp; The Effect of &#8220;Stealth&#8221; Inflation</title>
<body>What is the true effect of &amp;quot;stealth&amp;quot; inflation and to what extent does it hide the real effect of price increases to the consumer?
People who do the family shopping can tell when things have obviously gone up in price, a pound of hamburger being a classic example.&amp;nbsp; But there are instances when the shopper will look at something and suddenly wonder if the package &#45; the container itself and not the design &#45; is different.&amp;nbsp; The sense is occasionally akin to seeing something out of the corner of your eye and wondering whether that actually occurred or if you imagined it.&amp;nbsp; What is now referred to as &amp;quot;stealth&amp;quot; inflation is when a manufacturer alters the package size in order to minimize the price increases that are being&amp;nbsp; passed on to the consumer; if you know that too large a rise in price will cause the consumer to shift elsewhere, you simply pass through a smaller increase and quietly cut the package size so that less is being sold per package.&amp;nbsp; The net effect is a nominal price decrease &#45; or no change &#45; on the package but a slight increase in the package&#39;s profit per unit (ounce, for example).
The real impact of stealth inflation is that the true price that people pay is understated by an unknown amount.&amp;nbsp; The sticker for the item sold might say $1, but in reality,&amp;nbsp;the consumer has to pay $1.10 for the same amount than was purchased before.&amp;nbsp;
With questions about how the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve &#45; Quantitative Easing and ZIRP &#45; affect the economy and whether they would ultimately fuel inflation, I created the PracticalDad Price Index in the Fall of 2010.&amp;nbsp; The index consists of 47 separate items commonly available in the grocery store and each is for the less expensive store brand, unless there was no generic equivalent available at any of the three unrelated supermarkets.&amp;nbsp; The philosophic premise behind the basket is that it&#39;s composed of common grocery items that would be purchased by a cost&#45;conscious parent, trying to make ends meet on a simple monthly budget; it doesn&#39;t presume to be the full quantity of food that would be purchased by a family of X members for a month but only the type of common item that a family would purchase.&amp;nbsp;
The key to running a price index is consistency.&amp;nbsp; Not only must you track the specific kind of item, but you also have to keep tabs on the packaging size as well.&amp;nbsp; Comparing one size can in a store to another size in a different store is an apples to oranges comparison and thus useless; in the case of the index&#39;s ice cream entry, one store&#39;s generic container was different from the others and I was forced to price on a unit (per quart) level.&amp;nbsp; The problem with pricing on a unit level is that it becomes impossible to account for stealth inflation and that was one of the factors that I wanted to track.&amp;nbsp; Over the two years, when I&#39;ve noted instances of stealth inflation via packaging, I&#39;ve adjusted the item&#39;s price to what it would be for the original container size.&amp;nbsp; For example, all the grocery stores in November sold store brand coffee in 13 ounce containers.&amp;nbsp; When a store began to sell in 11 ounce containers, I converted the new price for the 11 ounce container back to an equivalent amount for the original 13 ounce container.&amp;nbsp;
Example:&amp;nbsp; Store A sold coffee at $3.50 in a 13 ounce container.&amp;nbsp; The next month, it sells coffee for $3.40 &#45; a nominal price decrease &#45; but the container is now 11 ounces.&amp;nbsp; Recalculating for the change [($3.40/11)*13] yields an equivalent price of $4.02 for a 13 ounce can, were the coffee sold in the old container size of 13 ounces.&amp;nbsp; Et Voila!&amp;nbsp; A nominal decline of 2.8% hides a real increase of 14.8%.
The first pricing occurred in November, 2010&amp;nbsp;with the full cost of the initial basket at $178.39, which became the index basis level of 100.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t until the Spring of 2012 that I considered the effects of policies upon food alone and apart from non&#45;food items; of the 47 items in the basket, ten are not food items per se, but grocery items such as soap, aluminum foil and ibuprofen.&amp;nbsp; I subsequently returned to the data and separated the ten non&#45;food items from the remainder with the result that of the $178.39 spent on the entire basket, $89.14 was spent on food only.&amp;nbsp; This amount of $89.14 for November 2010 became the index basis level of 100 for food only.&amp;nbsp; Of the 47 items in the marketbasket, five items have undergone package decreases in the past two years, either in all of the stores (coffee, sugar and women&#39;s pads) or in at least one of the stores (orange juice and kidney beans).&amp;nbsp; Each of the items is recalculated to account for the stealth inflation.
The results of the October 2012 &#45; the 24th month of data collected &#45;&amp;nbsp;are presented below for both the Total Index and Food&#45;only Index (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The first column &#45; &amp;quot;Actual&amp;quot; &#45; is calculated for the Index and accounts for the impact of stealth inflation.&amp;nbsp; The second column &#45; &amp;quot;Nominal&amp;quot; &#45; lists the Index figures using the nominal prices on the grocery store shelves, without adjusting for the impact of stealth inflation.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Actual&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Nominal&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;106.42&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 105.02&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Food&#45;only&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;111.80&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 110.17&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
In the Total Index, the nominal figure of 5.02 is a startling 28% [(6.42&#45;5.02)/5.02] understatement while the Food&#45;only Index is 16% understated [(11.8&#45;10.17)/10.17].&amp;nbsp; In fairness, the massive Total&#45;Index understatement can be statistically attributed to the&amp;nbsp;oversized effect of the price activity of one item &#45; specifically women&#39;s pads &#45; in relation to the total dollar value of the basket.&amp;nbsp; The pads&amp;nbsp;have undergone large price declines in both nominal and real terms over the two year period and this has produced an outsized effect upon the basket.&amp;nbsp; But when this item is removed along with the remainder of the non&#45;food products to leave only foodstuffs however, there is still a significant 16% differential between the nominal and the stealth&#45;adjusted figures.
The upshot is this.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A great deal, both in terms of Fed policy and actual&amp;nbsp;government spending, is predicated upon the possession and use of accurate information.&amp;nbsp; If the information is badly misrepresented or skewed, then the policy actions will be correspondingly skewed.&amp;nbsp; The Fed and the government presently state that inflation, the core&#45;CPI, is minimal and are pursuing policies intended to provoke an upshot of inflation.&amp;nbsp; But is the price information that they&#39;re using accurate or are things percolating along even more than is reported?</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Two Years and Counting</title>
<body>The PracticalDad market basket of 47 grocery store items was taken and calculated today, with two years of consistent pricing now under the belt.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been much speculation about what will occur to prices once the Federal Reserve&#39;s next round of Quantitative Easing &#45; the third to date &#45; works through the economy and while everyone has an opinion, the data from the basket shows that while the Total PracticalDad Marketbasket Index decreased by more than a full basis point to 106.42 (from 107.50), the Food&#45;only segment of the basket rose slightly from September&#39;s 111.67 to 111.80; this is an increase in the food&#45;only segment of 11.8% since the index&#39;s inception in November 2010.
A grocery market basket of 47 items &#45; of which ten of those are not edible food products &#45; is admittedly a tiny sample of the thousands of items available in the standard grocery store.&amp;nbsp; But&amp;nbsp;having been the family shopper and cook&amp;nbsp;for years, I believe that it&#39;s an accurate microcosm of the typical family&#39;s essential shopping list, stripped down to what a typical family trying to make ends meet would purchase.&amp;nbsp; Given the uncertainty over the monetary policy actions, especially as it pertains to food, I&#39;ve begun to track the spread between the two index values with the thought that it would be, while only a datapoint, indicative of the impact of easy money upon foodstuffs.&amp;nbsp; After all, we can cut back on non&#45;essentials such as books and trips, but our ability to cut back on basic foodstuffs is limited.&amp;nbsp; Unless of course, we plan to starve.
Month/Year&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;only Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Spread

One of the best comments that I&#39;ve ever read about inflation in light of present monetary policy was posted by &amp;quot;Dryfly&amp;quot;, a commenter on www.calculatedriskblog.com.&amp;nbsp; Several years ago, he wrote that we&#39;ll probably see deflation in what we want and inflation in what we need; declining incomes will force us to cut back on non&#45;essential purchases while the exceptionally loose monetary policies will force prices upwards on our essentials, especially food.&amp;nbsp; The non&#45;essential cutbacks will cause manufacturers to keep a lid on their pricing, while the food and commodity producers will be able to &#45; within reason &#45; pass these through to the consumer.&amp;nbsp; It might not be perfect, but I think that the spread will serve as&amp;nbsp;a reasonable indicator of the effect of monetary policy upon prices, especially the essentials versus the non&#45;essentials.&amp;nbsp;
Expect to see the spread each month as we move forward.</body>

<title>Condensing the Answer for the Kids</title>
<body>The shirt somehow came into the house, probably on the back or in the gym bag of one of the plethora of kids that visit or spend the night and typically, wound up in the hamper.&amp;nbsp; It was a grey t&#45;shirt with large orange block letters exclaiming Just Do It and after washing, went into Youngest&#39;s dresser drawer; it was&amp;nbsp;his size and while I didn&#39;t recognize it, I put it there just so that it had a place and wouldn&#39;t wind up in yet another of the piles of stuff that litters the household.&amp;nbsp; My thought was that I&#39;d figure out the owner later when some of the guys wound up here.&amp;nbsp; But when Youngest came down for breakfast before school the other morning, he was wearing the shirt.&amp;nbsp; I looked at it and then the clock as he&#39;d pushed the time to the limit before having to scoot for the bus.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t one that we considered school appropriate but it was an instance that I decided to let slide with a warning, just so you know, that shirt isn&#39;t returning to school after today.&amp;nbsp; He glanced at me and asked why he couldn&#39;t wear it and in that moment, I had to stop and think carefully before responding, mindful of the time and yet still wanting to give him a coherent answer.
Bill Cosby has mined a huge amount of material from his kids and the brief comment that stays with me about children is the&amp;nbsp;question and response, Why is there air?&amp;nbsp; To blow up basketballs.&amp;nbsp; The core of the response is that kids are curious and want an answer, but they don&#39;t have the attention span and will tune out the response until they get a bit older, so you&#39;d better keep it short.&amp;nbsp; When to start going into greater depth is dependent upon your sense of the kid and the circumstances.&amp;nbsp; He was curious,&amp;nbsp;without attitude and there was enough to get a decent response without a curt because I said so.&amp;nbsp; I asked him to wait a moment while thinking about a decent answer; you know how much money corporations make, and that you&#39;ve heard me say that they have too much power, right?&amp;nbsp; It bothers me that we pay money for the shirts with these taglines that give them free advertising on top of the money that we&#39;ve already spent.&amp;nbsp; It winds up giving them even more money and makes us nothing more than another tool.&amp;nbsp;
He cocked his head in that way of his and then asked, well what about Under Armour?&amp;nbsp; They have their logo on their shirts and even on my cleats.&amp;nbsp; Do I have to give up the cleats?
I shook my head.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have a problem with a logo by itself...almost everything has a logo and that&#39;s all part of advertising.&amp;nbsp; But when it&#39;s so huge and obviously just an ad for their tag line, then I think that we can do without it.&amp;nbsp; At some point you say enough and that shirt is past that point.&amp;nbsp; I considered having him go upstairs to change it after the comment, but the exchange was so measured and without angst that I figured that one day would be fine; the shirt would simply never make it back from the next load of wash.&amp;nbsp; Youngest nodded and went back to finishing off breakfast and afterwards, the shirt went on its sole trip to school.
There have been plenty of times when the situation hasn&#39;t worked, either because the kids resisted the request which made for a problematic civil conversation or because I couldn&#39;t find the right words to get the point across.&amp;nbsp; But when it works, it can be a beautiful thing for the brevity and effect and with younger kids, brevity is better.&amp;nbsp; When it came time that evening for baseball practice, I glanced at Youngest&#39;s cleats.&amp;nbsp; Under Armour makes cleats?

<title>Dumbing Down Parenthood:&nbsp; Kudos for Attending Meet the Teacher Night</title>
<body>Almost all school districts host a &amp;quot;Meet the Teacher&amp;quot; night at the beginning of the school year and ours occurred two weeks ago.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The purpose of these events is an opportunity for parents to meet the teachers and put a face to a name on the schedule.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also there for teachers to provide parents and guardians with a background on some of what&#39;s upcoming during the year; the curriculum that&#39;s being used and what their expectations are for the students.&amp;nbsp; This in and of itself is refreshing since there&#39;s typically a gaping disconnect between what the kids report and the reality of things.&amp;nbsp; At our district, the elementary events are scheduled in the late afternoon through early evening with a short interval until the beginning of the high school event, a courtesy extended to parents with kids at both levels.
I raced from Youngest&#39;s event at one school to Middle&#39;s event at the other and while missing the Principal&#39;s opening remarks at the latter, I made it to Middle&#39;s&amp;nbsp;First Block class in time to get the appropriate paperwork and hear the teacher.&amp;nbsp; What struck me at this session &#45; and through later sessions with other teachers &#45; was the verbal kudos given by the teachers for taking the time from our busy schedules to attend.&amp;nbsp; While not every teacher mentioned it, I heard it more than once that evening and I&#39;d lay odds that the Principal said something similar in his remarks.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re giving me kudos for attending Meet the Teacher night?&amp;nbsp; Seriously?&amp;nbsp; While there are some who deserve such because they&#39;ve had to miss second shift work, they&#39;re in the minority.&amp;nbsp; The rest of us are there because it&#39;s in our best interests as parents and taxpayers to get a gander at what&#39;s in store for the year with our kids; indeed, it&#39;s my expectation to attend unless death or distance keeps me otherwise occupied.&amp;nbsp;
We live in a district where the parents apparently do give a damn since the parking lot at both schools was full and parents and grandparents flooded the hallways between sessions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But even then, it was jarring to think that&amp;nbsp;the educators felt it important to recognize us for something that&#39;s as necessary and part of our parental responsibilities as coming to meet the teachers.&amp;nbsp; Parents have basic elemental responsibilities for the kids &#45; food, shelter, clothing and assuring an education.&amp;nbsp; While we don&#39;t homeschool the kids, we still have to assure that things are proceeding apace and these sessions are part and parcel of providing that responsibility.&amp;nbsp; Parents shouldn&#39;t be so dumbed down and out of touch that we have to receive strokes for&amp;nbsp;something as simple as attending a Meet the Teacher event and I can only wonder, what&#39;s being said amongst the educational community that educators need to praise us for something so simple.</body>

<title>Is an 18 Year old an Adult?</title>
<body>If anything has caught my attention through the myriad articles about student debt, especially those with first&#45;person stories, it&#39;s been the recurrent comment, I wish someone had told me...

    how much that I&#39;d be paying each month...
    that I couldn&#39;t get a job with this degree...
    that I didn&#39;t need to attend a private college instead of a public university...&amp;nbsp;

As I read the articles, my&amp;nbsp;persistent thought was to wonder where in the hell the parent was.&amp;nbsp; These major financial and career decisions &#45; with repercussions lasting for decades &#45; are being made by teens with&amp;nbsp;no actual life experience.&amp;nbsp; The deeper questions beyond these however, are whether 18 and 19 year&#45;olds are&amp;nbsp;adults and when we should&amp;nbsp;expect that our&amp;nbsp;offspring have reached adulthood.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s not an academic question.&amp;nbsp; More parents are finding that their kids are retreating back to the nests, or seem to be only treading water instead of swimming for the bright, distant horizon as they remember that they themselves did.&amp;nbsp; Our history is seemingly filled with examples of young people &#45; adults &#45; taking on the mantle of responsibility in any number of ways, whether in terms of career, marriage and family, or simply extraordinary acts of adventure and exploration.&amp;nbsp; Of course, our history is also littered with far more bodies than we seem to have today, as more died much earlier in life of accident or previously incurable disease.&amp;nbsp; Cholera, it&#39;s what&#39;s for supper...&amp;nbsp; As much as we love our kids, after years of caring for and raising them, there&#39;s an expectation that life after a certain point will be more relaxed with less of the stress that comes with children and teenagers and there seems to be&amp;nbsp;a degree of regret when they do return, both that they&#39;re unable to move outwards into&amp;nbsp;a new life for themselves&amp;nbsp;and that we have to return to&amp;nbsp;our previous&amp;nbsp;role.&amp;nbsp; No offense to anyone reading this in their&amp;nbsp;twenties, but just wait until&amp;nbsp;you have teenagers.&amp;nbsp;
To say that it was an academic question would imply that it was already&amp;nbsp;settled&amp;nbsp;and it now appears that it isn&#39;t by any stretch of the imagination.&amp;nbsp; Through the mid 1990s, the credo was that adulthood was defined by certain specific life actions &#45; marriage, setting up a household, leaving home for a new job, having a child.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But a psychologist named&amp;nbsp;Jeffrey Arnett&amp;nbsp;did the unthinkable and actually interviewed approximately 300 young adults, all in their twenties.&amp;nbsp; The upshot of his findings&amp;nbsp;from these interviews&amp;nbsp;was that adulthood wasn&#39;t a discrete location reached after passing identifiable waypoints, but that it was a process, fluid and imprecise with the interviewees responding that they often felt &amp;quot;in&#45;between&amp;quot; adulthood and adolescence when presented with specific questions.&amp;nbsp; This new view has become known as emerging adulthood.&amp;nbsp; The defenders of the other side &#45; that adulthood was reached by the assumption of specific roles at completing certain life actions &#45; maintain their stance and that there&#39;s no such thing as emerging adulthood; instead, it continues to be the purpose of the adolescent/teen years to prepare the way to adulthood.&amp;nbsp;
The literal question is whether there really is such a thing as emerging adulthood or are young people simply &amp;quot;stalled&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;and somehow unable to reach adulthood?&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m uncertain as to the answer myself, my own question is different:&amp;nbsp; if they are indeed &amp;quot;stalled&amp;quot;, what&#39;s happening during the adolescent years that&#39;s no longer preparing them for adulthood as with previous generations?&amp;nbsp; What has happened?
Certainly one of the biggest differences is that so many more of our children are living in single&#45;parent families.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve gone through about two generations since the divorce rate exploded in the 1970s and there&#39;s certainly an impact that arises from growing up as a child of a split family,&amp;nbsp; most especially when the father figure is absent.&amp;nbsp; The obvious difficulty for the children is that the mother, who routinely got custody, was stretched like taffy as she had to both provide a roof over the head as well as parent and keep the house in a semblance of running order.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s a generalization to state that by nature, the mother has historically been oriented inwards to the family with an attention to detail and sensitivity that keeps the household and family in order.&amp;nbsp; Conversely, the father was the parent who directed his attention outwards in order to help provide food, shelter and protection for the family.&amp;nbsp; It was by watching the father that children learned best how to respond to the challenges provided by the outside world, and who made them feel most secure from its real and perceived dangers.&amp;nbsp; When the father was removed &#45; and the mother had to stretch to cover the difference &#45; a significant minority of children suffered a loss and were consequently hampered in learning what a father could teach.&amp;nbsp; Their collective ability was eroded and coupled with the continuing numbers of children affected by divorce, the cumulative erosion to what children could learn from a good father was deep and significant.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to say that all fathers are great models of how to respond to and interact with the outside world, but there&#39;s been a significant cumulative erosion through two generations.
Even with this erosion across more than one generation, today&#39;s generation is one which&amp;nbsp;we&#39;ve permitted them to insulate themselves from the outside world by cocooning within electronics.&amp;nbsp; With kids today now spending more than six hours daily in front of some form of electonic screen &#45; not counting the time tethered to an mp3 of iPod &#45; they&#39;re spending time alone and physically disconnected from the human interaction that they need for learning to live in the real world.&amp;nbsp; They readily inhabit a virtual reality in which they&#39;re connecting with all manner of people who create an online avatar that&#39;s often nothing like their physical reality.&amp;nbsp; Even for someone who&#39;s worked through the&amp;nbsp; years to keep the electronics under control, the pull is insidious.&amp;nbsp; The result is that we have individuals who thrive in a virtual reality but are wholly unprepared for the harsher physical reality; this is especially the case for young people who are now having to work for older people who have far more and greater experience in this world.
This leads to the fact that our society is a far more complex place with greater demands than in previous decades and generations.&amp;nbsp; While younger people are more comfortable with the personal technology than older people, the country runs on more complex structures than in the past.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a greater interconnectedness amongst the questions and issues facing&amp;nbsp;us that requires attention, effort and critical thinking to understand.&amp;nbsp; When you&#39;re spending your time paying greater attention to the screens than the world around you, you&#39;re at a huge disadvantage to someone who has paid attention.&amp;nbsp; With the Occupy movement seemingly comatose after only a year of existence, its detractors dissect it and criticize the apparent naivete and hamhandedness with which it functioned.&amp;nbsp; My thought throughout its existence was that it was akin to the political baby steps of a new generation having to learn to walk and function all the while being pushed about in the midst of a riot.&amp;nbsp; No shit they&#39;re disjointed and a bit goofy, they&#39;ve finally unplugged and awakened to the political and social reality and are thrashing about.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s like watching Neo being unplugged and flushed from the Matrix cocoon.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve created an economic system predicated upon consumption, much of it increasingly mindless.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Research has been done in improving advertising and driving the typical consumer into a decision that&#39;s collectively good for the system, but bad for the individual.&amp;nbsp; More is better, so supersize it...housing values only go up...go ahead and take on the college debt, it&#39;s a good debt and an investment in yourself...If you&#39;re a young person who&#39;s been heavily tied into the electronic world, not paying attention to what&#39;s occurring around you and there&#39;s no one trying to take the time to explain this to you, then you&#39;re fodder for the system until you suffer enough damage that you&#39;re forced to critically&amp;nbsp;re&#45;examine and&amp;nbsp;figure it out for yourself.&amp;nbsp; The flip side to this is that our consumption shortsightedness has sent a large chunk of our livable wage jobs overseas; there aren&#39;t the requisite jobs around anymore that will support the debt that&#39;s incurred on behalf of the system.&amp;nbsp;
Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s hard to feel like an adult when the economic circumstances of debt and livelihood prevent or slow those steps that mark the supposed waypoints into traditional adulthood.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, it&#39;s hard to feel like an adult when there&#39;s no one older to tell you that uncertainty and fear don&#39;t depart just because you&#39;re now considered an adult.&amp;nbsp; That continues and you simply learn to harness it.
I do understand how you can feel &amp;quot;in&#45;between&amp;quot; adulthood and adolescence.&amp;nbsp; My college graduation occurred in the midst of a severe recession and my job&#45;search efforts only resulted in a huge stack of rejection letters that festered in a desk drawer; when a friend came by one day to grouse that his B in Accounting was screwing up the GPA, I simply pulled the stack out and tossed it in front of him, telling him to shut up and get the hell out of here.&amp;nbsp; My first year or more out of college was spent back living in my old bedroom, working at a job that barely paid enough to allow me to live at home on the highly reduced rent that my parents charged me, what my father jokingly referred to as Section Dad Housing.&amp;nbsp; I now had the responsibilities that came with a job but wasn&#39;t able to take on the other aspects of adulthood, living on my own and setting my own rules and boundaries, exploring the freedom that ostensibly came with true adulthood.&amp;nbsp; But those were feelings and that didn&#39;t mean that I didn&#39;t continue the adult route of working at the job and continuing to search for a job and career that would permit me to be fully responsible for myself, my actions and decisions.&amp;nbsp; Conversations with both of my parents&amp;nbsp;taught me that uncertainty, nervousness and fear don&#39;t just go away because you&#39;re the adult; what changes is how you have to respond to them and handle them.&amp;nbsp; To hear your 60 year old father admit uncertainty in the face of job and career change is highly instructive.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot from my vantagepoint is that today&#39;s typical 18 year old isn&#39;t an adult, but is as Eldest&#39;s college dean described, an adult&#45;in&#45;training.&amp;nbsp; It will be our job to engage in the delicate, mistake&#45;prone shift from guardians to &#45; hopefully &#45; good friends as she takes on her own decisions and grows in her own ability to handle her responsibilities.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Guys With Kids</title>
<body>Jimmy Fallon understands that kids are funny and many of his commercials demonstrate this as he plays foil to toddlers and infants.&amp;nbsp; But while his new show, Guys With Kids, ostensibly pertains to kids, the humor comes from exploring the changing and new frontiers of fatherhood.&amp;nbsp; Some reviewers find nothing funny about the show but as a guy who&#39;s spent years on the cutting edge of bending gender roles, it&#39;s also spot on in touching upon some of the issues facing men who now take an active father role.
Each of the three main characters, all close friends, is representative of a different fatherhood model &#45; the traditional working father (Zach Creggar as Nick), divorced with joint custody (Jesse Bradford as Chris) and homemaker father (Anthony Anderson as Gary).&amp;nbsp; This trio is part of a new generation of television fathers, akin to NBC&#39;s Parenthood, who take an active, involved and hands&#45;on role in the care and raising of their children.&amp;nbsp; Humor aside, how does this particular program do a decent job of examining what men face and how things are changing?
They actively incorporate the kids into their daily lives.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s jarring to see dads take their babies into a sports bar, but they want to maintain their friendship and instead of having to find sitters so that they can gather separately, they take the kids along with them.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s an acknowledgement that fatherhood isn&#39;t compartmentalized into one facet of a man&#39;s life, but instead permeates it so that if the other guys have kids, they just bring them along as well.&amp;nbsp; In previous eras, the kids would be at home with the mother or the babysitter while the guys gather but with men taking a larger role, they adapt accordingly to make it work.
Does Mother automatically know best by dint of childbirth?&amp;nbsp; The divorced dad contends with a sense of parental inferiority when his concerns and opinions are undercut by his ex&#45;wife&#39;s rote response of grew inside me to any disagreement that they might have about the baby.&amp;nbsp; The explosion in the divorce rate in the 1970s left many fathers out in the proverbial cold as the legal system simply adopted the credo that mother knows best in terms of the well&#45;being and care of the child and realistically, the typical father back then wasn&#39;t clued into the daily issues of childcare and raising kids.&amp;nbsp; But two generations of fatherhood advocates have argued that men are capable of effectively and lovingly raising children and the actions of a new generation of fathers &#45; many of whom have the insight of having been a child of divorce &#45; have taken the opportunity to heart and the court system has begun reassessing whether custody questions should be determined solely by gender.
While I do believe that there&#39;s such a thing as maternal intuition, I&amp;nbsp;think that it&#39;s partially a function of having spent so much time around the children that a feel is developed for what&#39;s occurring.&amp;nbsp; Years ago, I spoke with a new mother who admitted that when her husband asked her a question about the baby, she responded that she was also new to the baby experience; that fact that she had given birth to a baby didn&#39;t necessarily make her an immediate expert on what was best in the moment.&amp;nbsp; The key difference is that there&#39;s a broad and deep support network for new mothers, a huge sisterhood of maternal mentors that really doesn&#39;t exist for new fathers.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the media is constantly churning out a supply of new and/or reissued materials for the mother.&amp;nbsp; But even this network breaks down, as evidenced by the existence of lactation consultants; this subspecialty would never have come into existence had two generations of mothers not bought into the Madison Avenue schtick that mother&#39;s milk wasn&#39;t as good as manufactured formula.&amp;nbsp; When the medical evidence conclusively showed that nursing benefits outweighed that of formula, literally an entire generation of mothers had no clue how to nurse and even their mothers couldn&#39;t help them because they themselves didn&#39;t know how to nurse.
It&#39;s not the gender, it&#39;s the role.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a common image of a frazzled housewife with small children, chronically ill&#45;tempered and a wee bit squirrelly with the kids all around them.&amp;nbsp; Bill Cosby did a terrific routine on the changes in his beloved wife when she encountered doofus husband feeding the kids cake for breakfast and her response to this ridiculous situation.&amp;nbsp; The upshot through the years is the perception that these changes and images are largely common to women by dint of being...women.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that spending all of your time in the homemaker role is what makes the person change, regardless of the gender.&amp;nbsp; I speak from experience and truly laughed aloud when Gary, the stay&#45;at&#45;home dad, commiserated with Nick&#39;s wife &#45; also a stay&#45;at&#45;home mom &#45; about what the working mates don&#39;t realize.&amp;nbsp; Yes, they dished and I&#39;ve been in the same situation where a group of us sit and share war stories.&amp;nbsp; The effect upon a father, tasked with cleaning up after and raising multiple children, will likewise make him cranky and a bit forgetful.
Children take over your life.&amp;nbsp; Both married fathers joke about enjoying &amp;quot;playing with&amp;quot; the divorced father&#39;s life, helping him meet new women; they live vicariously through him.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t love their mates, but they recognize that the full&#45;time responsibility of child&#45;rearing and providing a roof means that the freedom that being single allowed is a thing of the past.&amp;nbsp; When you&#39;re responsible for the care and raising of children, even teens, you don&#39;t have the latitude that existed before their arrival.
What has truly taken me aback however, has nothing to do with the show itself.&amp;nbsp; As I took notes prior to beginning this article, I came across a television critic&#39;s review&amp;nbsp;in which the reviewer described the three men as emasculated.&amp;nbsp; I actually watched the show again and nowhere in it do I find anything that would denote the three characters as being anything less than men.&amp;nbsp; Goofy, sometimes uncomfortable with their responsibilities?&amp;nbsp; Absolutely, since that&#39;s the nature of television and the situation in which many new fathers find themselves.&amp;nbsp; But as the show revolves around men being responsible and taking care of children, the nagging sense is that there&#39;s a belief that caring for the kids is emasculating and that men who step up to that role are less than real men.&amp;nbsp; I believe that there&#39#39;s nothing emasculating about the role but if the reviewer would like to see us return to the traditional masculine role, then we&#39;ll just go back&amp;nbsp;to leaving the kids unsupervised while the mothers are out working, and we&#39;ll see how that works out in another decade.
Knock yourself out, Sport.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d rather be a guy with kids.

<title>Is College Necessary?&nbsp; Vocation and Avocation</title>
<body>One of the questions with which I wrestle is about when and how to introduce the kids into the real world, the world in which we have to make choices and our dreams don&#39;t always come true.&amp;nbsp; This is especially relevant in light of the ongoing conversation about whether a college degree is worth the money that&#39;s going to be spent obtaining it. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;d been talking about Eldest&#39;s experiences thus far in college, including playing soccer.&amp;nbsp; Youngest looked at me and asked Dad, can I major in baseball? since he loves the sport and has aspirations of a pro career.&amp;nbsp; It was during the following conversation that he now understood that while she played for love of the game, her college studies didn&#39;t involve soccer but were geared towards something else entirely.&amp;nbsp; He also learned the words vocation and avocation; the former pertaining to what one does for a living and the other to what one does for enjoyment and love. As he learned, they can sometimes be one and the same but more often than not, they&#39;re different.&amp;nbsp; Youngest cocked his head and nodded, silent for a moment.&amp;nbsp; In that interval, I told him that he could certainly play baseball in college if he wanted &#45; and was good enough &#45; but that the course of study would most likely be different.&amp;nbsp; He leaned back against the kitchen counter and then inquired whether he could study to be a history teacher instead.&amp;nbsp;
Damn, I thought, another career with lousy job prospects.&amp;nbsp; My response was a &#45; hopefully &#45; encouraging sure, if that&#39;s what you really want and are good at it.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t see why you couldn&#39;t take that route, but I wouldn&#39;t worry about it now since there&#39;s still plenty of time before college.&amp;nbsp;
When to begin these conversations is a matter of personal choice, although we&#39;ve held off on the conversations until middle school; this is the point at which&amp;nbsp;our local school system begins to have kids look towards the future by engaging in career shadowing.&amp;nbsp; If the&amp;nbsp;kids have to start looking at potential careers, then it&#39;s a logical starting point for household conversations.&amp;nbsp; When Eldest talked about becoming a marine biologist, our family conversations veered towards what courses might be involved and what schools offered the degree.&amp;nbsp; Where were they located and did they mesh with the type of college environment that she&#39;d thought would be a good fit for her personality?&amp;nbsp; Did the career require solely a bachelor&#39;s degree or was she looking at further graduate work to become a viably employable biologist?&amp;nbsp; Was this a career that would permit her to move or would she be restricted to certain geographic areas?&amp;nbsp; Could we get her through with minimal or no debt?&amp;nbsp; I offered my own trenchant question:&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re asking me to remove your dead pet hermit crab because it&#39;s gross, is this the career for you?&amp;nbsp; The point is to probe and engage, discuss and explore options and questions with them until they&#39;re more clear on what&#39;s involved.
While I&#39;d thought that the school system was an ally in educating your child &#45; and in most ways it is &#45; I&#39;ve come to learn that there are instances when the system automatically slots kids into prearranged tracks that really aren&#39;t appropriate for them.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t just assume that the system is the expert in your child&#39;s best interest and don&#39;t be afraid to buck it if necessary.&amp;nbsp; The great majority of secondary schools have tracks for students broken into three segments:&amp;nbsp; Career Prep (for those not deemed ready or able to attend college); College Prep; Honors (for more advanced study).&amp;nbsp; Based upon grades and teacher/counselor assessments, your kid will be matched to a level that ultimately leads to a certain conclusion.&amp;nbsp; During a baseball practice several weeks ago, I chatted with a mother whose older son was presently in the local high school.&amp;nbsp; This student, a Junior, was intellectually advanced and the school counselor was strongly that he take both Advanced Placement Physics and Advanced Placement Calculus, courses that would prepare him for a career in science and engineering after attaining a college degree.&amp;nbsp; But they were balking at the placement as the boy&#39;s interest was in becoming a heavy engine diesel mechanic and he was gifted with an ability to understand the practical workings.&amp;nbsp; As she said, Why should we prepare him for college when his skills are outside of that?&amp;nbsp; Why take on all of that debt when the degree will have no bearing on his employment?&amp;nbsp; The final remark saddened me as much as I&#39;m sure it did her:&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re making it paycheck to paycheck and he&#39;s probably going to have to work the same way that we do.&amp;nbsp; The student debt will just make it worse.&amp;nbsp;

That comment is a microcosm of what all of us fear as parents.
In the summer of 2011, we took a family vacation to Europe &#45; a trip for which we saved for several years.&amp;nbsp; On our first day in Rome, we took a guided tour of the catacombs and surprisingly, our guide was a young American expatriate who&#39;d come to Rome in search of work.&amp;nbsp; His degree was in Western Civilization and saddled with student debt and unable to get a job here, he&#39;d taken what amounted to a desperate, courageous gamble by putting that education to use as a guide in the cradle of Renaissance civilization, Italy.&amp;nbsp; One of his comments in our conversations actually haunts me:&amp;nbsp; I wish that someone had told me that I couldn&#39;t get a job with a degree in Western Civ.&amp;nbsp; No parent wants to potentially shatter a child&#39;s dream by pointing out the pitfalls and practicability of a career option.&amp;nbsp; But keeping silent or leaving the route to someone else can shatter the dream with a burdensome debt that can take decades to satisfy.&amp;nbsp;

<title>How Do You Create Resilient Kids?</title>
<body>We&#39;ve now had about a generation&#39;s worth of helicopter parents, hovering over their children from the toddler years and in some cases, even into the workforce.&amp;nbsp; A local hospital, at which a close friend works, even had a seminar for managers about how to relate to the new generation of employees; her response was less than lukewarm.&amp;nbsp; But the meme is changing and more adults are questioning how helpful this approach has been, especially in light of the changes rippling through the national economy.&amp;nbsp; Paul Tough recently published How Children Succeed:  Grit, Curiosity, and the Hidden Power of Character, which probes whether high grades are sufficient in and of themselves for success or whether a child&#39;s grit and character are more important.&amp;nbsp; The key term in his title is grit, which we can define as the ability to persist through a difficult situation or circumstance.&amp;nbsp; In a future in which livelihoods are likely to be more hardscrabble and financial freedom more difficult to attain than before, grit is indeed likely to be key.&amp;nbsp; But how do we help our children develop this particular character trait?
Our society is full of examples of people who&#39;ve overcome to achieve success.&amp;nbsp; In a recent interview with Time magazine, Dwayne Wade was asked whether his upbringing in a challenging environment contributed to his resilience; he responded that I give a lot of credit to my upbringing in Chicago.&amp;nbsp; It taught me to be tough, to want more, to want to be better.&amp;nbsp; It made me appreciate things.&amp;nbsp; But does that mean that our kids have to go through difficult childhoods in order to develop resilience?&amp;nbsp; What does that mean for parents who work assiduously to assure that their kids don&#39;t encounter the inner&#45;city life that claims far more youth than produces successful survivors like Wade?
Grit and resilience are &#45; at a basic level &#45; simply components of a person&#39;s natural character; there are some who have the ability to persist in spades while there are&amp;nbsp;a few&amp;nbsp;who are simply so fragile that it doesn&#39;t exist.&amp;nbsp; My own sense is that it&#39;s akin to a bell curve with the majority possessing it in some degree, waiting to be brought out and developed by upbringing and life.&amp;nbsp; Unless our children encounter truly difficult circumstances in their youth, we can never know exactly how they respond when life forces them to that truly dark place that almost all of us will encounter in our lifetime.&amp;nbsp; Until then, all that we can do is assess what we do see every day and try to instill and teach that which does reinforce grit and resilience.&amp;nbsp; But what are some of those things that we can do?
First, understand that our kids are watching us and learning from us in everything that we do.&amp;nbsp; Our attitudes and behaviors, our responses and opinions all are being sopped up even though we aren&#39;t aware of it in the moment.&amp;nbsp; How am I acting when things don&#39;t go my way and what do I say?&amp;nbsp; In my childhood, the response to most difficulties was a shrug and the phrase you&#39;ll have this; when I once asked my father &#45; a Korean War veteran &#45; how he could be so calm, his response was since there aren&#39;t half a million Chinese shooting at me, it&#39;s really not that bad.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to say that there weren&#39;t&amp;nbsp;and aren&#39;t going to be profanities when things screw up, but things go on.&amp;nbsp;
Second, don&#39;t be afraid to tell your children no.&amp;nbsp; The earlier that they learn that things aren&#39;t always to go their way, even little things, the more resilient they&#39;re likely to be when a big thing doesn&#39;t go their way.&amp;nbsp;
Third, don&#39;t be afraid to let the kids struggle.&amp;nbsp; If she brings you homework for assistance, work hard &#45; and it can be work &#45; to assure that you&#39;re only assisting and not actually doing the work for her.&amp;nbsp; In moments when sloughing off occurs, send her away despite her protests.&amp;nbsp; If she returns with a different attitude, then work with her and if not, let her suffer consequences.&amp;nbsp; This even goes beyond schoolwork.&amp;nbsp; When Youngest was three years old, I took him to a playarea and he was pushed down by an older child, who was being watched by his own mother.&amp;nbsp; Youngest got up and continued playing and was then pushed down again by the same child.&amp;nbsp; He looked at me and noted that while watching, I wasn&#39;t moving; I was honestly curious as to what would happen and had decided that if occurred a third time, I would intercede.&amp;nbsp; The third time happened and just as I got up to go over to speak to the bully&#39;s mother, Youngest arose, walked over and punched him in the face.&amp;nbsp; The bully returned to his mother, I returned to my seat and Youngest returned to play.&amp;nbsp;
Fourth, understand that whining and kvetching by children isn&#39;t a sign that they won&#39;t be resilient during tough times.&amp;nbsp; Almost all children whine to one degree or another and this is a function of inexperience.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t yet understand how to process frustration, so it comes out verbally.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t yet understand that their parents can&#39;t or won&#39;t always intercede on their behalf so that their complaints are useless.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t have the experience of other difficulties against to which they can compare their present issue.&amp;nbsp; A splinter is painful, but they&#39;ve not yet encountered the longer term pain of broken bones, muscle pulls and other ailments.&amp;nbsp; Whining, while mind&#45;numbingly irritating in the moment, generally resolves with time and isn&#39;t necessarily an indication that the child will fold.
Finally, let the children suffer consequences.&amp;nbsp; If school work isn&#39;t turned in, let the grades suffer and if necessary, even impose consequences of your own.&amp;nbsp; If the child makes a poor choice with their spending money, don&#39;t intercede to pay for what they really want when they&#39;ve blown the money on something else.&amp;nbsp; Watching him suffer consequences can be a painful experience for a parent but it serves as an object lesson that Dad isn&#39;t going to always shield him from the repercussions of his (in)actions.
Developing character isn&#39;t a one&#45;off event, but instead a lengthy process.&amp;nbsp; It can be fraught with frustration and angst along with quiet conversation and praise.&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly, I&#39;m also learning that even with Eldest now in college, that character development is still occurring so my wife and I aren&#39;t off of the hook.&amp;nbsp; There are certainly other things that might occur to you to foster resilience in your children, especially since they&#39;re often so different in personality and circumstance; just stay the course and continue to work at it and hopefully, their dark place won&#39;t swallow them when they meet it.</body>

<title>What is the purpose of higher education and does it still make sense?</title>
<body>What&amp;nbsp;is the purpose of a higher education?&amp;nbsp; More importantly,&amp;nbsp;does it still make sense in today&#39;s world?
Cumulative student loans are now, at more than $1 Trillion,&amp;nbsp;larger than either credit card debt or automobile loans.&amp;nbsp; Students taking on such debt are responsible for it &#45; period &#45; as are all those who cosign for them, even retirees on fixed incomes.&amp;nbsp; If you owe it, they will come.&amp;nbsp; Yet despite this, higher education is still billed as the key necessity for entry to that promised land, the American Middle Class; the statistics are that those with the degree typically outearn those without it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But as the youngsters continue to take on debt and find themselves with minimal employment prospects to support the debtload, it&#39;s helpful for the parents &#45; who sure as hell should be having input into the decision &#45; to be clear as to why this happening.&amp;nbsp; What is the purpose of a higher education and does it make sense for my child?&amp;nbsp;
Our nation has had a love affair with higher education, even if most of its earlier citizens could never afford to attend.&amp;nbsp; The great Land Grant universities of the latter 19th century &#45; Auburn, UCal/Berkeley, Rutgers, and more than 140 other well&#45;known universities &#45; were established&amp;nbsp;under the&amp;nbsp;auspices of&amp;nbsp;congressional action to&amp;nbsp;provide research and education in improved agricultural techniques and&amp;nbsp;ensure that decent education was available to the general public; it was believed that any person would be able to better him or herself accordingly, and also become better citizens in the process.&amp;nbsp; While the majority of the populace didn&#39;t attend these institutions, their existence did increase the availability of education to the masses and sent an important message about our national values throughout the rest of the world.&amp;nbsp; Just as the establishment of the land grant universities opened the educational gates, the passage of the GI Bill in the late 1940s opened them further with the message that higher education was of value; we&#39;d reward our veterans for their service with education to help them move on with their lives and care for their families.&amp;nbsp; Education matters because an educated citizen is engaged, productive and less likely to be dependent upon the state in the long&#45;term.
Has that changed for any reason in the past twenty five years?
No.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s especially even more important today as more Americans are dependent upon the Federal government for Food Stamps and Disability Income, both of which are at all time high levels.&amp;nbsp; But these programs are fiscal outlays and their existence means that not only is there an outlay, but there&#39;s damned little chance that the user is going to be paying taxes back to the government.&amp;nbsp;
The big difference now is that there&#39;s a chasm between our words and sensibilities, and the reality of our policy actions.&amp;nbsp; As costs have risen far above even medical care costs, Catherine Rampell of the NY Times is correct that a significant portion of the cost has been shifted from the public to the individual family and student by dint of state budget cutbacks through the past twenty years.&amp;nbsp; According to the national group, the State Higher Education Executive Officers, the average state budget&#39;s contribution per Full Time Enrollment dropped in 2010 to a level last seen in 1980, adjusted to constant dollars for inflation.&amp;nbsp; The Reagan Revolution coincided with the move to the &amp;quot;knowledge based economy&amp;quot; so that when there was an increased need for higher education, we began to push the full financial demands onto the family and the youth; we forgot that government does exist to help provide certain functions for society and the nation.
It still makes sense to pursue higher education, but not in the manner that of the Boomer generation.&amp;nbsp; The presence of a sheepskin isn&#39;t an automatic guarantee of success&amp;nbsp;but the educational bar has been permanently raised so that it&#39;s more necessary than ever so greater care must be taken to craft a plan that meets the need at the minimum cost and with the minimum debt.&amp;nbsp; Parents have to truly begin paying attention to the issue and take a greater role in helping their kids determine their best route; it&#39;s irritating to read about college graduates who complain that they&#39;ve come out with a degree in Art History and $100,000 in debt.&amp;nbsp; Either they simply chose to ignore what was said or the parents had simply checked out, thinking that&amp;nbsp;after high school, they were officially adults and now officially left to their own devices.
The phrase making sense is now qualified and no longer a blanket phrase.&amp;nbsp; We have to once again focus our attention on the kids as we did when they were much younger and required greater effort.&amp;nbsp; What are their interests and skill sets?&amp;nbsp; What is their maturity level and should they spend a few more years at home now in order to avoid having to boomerang later?&amp;nbsp; What plan works best for them?&amp;nbsp; They should answer these questions, but it&#39;s up to us to ask the questions in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Only when we&#39;ve gone to the effort and through the process will we know if a higher education makes sense.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Food Prices Up, Sugar Completes the Stealth Rise</title>
<body>The data is in and compiled for the September reading of the PracticalDad Price Index and as of the most recent sampling, the cost of the 47 item grocery market basket rose to 107.5 (November 2010 = 100); strip out the ten non&#45;food items in the marketbasket and the index for the 37 food items alone rose to 111.67 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; The change from August is:
Month/Year&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Total Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;only Index
11/10&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 100&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 100

9/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 107.50&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;111.67&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Sugar completed its course&amp;nbsp;of stealth inflation through the three sampled grocery stores (all unrelated to one another with their own generic brands) as&amp;nbsp;the third generic brand&amp;nbsp;of sugar was also downsized from the standard five pound bag to a four pound bag.&amp;nbsp; As always, I&#39;ve adjusted the price per four pound bag to reflect what it would cost comparatively at five pounds to account for the&amp;nbsp;package&amp;nbsp;size decrease.
Approximately a month ago, the&amp;nbsp;New York Times ran an article forecasting food price rises due to the effects of the 2012 drought&amp;nbsp;and much of it pertained to the drought&#39;s effect upon the corn crop.&amp;nbsp; But corn isn&#39;t only used for animal feed, but also cooking oil and biofuel and the drought will also affect other crops, particularly soy and wheat and these will rattle through the economy as we move forward.&amp;nbsp; Given the level of oil prices, there will probably be a double whammy&amp;nbsp;on cooking oil as these variants are also used in biofuels which are already affected by oil and gas prices.&amp;nbsp; As sugar prices rise, despite the nominal decrease because of package downsizing, expect to see further increases in all foods which contain some degree of sugar, such as breakfast cereals, pastries and baked goods, and other dessert foods.
If there&#39;s any question about the ongoing conditions, I&#39;m writing this with a standard size (12 ounce) can of Spam next to my laptop.&amp;nbsp; The product, produced by Hormel Foods, is now celebrating its 75th anniversary and is one of the principal reasons that Hormel Foods Corporation saw strong sales growth in the last quarter.&amp;nbsp; The expiration date on the bottom of the can says Best By April 2015 and I can only presume that sales are being driven both by those who are stocking up as well as the increasing number of families on Food Stamp benefits who are seeing their protein sources slowly priced out of their range.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Should the Kids Watch the Political Conventions?</title>
<body>My biggest job as a father is to prepare the kids&amp;nbsp;for the adult world and that means exposing them to a wide variety of real world experiences.&amp;nbsp; Partner that with the civic responsibility to vote and the upshot is that it&#39;s also my responsibility to also provide a real world perspective on the American political system.&amp;nbsp; There will be conversations about the candidates through the Autumn &#45; especially with Middle&#39;s enrollment in an Honors Government/Civics course &#45; and I&#39;ll take one of the kids into the polling booth with me to see how it functions.&amp;nbsp; But should I make sure that they&#39;re able to see the purely Americana phenomenon of&amp;nbsp;a quadrennial political convention?&amp;nbsp; Is there value in letting them see the process &#45; and spectacle &#45; of a political party nominate the candidate?
The process is historic, reaching back beyond Lincoln to the now&#45;defunct Whigs and Federalists whose barbs and newspaper attacks make Fox/CNN look like child&#39;s play in comparison.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also grueling for the candidates as well as the rest of us.&amp;nbsp; Kissed babies, deep fried oreos and calloused hands combine with breathless coverage of the candidates&#39; personal lives and policy wonkery make for a truly odd experience.&amp;nbsp; The Republican nominee is offsetting his Cayman/Swiss accounts with his wife&#39;s comments on Fox News that she purchases his clothing for him at Costco while the incumbent president is trying desperately to keep his vice&#45;president from blaming the start of the Second World War on the Latvians &#45; yes, it&#39;s absurd but no more absurd than some of the other things that he&#39;s said.&amp;nbsp; But through all of the mess, the highlight of the process is the political convention, where the delegates are allocated and counted to determine the party&#39;s choice for nominee.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s hoopla and entertainment and if fortunate, some actual policy might be adopted and decisions made in the limelight, but that&#39;s only if someone somewhere has screwed up royally.
Any history buff can tell you that this is nothing new and that backroom deals have been made since the earliest days of the nation.&amp;nbsp; There have always been political brokers and bosses but with the absence of a pervasive 24/7 newsmedia, many Americans actually believed that the system worked and they had a say in the process.&amp;nbsp; But I look at the system and process now and am wildly unimpressed and cynical about the entire circus; what is the value of watching it with the kids when I believe that it exists solely as a Potemkin facade for a corrupted political process?&amp;nbsp; Am I doing my children a disservice by giving time to a political sideshow that&#39;s as rigged as the 1950&#39;s gameshow, The $64,000 Question?&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, they desperately need to understand how the process of democratic elections work and they also need to understand how each person&#39;s input should matter.&amp;nbsp; But that isn&#39;t the same thing as getting sucked into a slick sideshow designed and programmed to generate a mindless, manipulable enthusiasm.&amp;nbsp;
Why the disgust?

    The legislative branch of government utterly disregards the overwhelming opposition of the public and bails out a single sector from it&#39;s own self&#45;inflicted wounds &#45; yes, I&#39;m still on this kick.
    Two branches of government are thoroughly unable to provide even such a basic tenet of stewardship as&amp;nbsp;a functional budget.
    The government continues to fund prisons &#45; via the private sector &#45; but is unwilling or incapable of pursuing major financial fraud; there is now a de facto dual system of justice dependent solely upon one&#39;s economic status.
    The Chief Executive believes that he has the right and power to determine when an American citizen can be assassinated.
    Politicians of both sides decry spending out of one side of their mouths while promising continuing goodies out of the other side.
    Our tax code is so complex and opaque that even tax attorneys can obtain different results from the same set of financial data.
    Debate is reduced to soundbites and nastiness so that a real exchange of ideas is rendered almost impossible.

Do you want me to continue?&amp;nbsp;
Children and teens are wildly susceptible to sensational claims and comments; we&#39;ve allowed them to become so cocooned in their own electronic world that they might possess a diploma or degree but are poorly prepared for the workings of the real world.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s ultimately my responsibility to teach them about the world, I want to do it without having to compete with the programmed glitz and asshatery of the political parties which are designed purely for smoke and mirrors.&amp;nbsp; There will be conversations about the election and candidates, as there have been already and along with taking them to vote, we&#39;ll follow the election night coverage.
One convention &#45; the Republican &#45; is now in the record books and none of us turned it on.&amp;nbsp; When Romney was nominated and spoke, we watched the Food Network&#39;s Chopped.&amp;nbsp; Even though the President will speak during the Democratic convention, I guarantee that the set will either be off or turned to something else.&amp;nbsp; When the smoke has cleared, then we can have some discussions about what all of this means without the nonsense.

<title>Kids and Pot:&nbsp; Discussing the Long-Term Effects</title>
<body>Listen to the kids and teens today and one of the arguments in favor of pot smoking is that it is supposedly a harmless drug, even less damaging than alcohol.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve heard kids point to the medicinal uses for which pot is now legal in California &#45; with a doctor&#39;s script, I point out &#45; and the political/budgetary arguments that we simply can&#39;t afford to keep spending resources on the enforcement of marijuana control laws.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, they do have a point there and I&#39;ve&amp;nbsp;told the older kids that at some point in the next decade, at least one state will probably legalize marijuana &#45; and then move to tax the living hell out of it.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;m a child of the 70s and knew more than a few guys who&#39;d rather score a high than a decent grade and my sense was that it did have a long&#45;term impact on their ambition and IQ, even if I couldn&#39;t prove it.&amp;nbsp; Now there&#39;s a long&#45;term study that links IQ loss amongst adults to marijuana usage in their teens.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s not anywhere close to certain that the information would have an effect &#45; the teen battle cry is what could go wrong? &#45; it&#39;s worth a shot at sharing the information with them.
The study was a collaborative effort between Duke University and King&#39;s College London and actually began with interviews with teens back in the early 1970s in New Zealand.&amp;nbsp; Through the ensuing years, the study team kept contact with the participants and at intervals, administered&amp;nbsp;IQ tests; to further evaluate the participants, they interviewed family or friends that the participants themselves suggested.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that participants who began to regularly smoke weed in their teens suffered an eight point loss in their IQ levels by their adulthood; those who began later also suffered loss but there was some recovery in their adult years.&amp;nbsp; Given some of the kids that I knew in high school and college, this isn&#39;t a surprise.
So what to do with the information?&amp;nbsp; Short of locking teens in their rooms or homeschooling them and rigidly controlling their outside access, they&#39;ll spend considerable time out of your sight and control and you can only hope that you&#39;ve given enough information &#45; and helped build enough character &#45; that they make the right choice.

    Obviously, mention the study and show the article.&amp;nbsp; In my household, the information came via the laptop on the kitchen island during the morning kitchen routine prior to school.&amp;nbsp;
    As always, make a values statement and offer some moral component.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it&#39;s factual information but some kids need to have it placed in the context of our values; you don&#39;t have to beat them over the head and chant it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s bad!!! but some quiet commentary can be helpful.
    I don&#39;t know of any public schools that don&#39;t do random drug testing of athletes and kids involved in activities, so remind them that one blown drug test can have major repercussions on their favorite activities.
    Stay on message and be prepared to go back to it again and again and again, even when they roll their eyes at the old fart who just won&#39;t shut up about it.&amp;nbsp; Work to find new avenues to raise the issue instead of simply preaching but understand that they&#39;re actually listening.

Like many other aspects of being a parent, there are no simple and straightforward rules.&amp;nbsp; But what is necessary is the willingness to go back and revisit the issue whenever possible.&amp;nbsp; Pay attention to the media for anything that supports your stance so that it doesn&#39;t appear that it&#39;s just the old man back on the soapbox for another fun episode of meaningless redundancy.&amp;nbsp; But hang in there and keep with it, because it&#39;s certain that elements of the popular media &#45; and their peers &#45; are pushing the other side of the argument.

<title>I&#8217;m a Helicopter Parent or a Shelter Parent?</title>
<body>This past weekend was Eldest&#39;s college check&#45;in, a week earlier than most other students because she&#39;ll be playing soccer; while everything was abbreviated because of the tight schedule, the Dean of Student Life gave a brief talk to those few of us parents there, shortened from the fuller speech that he&#39;ll give next weekend at regular orientation.&amp;nbsp; While he gave out a few informational tidbits, he also spent a fair period talking about the need for parents to step back from the kids and let them find their way.&amp;nbsp; What caught my attention was that by his definition, I fit the definition of a helicopter parent.&amp;nbsp; Seriously?
The Dean&#39;s comments were that our generation of parents are reputed to be helicopter parents, who &amp;quot;hover&amp;quot; over the kids.&amp;nbsp; But in his description, our generation made it a point of attending all &#45; or most &#45; of the kids&#39; events, whether musical, theatric or sport.&amp;nbsp; He commented that his own father made it to perhaps one of his games when he himself played sports four decades ago.&amp;nbsp; But now it was time for us to step back and let the kids to care of the institution in their next phase of growing into adulthood.&amp;nbsp; While I might have misconstrued his comments &#45; doubtful &#45; what struck me was his narrow, misplaced definition of a helicopter parent.&amp;nbsp; Is it hovering to attend as many games, concerts and plays as possible or is that just part of being an engaged and active parent?&amp;nbsp; Are we actually smothering the kids by showing up consistently and repeatedly?
There is a practical and economic side to the increased attendance of today&#39;s generation versus the grandparent&#39;s generation that the Dean referenced.&amp;nbsp; Forty years ago, kids didn&#39;t have the plethora of choices available for sporting and other activities that our own children have today.&amp;nbsp; There might have been a non&#45;school related baseball or football organization, but there simply weren&#39;t the options otherwise.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s also a fear amongst today&#39;s parents that options must be made available to the kids; on the one hand, it permits them to grow and experience new activities that weren&#39;t available to us when we were younger, and there&#39;s a concern that if a kid isn&#39;t kept busy, he or she will be more likely to fall prey to the scarier aspects of unsupervised life.&amp;nbsp; So parents willingly sign the kids up.&amp;nbsp; Now comes the economic aspect &#45; with gas at high levels, the money being spent isn&#39;t going to be wasted so the folks will assure that the kids make it where they need to be and then will stay because it doesn&#39;t make sense to waste gas by leaving and then returning later.&amp;nbsp; The time spent on the road to and from the activity is literally wasted, so the thought is to make the best of things by bringing a novel, a laptop or in my case, the occasional notebook for ideas and thoughts.
What do the kids themselves want?&amp;nbsp; As I sat and made notes for this article yesterday, Youngest wandered in and asked what I was doing.&amp;nbsp; He listened and cocked his head, puzzled at the term helicopter parent; after I explained, he stated that he actually referred to them as shelter parents because their intent was to shelter their kids from any and all possible harm.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We discussed it from the standpoint of baseball &#45; his first love &#45; since his practices had started the previous evening.&amp;nbsp; Did he actually want me there and did he want me at his games?&amp;nbsp; The practice is a moot point because the field is located far enough into the countryside that I take&amp;nbsp;a passport&amp;nbsp;before leaving, but the games were a legitimate question.&amp;nbsp; He emphatically stated yeah, I like it when you see me play with the proviso that I not behave like a shelter parent.&amp;nbsp; To him, a shelter parent was one who interceded with the coach and referee when something went against the kid and when I asked about when he might be getting chewed out by the coach, he simply shook his head and commented that that was all part of it.&amp;nbsp; He referenced an incident at a ball game last year when a teammate&#39;s irate father yelled at his coach and publicly pulled the teammate from the team and dugout because the coach had reprimanded him for poking a teammate in the eye with his finger and that would certainly qualify as a shelter parent.
Youngest&#39;s term &#45; shelter parent &#45;&amp;nbsp;is actually a better description than that which is commonly used.&amp;nbsp; It more accurately describes the issue of parent and child relations and also points out that the kids aren&#39;t stupid, they really do understand there&#39;s going to be a time when they have to take a place in the world and that we won&#39;t be there, so they need to learn to deal with it.
Your kids want to have you there as much as possible.&amp;nbsp; They want to impress you and earn your respect and approval, so don&#39;t worry about what others might think about your attendance.&amp;nbsp; It might be beneficial, if they&#39;re old enough to understand, to have a talk with them about what does and doesn&#39;t embarrass them so that there are some ground rules with which both kids and parents are comfortable.&amp;nbsp; Before that point, simply accept that they want you there.
Eldest is now going to play college soccer in another state and of about 14 games on her roster, her mother and I will only be able to attend two games.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll follow the results on the college website and via&amp;nbsp;updates from her, but we won&#39;t be able to see her play as before.&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s guaranteed that in the next decade, I&#39;ll attend every baseball and volleyball game, every concert and play that is practicable because it really does come to an end and when it does, I will miss it.&amp;nbsp; And the kids will miss us if we&#39;re not there.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t hovering, it&#39;s simply being a responsible and engaged parent.

<title>Managing the Stuff:&nbsp; Lessons for the Kids</title>
<body>Life is supposed to be less hectic as the kids grow, but even with Eldest on the cusp of college, the summer passed quickly and busily.&amp;nbsp; The changes brought home &#45; with startling clarity &#45; one of the more disturbing articles read during the break, the mass of material possessions for the typical American family.&amp;nbsp; I thought, had hoped, that I was atypical but apparently I&#39;m not.
A&amp;nbsp;July article in Boston.com&amp;nbsp;pertains to a recent book published by UCLA sociologists, Life at Home in the Twenty&#45;First Century (Amazon.com).&amp;nbsp; I first became aware of the study several years ago when researching a previous article about electronics; at that time, the sociologists were reported to be spending time in 32 different&amp;nbsp; households to study how the families interacted with one another as well as the impact of technology.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, the thrust of the article was that while parents were concerned about the kids&#39; use of technology, they were ceding that ground to them because they were intimidated by it.&amp;nbsp; But what also caught their eye was the impact of the sheer amount of stuff that these families had accumulated and that finally became the basis of the linked book.
There was an eerie sense that these folks were in my own home, taping my own family as it wended through life and the myriad projects, the most disruptive of which was the room swap.&amp;nbsp; With Eldest leaving for college, she offered to swap bedrooms with Youngest; hers was the largest of the kids&#39; rooms and his was the smallest although it&#39;s become apparent that within three years, he&#39;ll physically dwarf her.&amp;nbsp; My wife&#39;s input was that along with the physical shift, each could repaint the room in a color scheme of their choice to which my thought was crap, no fourth grader is gonna paint his own room in two tones and her schedule won&#39;t permit her to paint his as well as hers...so I&#39;m on the hook for his.&amp;nbsp; Repainting a room is disruptive but controllable as furniture can be shifted to the center and covered with tarps but to actually change rooms means that at least one room of furniture is coming out to the hallway and that&#39;s what happened; however, when the furniture began to stay in the hallway, I pressed Eldest and she admitted that culling through all of her accumulated stuff was a bit overwhelming and it was after that admission that the process began to move along.&amp;nbsp; The painting on Youngest&#39;s room &#45; which would become Eldest&#39;s &#45; was complete and while her furniture was moved in, Youngest&#39;s furniture remained in the hallway until I painted his new room; even then, some items that were not going in stayed in the hallway until this morning when I finally caved in and removed them.&amp;nbsp; Furniture will stay in storage for when the kids start their own places, but the rest has gone to Goodwill or the trash.&amp;nbsp;
There any multiple reasons for the massive accumulative of kitsch, crap and stuff.&amp;nbsp;

    We&#39;ve been literally programmed and conditioned by decades of advertising that consumption is good.&amp;nbsp; After the end of the Second World War, business and political leaders made a conscious choice to push advertising that condoned and encouraged consumption.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because with the end of the war and the move by government to once again balance the books and pay off the debt &#45; quaint, isn&#39;t it? &#45; there would be no driver for business and capital investment unless the American consumer took up the slack; but they also remembered that many citizens would need a strong nudge since the collapse of the banks during the Great Depression left many literally squirreling away their cash in mattresses and under rocks across the country.&amp;nbsp; So go ahead and spend, it will demonstrate how well off you are.
    Bad news sells and an ongoing proliferation of disaster/war/collapse scenarios creates a mindset among people that they have to be prepared.&amp;nbsp; But prepared, how?&amp;nbsp; We consequently stock up on food and consumer staples that take up space and expend cash but is that really necessary?&amp;nbsp; Is it realistic to hoard tampons in anticipation of becoming a feminine products broker The Day After?&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the spectre of inflation means that people stock up now because they&#39;re conditioned that they&#39;ll have to pay more in the future.&amp;nbsp; The ongoing debate in this household is whether the number of toilet paper rolls should be in the three digit range.
    As more mothers returned to the workforce in the 1970s and afterwards, the stress on the American family rose accordingly.&amp;nbsp; The housework, laundry and cooking continues despite the job and as parents &#45; or parent, as it were &#45; stretched to perform those tasks, there was a greater willingness to buy stuff to occupy the kids so the parents could proceed accordingly; the impulse to purchase was also nudged by parental guilt for having to spend greater time away either because of work or simple exhaustion.&amp;nbsp; We&amp;nbsp;allowed the kids to anesthetize themselves so that we could anesthetize ourselves from the daily stress of living.&amp;nbsp;

The issue matters for economic and moral reasons.&amp;nbsp; Economically, the tide is turning against the American family as incomes drop for the large majority of families.&amp;nbsp; There simply isn&#39;t going to be the funding available to pay for all of these niceties and still keep a roof over the head and food on the table and if the kids don&#39;t see conscious decisions and sacrifices made, many won&#39;t be able to adjust when they enter the adult world.&amp;nbsp; Morally, the chronic consumption is oriented inwards and discourages empathy and the building of character; that requires an ability to see and live beyond oneself and if a kid is obsessed with their stuff, they won&#39;t develop that empathy and character.&amp;nbsp; The teen years are, in a sense, a time of cocooning when the child becomes an adult.&amp;nbsp; While we can&#39;t protect them from everything, we can and should try to assure that the most egregious is absent and abject materialism would certainly count as egregious.
Over the past several years, my better half has occasionally wondered why I&#39;m so into downsizing and I have to point out that it isn&#39;t downsizing, but simply trying to control the crap that&#39;s coming in and through the household.&amp;nbsp; The process will continue but I&#39;ll have to make a more concerted &#45; better &#45; effort to manage and eliminate the stuff so that the kids understand that we should be able to control it and not have it control us.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the lesson will be repeated again and again that these things require money that could be better used elsewhere instead of enriching some retailer.
I fear that our society&#39;s children will be faced with choices that we never had to make.&amp;nbsp; While I can&#39;t protect them from those choices, I can work now to lessen the pain of the repercussions when that time arrives.</body>

<title>History Rhymes:&nbsp; A Reading List for Economic Change (TakeTwo)</title>
<body>PracticalDad Note:&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a reason that I don&#39;t do much writing when the kids are around and things are hopping.&amp;nbsp; In this instance, I looked up as everyone cheered for an American Olympic gymnast and bang! I&#39;d inadvertantly hit the key that posted the previous incomplete article to the site and RSS...so here&#39;s the second effort at the article.&amp;nbsp; My apologies.
History doesn&#39;t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Mark Twain
It&#39;s been five years since the start of the global credit crisis, which has morphed and metastisized from a bunch of over&#45;leveraged homebuilders and mortgage lenders to nations seeking bailouts and the potential collapse of a multinational political union and currency.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve witnessed multiple scandals that don&#39;t seem to scandalize and an alphabet soup of European acronyms; but while there are excellent websites to keep tabs on the ongoing trainwreck, it&#39;s difficult to understand events in any kind of historical context.
Historical context?&amp;nbsp; Seriously?
Fiat currency, regulatory capture, gold standard, widespread corruption...these are not new instances and their reoccurrence simply gives the lie to the nonsensical notion that history ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union.&amp;nbsp; Twain was correct when he noted that history might not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, it&#39;s helpful to have a sense of where we&#39;ve been before to gain an insight to where we might have to go again.&amp;nbsp; If you have some time for reading, I&#39;d suggest the following series of books that&amp;nbsp;would provide a good overview of that particular topic.
The Money Men (H.W. Brand, 2006) &#45; This is a good overview and relatively easy read for the start as it touches upon five Americans who were intimately involved in the finances of the country through its first hundred and fifty years.&amp;nbsp; Commencing with Alexander Hamilton, it examines the roles of the trailblazer (Jay Cooke), the crooked (Jay Gould), the rescuer (J.P. Morgan)&amp;nbsp;and the power&#45;hungry (Nicholas Biddle).&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s particularly the conflict that arose between Jackson and Biddle&#39;s Bank of the United States that highlights the ongoing tension between and a democracy and the monied interests.&amp;nbsp; The present day upshot of that story, which culminated in the Panic and Depression of 1837, is that resolutions are sometimes painful with much collateral damage.
The Robber Barons (Matthew Josephson, 1973) &#45; Josephson&#39;s book looks at the usual cluster of industrialists and financiers from the legally unfettered Gilded Age of the late 19th century (Carnegie, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Jay Cooke) and introduces you to others, such as Daniel Drew, who was a master at manipulating the stock market and particularly enjoyed taking advantage of economic upheaval (There&#39;s good fishing in troubled waters).&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s interesting as you read is to consider how many of these names are also now the names of colleges and universities.
The Panic of 1907 (Robert Bruner and Sean Carr, 2009) &#45; As economic chaos goes, this wasn&#39;t a particularly terrible blow to the entire economy and scarring was contained to the financial and banking sector as it arose from bank overleveraging and speculation.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s notable about this event however, is that it set the stage for the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 as politicians and bankers realized that there really was a need for a central bank to act as the lender of last resorts for the national banking system.&amp;nbsp; In this particular instance, the banker of last resorts was J Pierpoint Morgan (you&#39;ll remember him from The Robber Barons).&amp;nbsp; In a series of episodes akin to what we&#39;d consider a situation comedy, Morgan provided nighttime wagon loads of cash to meet the demand of panicking depositors when the doors of selected institutions opened the next morning.&amp;nbsp; How did he decide what banks were worthy of the money?&amp;nbsp; By sending in his trusted lieutenant, Benjamin Strong, to evaluate the banks&#39; books through the night before and if Strong gave the thumbs up to Morgan, the wagons would be dispatched.&amp;nbsp; Thumbs down?&amp;nbsp; Those institutions died like defeated gladiators.&amp;nbsp; Had Morgan not acted, the episode would have left a much greater dent in the economy.
The Lords of Finance (Liaquat Ahamed, 2009) &#45; This centers upon the four principal central bankers &#45; French, American, British and German &#45; of the tumultuous first quarter of the 20th century.&amp;nbsp; It examines the personalities of the four, including American Benjamin Strong (from The Panic of 1907) and the efforts of the four to manage their respective currencies through the chaos of that period.&amp;nbsp; There are two topics of particular interest to today: first, the role of gold as a backing to a particular currency and the effect of managing a currency without having a solid standard of value to anchor it; second is the tragedy of Weimar Germany, which opted to devalue the Deutschmark as a means of addressing a crushing national debt.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that our own period is bound for hyperinflation, but it&#39;s certainly instructive in the lessons.
The Big Short (Michael Lewis, 2010) &#45; Michael Lewis has a gift for telling a story, for getting to the essence of something and making it understandable to a layperson and that&#39;s precisely what he&#39;s done with the heart of the financial crisis.&amp;nbsp; This is the book that explains how the financial crisis of 2008 was born, and borne, within an obscure, opaque financial product that was marketed to the global community.&amp;nbsp; It lays out the collapse of ethical standards and the unbelievable myopia of a financial community that truly drank it&#39;s own Kool Aid before hitting the skids in late 2007.&amp;nbsp; This is the one book that I&#39;ve both given and suggested to others because it&#39;s the keystone to understanding the mechanism in layman&#39;s terms.&amp;nbsp;
House of Cards (William Cohan, 2010) &#45; Before Lehman Brothers went down in 2008, the financial community got a foretaste of what was to come with the collapse of Wall Street firm Bear Stearns.&amp;nbsp; It starts with the events of the firm&#39;s last several days before it&#39;s purchase by JP Morgan Chase for $2 a share (at one point within the previous two years, it had traded at over $170/share) and then shifts backwards to explain how it got to that point.&amp;nbsp; The ultimate lessons are (1) what happens when a firm is too highly levered by debt as it chases performance, and (2) what happens when the assets (as explained in Lewis&#39; The Big Short) are so opaque and illiquid that they are almost impossible to value and sell.&amp;nbsp;
Econned (Yves Smith, 2010) &#45; Yves Smith is the nom de blog for a retired Wall Street executive who began chronicling the absurdities and excesses of the financial system in her website Naked Capitalism.&amp;nbsp; Smith lays out the changes in the Economics field and how the practitioners and academicians successfully managed to sell a soft science (psychology based) center wrapped in a hard science shell starting in the middle of the 20th century so that they became the priests of the financial and monetary field.&amp;nbsp; When they became the unchallenged priests by the end of the 20th century, the stage was set for decisions that fit well into a theoretical realm but horribly in the actual world in which we live.lin
With kids, who has the time to read this stuff anyway?&amp;nbsp; If I&#39;m going to be a good father, I can&#39;t spend my time engrossed in reading unless it&#39;s with Junior and Goodnight Moon or Peter Pan, right?&amp;nbsp;
The truth is that these are books that I&#39;ve read over the course of late nights for the past several years and they&#39;ve gone a far way to helping gain a grasp on what all of this means.&amp;nbsp; My recommendation for the best start is to attack Lewis&#39; The Big Short for a synopsis of the product and spread throughout the global community.&amp;nbsp; Then go back to Brand&#39;s The Money Men with special emphasis upon the section for Nicholas Biddle, who led the Second Bank of the United States when it clashed with Andrew Jackson in the 1830s; this is a foretaste of the same issue that we face today as the monied interests line up to control the political system in which the rest of us live.
I would say happy reading, but there&#39;s nothing happy about it.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; August 2012</title>
<body>With the drought continuing across the US&amp;nbsp;and affecting the corn and &#45; probably &#45; soy supplies, the word is out to expect an increase of about 3% in food prices in the next year.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m not certain, it sounds as though they assume that there will be no other food increases apart from what&#39;s happening to the national crop because of the drought.&amp;nbsp; That unfortunately isn&#39;t the case as food continues to rise.
The results of the August 2012 basket pricing of 47 items showed that the full index declined slightly to 106.68 from July&#39;s level of 106.77 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; When you strip out the ten non&#45;food components of the grocery basket however, the food&#45;only index rose from July&#39;s 110.32 to August&#39;s 110.88 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp;
While there&#39;s always some give and take, especially due to seasonality, amongst the food prices, what was notable was an 8.8% rise in the cost of Red Delicious Apples (3# bag)&amp;nbsp;and and a 10% rise in the cost of a can of Dark Red Kidney Beans.&amp;nbsp; In each case, one of the three stores suddenly showed a price spike which drove the average cost upwards and I anticipate that there will be some followup amongst at least one of the other two stores in the next several months.&amp;nbsp; This is indeed the case for the stealth inflationary packaging of sugar, which has now had a second store decrease the standard size bag from 5 to 4 pounds.&amp;nbsp; While there&#39;s a nominal price decrease, the real effect is an increase in the cost of sugar as the consumer will have to purchase more or cut back use accordingly to make a bag of sugar last the same time span.
The results of the non&#45;food/food indices at three month intervals are shown below.

<title>Comments on the First Tuition Bill</title>
<body>Readers know that I have three children &#45; Eldest, Middle and Youngest &#45; and as it usually happens, life changes.&amp;nbsp; In this case, it changes because Eldest is moving off to college in a month and if the proliferation of empty boxes awaiting use didn&#39;t bring that home, the arrival of the first tuition bill did.&amp;nbsp; Within a one week span of the bill&#39;s arrival, she also received other correspondence offering student loans and if I didn&#39;t know better, I&#39;d almost think that it was serendipity that such mail would arrive in such a timely fashion.&amp;nbsp; What went through my mind in the moment and afterwards?
First was the simple realization that the bill was addressed to The Parents of...&amp;nbsp; While she&#39;s now eighteen and nominally an adult &#45; are our high school graduates truly adults (hmmm, there&#39;s a question) &#45; the money enchilada comes back to us.&amp;nbsp; This was especially interesting since we learned at parent orientation weekend that the institution could only send us report cards for the first two years unless the offspring signs a permission form allowing them to do for the final two or so years.&amp;nbsp; At least we&#39;re clear that our role in the eyes of the college establishment monolith is that of a financial donkey.
Second, the simple question when did this happen?&amp;nbsp; My flashback was to a two&#45;year old toddler posing for a picture on her first day of preschool, a small blue tote bag slung over shoulders wearing a bright yellow play shirt, face framed by fine brown hair cut in a page&#45;boy&amp;nbsp;style.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;At that moment, she was an only child and in the intervening years would be&amp;nbsp;joined by her two younger&amp;nbsp;brothers.&amp;nbsp; That question was followed by a momentary panic with such&amp;nbsp;questions as have we done enough? and could I have done a better job of investing what was saved?&amp;nbsp; The pit&#45;of&#45;the&#45;stomach queasiness was only made worse when I tore off the computer envelope tabs and looked at the dollar figure for the first semester.&amp;nbsp; Despite the fact that I&#39;ve run the numbers and knew what they already were, the emotions exploded out of the box like a knife&#45;wielding, meth&#45;addicted jack&#45;in&#45;the&#45;box.&amp;nbsp;
Third, despite having run all of the numbers ahead of time, actually looking at the amount of the first bill was a gut&#45;checking experience and especially since the dollar figure in the amount due box was significantly less than what I expected.&amp;nbsp; My family knows that when truly surprised, my standard response is what the hell? with the register dropping on the second word and then rising &#45; along with a crescendo &#45; on the word hell.&amp;nbsp; After momentary confusion, I found that the difference was accounted by the school&#39;s assumption that some of the money was coming from a federal direct unsubsidized loan despite our never telling them that that was what we&#39;d be doing.&amp;nbsp; The college financial aid office explained that their bills automatically include that and I had to specify that our intent was to handle this without debt, although circumstances with two other kids might force a future change.&amp;nbsp; It bothers me that the institutions continue to raise the costs with the expectations that the families and kids are having to incur even more debt.&amp;nbsp; While some increases are expected, the fact that the past two decades of rises have far outstripped family incomes.&amp;nbsp; It all comes back to the fact that higher education is a big business; if you don&#39;t believe it, consider that student debt is now higher than credit card debt or auto loans.
Fourth, within days of the tuition bill&#39;s arrival, Eldest received separate credit offers from Sallie Mae&amp;nbsp;and Citibank.&amp;nbsp; Sallie Mae&#39;s offer openly played to the emotions with the line that time was running out for a loan before the start of the school year but they&#39;d sweeten their offer with some manner of free credit insurance for a period of time.&amp;nbsp; Citibank&#39;s offer was more bland but again, the timing was supposedly serendipitous.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, if you&#39;re faced with the prospect of having to take on tens of thousands of dollars, you shouldn&#39;t be rushed into it and kids can simply be tricked into the sense that it&#39;s now or never.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The matter should be approached in such a manner that the prospect of a Sallie Mae letter is irrelevant and can be directed immediately into the trash and teens/nascent adults don&#39;t have the perspective and experience to realize it.
Fifth, now that the bill is here, what is the mechanism for drawing money from the 529 to cover this?&amp;nbsp; Money has been plunked there periodically for years but what has to happen to actually get it out in a timely fashion?&amp;nbsp; By now, Eldest knows that the bill is certainly here and has to be covered by a certain date and this presents a learning moment in how to handle processing.&amp;nbsp; The question was answered in a few minutes and she walked through the withdrawal paperwork with me so that she could see what was involved.&amp;nbsp; Can she do it going forward?&amp;nbsp; No, since it&#39;s in my name as her custodian but it&#39;s helpful for her to see the background structure, something about which the great mass of kids are woefully unaware.
The process is now in motion and the bill filed away until mid&#45;August.&amp;nbsp; Now it&#39;s time for her to cull and gather and fill those boxes for the trip out.&amp;nbsp; And then, the reality will sink in again.

<title>Finishing the Project - Kids and Incentives</title>
<body>When we purchased our present home in 2007, we found that the yard&amp;nbsp; was a high&#45;maintenance affair with a do&#45;it&#45;yourself pond already installed.&amp;nbsp; After a fish&#45;killing algae bloom in 2009, we began a major yard renovation&amp;nbsp;project to both refurbish the pond and tear out almost 800 square feet of out&#45;of&#45;control periwinkle.&amp;nbsp; Since we&#39;d had a quote of over $5000 to redo the pond, we thought that we could do it cheaper (a win) and instill some entrepreneurial drive in the older kids (For the Win!).&amp;nbsp; Since beginning the project in 2010, its end is now within sight and I&#39;ve had to look back to see what I&#39;d do differently.

    First, don&#39;t let the kids determine the pace of the project.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll grant that it&#39;s been a long &#45; loooong &#45; project tearing out hundreds of square feet of overgrown myrtle, landscaping the first half, installing a two&#45;tier vegetable garden and mucking with a dying fish pond.&amp;nbsp; The intent was to do the work and let the kids do a large amount of the grunt labor within the context of the usual summer activities, prompted by good old greed.&amp;nbsp; But I miscalculated on the variety and time constraints of the activities and things lagged.
    Second, I simply didn&#39;t realize that the bulk of this is pure stoop, grunt labor and that the kids aren&#39;t interested in hours and hours of grunt labor.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;d do some work but with the interspersal of activities, it was never enough to gain critical mass.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;d become concerned that there was laziness that didn&#39;t bode well for the future, especially on Eldest&#39;s part, her subsequent part&#45;time job has reassured me that she&#39;s got a decent work ethic.
    Third, the kids aren&#39;t just going to go outside and work unless I prompt and actually join in, and set the example.&amp;nbsp; When I was there, it went better than when it didn&#39;t.
    Fourth, I discounted Youngest, who&#39;s now old enough to put in the physical work and has actually proven to be more reliable and motivated than his older siblings.&amp;nbsp;
    Finally, there&#39;s something to be said for simply saying let&#39;s get this done and be finished with it and making it a priority ahead of other work.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something that I should have done last summer.

But had I done that, Youngest wouldn&#39;t have made the money that he&#39;s made thus far.
So for now, the last segment of the new waterfall awaits and then &#45; then &#45; we can actually enjoy the backyard.</body>

<title>What is LIBOR and What&#8217;s the Deal?</title>
<body>There&#39;s a growing brouhaha in England and heads in the banking sector there have already begun to roll.&amp;nbsp; It has nothing to do with hookers or rogue traders that spend the company dime on cocaine futures; rather, it pertains to something as innocuous as the financial equivalent of a screw, an interest rate called LIBOR, which like a screw serves as an underpinning to a large portion of the global financial structure.&amp;nbsp; While the action is in England, the effects are felt here as LIBOR is used in financial instruments in the US and the reality is that there are American banks which contribute to the determination of LIBOR.&amp;nbsp; Did they participate?
What is LIBOR
When most people think of banks, they think that the institutions are free&#45;standing entities that compete with one another for business with minimal interaction; any additional funding needs can be achieved via working through the Federal Reserve System (although the sense is that things are pretty bad if that&#39;s the case).&amp;nbsp; For the smaller banks, this is par but&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;larger banks &#45; especially those deemed Too Big To Fail &#45; have daily funding and liquidity needs that outstrip what they have on hand.&amp;nbsp; These banks consequently interact with one another each day and those with extra will lend to the other institutions at a very small rate, small because these lending institutions expect to have the money back very soon and also because they know with whom they&#39;re dealing.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, the rate that these institutions charge one another is exceptionally low and requires no collateral for the extremely short duration.&amp;nbsp; LIBOR &#45; London InterBank Operating Rate &#45; is the name of this rate.
LIBOR came about because of a nudge from the British Banking Association in the mid&#45;1980s.&amp;nbsp; With the introduction of a wide range of new and complex products &#45; adjustable/variable rate mortgages, interest rate swaps, and other goodies &#45; in the early 1980s, it became apparent that there had to be a common rate upon which&amp;nbsp;the various products could be based&amp;nbsp;else&amp;nbsp;for contractual purposes.&amp;nbsp; Because London continued to be home to a significant part of the global financial community, the BBA pushed the financial community to develop such a uniform rate and LIBOR was born, taking effect in 1986.&amp;nbsp; Understand that while the name implies a solely British scale, the actual LIBOR rate is determined by the responses by only a handful of banks from the international community and is updated daily.&amp;nbsp; These daily rates are then used in an immense number of financial contracts occuring globally as the reference point for the payments that pass from one party to the other.&amp;nbsp; How immense?&amp;nbsp; The cumulative financial value of the contracts with some input from LIBOR are in the hundreds of trillions of dollars &#45; that&#39;s Trillions, with a T.
What&#39;s the issue with LIBOR?
The issue with LIBOR, and it&#39;s so far claimed the top three executives of Barclays Bank &#45; a major international bank based in Britain &#45; is that it&#39;s become clear that the daily rate has been gamed by at least several of the banks.&amp;nbsp; The member banks are expected to report a particular rate each day based upon their best estimate, but Barclays is the first to have been found to have underreported what their rate would be in order to do favors for other institutions; this means that the true rate of interest is actually higher than the artificially low rates reported as the official LIBOR rate for that day.&amp;nbsp; The difference is unknown at present and would depend upon how many member banks colluded in the rate reports and to what extent was the level of underreporting.&amp;nbsp; For each of those days affected, any number of variable rate mortgages and other rate&#45;sensitive contracts, would be consequently affected.&amp;nbsp;
The CEO of Barclays, Bob Diamond, recently testified before a Parliamentary Committee regarding the LIBOR scandal.&amp;nbsp; His testimony was Barclays actually&amp;nbsp;was pressured to do so by&amp;nbsp;the Bank of England, the equivalent of the English Fed; but the note to file after the BoE/Barclays conversation not only supports his claim, but unequivocably states that not only were other banks rigging their LIBOR submissions, but that the BoE knew of it and wanted Barclays to fall in line with the other rigging banks.&amp;nbsp; The old saw is that prisons are full of innocent men and given our present who ya gonna believe environment, there will be questions as to the veracity of the note.&amp;nbsp; But the damage is done as there&#39;s a strong discrediting of the entire financial establishment, profit and regulatory alike.
So long as LIBOR is now under suspicion, there&#39;s now a pall over the use of many of these products.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a true impact on rate sensitive contracts in the works but not yet signed.&amp;nbsp; Is this truly the real rate or is it rigged?&amp;nbsp; Is there some other rate standard that can be used in it&#39;s stead and how dependable is it?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There&#39;s a potential impact on mortgages as lenders slow down lending to&amp;nbsp;see how this plays out and families waiting for word on whether they will be able to purchase a home.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The monthly nut for&amp;nbsp;the difference of 3/4 of point in a mortgage rate can be in the&amp;nbsp;hundreds of dollars, so what does this do to home sales?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;One of the other great losers in this episode are the various non&#45;profit and governmental entities that might engage in interest rate swaps to help control the cost of capital projects.&amp;nbsp; Will needed infrastructure projects &#45; bridges, sewer treatment plants, road work &#45; be able to move forward or will they&amp;nbsp;have to be shelved?&amp;nbsp; With Stockton, California now in bankruptcy and other entities &#45; Detroit, Harrisburg, Jefferson County, Alabama &#45; as poster children for fiscal disaster, how will necessary work move forward?&amp;nbsp;
This is simply for the world moving forward and says nothing about the rate sensitive contracts that are already in place.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, if I had an interest rate swap and heard this news, I&#39;d pull the paperwork and review it in a much more skeptical light with an eye towards litigation.
Why is this a big deal?
The implications of a&amp;nbsp;rigged baseline reference point are massive.
The LIBOR rate is a global reference point, much as the gram is a standard for determining mass or the gallon for measuring volume.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But unlike the gram and gallon, there is no true governmental oversight for the protection of the LIBOR rate; the English government essentially let the determination of this global standard to an insular&amp;nbsp;financial industries community that put itself ahead of the common good.&amp;nbsp;
If you want a comparison, suppose that governments failed to inspect and regulate gasoline pumps but let the maintenance and standardization of those pumps fall solely to the oil companies?&amp;nbsp; What would you think if you were paying for 20 gallons of gas each week but were in reality only getting 17 gallons in your tank?&amp;nbsp; Would you be angry with Exxon&#45;Mobil or BP for abusing your trust, let alone your wallet?
What would you think if Otis Elevator purposefully used defective materials in the production and installation of elevators?&amp;nbsp;
What would be your response if you found a roach in your&amp;nbsp;kid&#39;s Happy Meal and then found that the local health department had suspended restaurant inspections because they considered the&amp;nbsp;folks at McDonalds&amp;nbsp;to be okey&#45;dokey&amp;nbsp;100% upright citizens?
When&amp;nbsp;your roller&#45;coaster car went barreling off the rails on that last hair&#45;pin turn, would your last thought &#45; before your brain splattered against the pavement &#45; be to curse the state for not inspecting the ride before it opened?
What would you think if you found that your hoped&#45;for home, in the neighborhood with the school you want for your kid, was suddenly unaffordable because your lender had to adjust the rate on the prospective loan to account for a gamed LIBOR reference rate?&amp;nbsp; What if they simply&amp;nbsp;became&amp;nbsp;Loan Nazis and said no loan for you!&amp;nbsp;
These examples don&#39;t mean that I have a blanket distrust of business, at least not Otis.&amp;nbsp; But each of these areas are under public regulation and inspection because there&#39;s a long history that demonstrates that companies and individuals can prefer private gain over the common good, even to the point of death.&amp;nbsp; In each of these industries referenced, there wasn&#39;t some uniform inspection and enforcement mechanism simultaneously enacted in a piece of blanket legislation; the regulatory oversight was created on an as&#45;needed basis and that need was usually prompted by some scandal involving death, serious threat to the public welfare&amp;nbsp;or serious financial loss.&amp;nbsp;
No one has died, but there&#39;s damage nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; The losses put to the public treasury are already&amp;nbsp;in the trillions of dollars and these losses detract from more important uses, let alone the knowledge that we&#39;re mortgaging our grandkids&#39; future with the debt.&amp;nbsp; The failure of the fiduciary component of the financial industry has allowed self&#45;interested bankers to plunder their clients&#39; savings.&amp;nbsp; The failure of the fiduciary component has allowed the banks to wholesale gamble with their capital, knowing that any failure would be made good by the public trough.&amp;nbsp; If you aren&#39;t certain of this, consider the recent issue regarding JP Morgan Chase&#39;s $9 Billion screwup that led to their CEO&#39;s appearance before Congress.&amp;nbsp; While the drama is on in Britain, the problem doesn&#39;t lie solely with the English government.&amp;nbsp; This is a pointed example of what occurs when oversight and regulation ceases and people with signficant incentives to cheat are left to their own devices and it happens in the US just as it does in other western nations.&amp;nbsp; The US deregulated the financial services industry in the 1990s and the result since then has been an ongoing parade of unethical and sometimes illegal behavior in the time since.&amp;nbsp;
Planes aren&#39;t falling from the skies nor are bridges collapsing as a result of this particular episode.&amp;nbsp; But the banks have still tampered with the screws that hold the financial structure together and when that structure finally goes, the suffering will be immense.&amp;nbsp; If you aren&#39;t certain, just look at the generational scars left by the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; There is an occasional thought that nags at the back of my mind however.&amp;nbsp; The view of the government&#39;s role before the Great Depression is one of benign neglect as it permitted Laissez Faire capitalism to run it&#39;s course...
...what would&amp;nbsp;our society&amp;nbsp;be like if government was known to have taken an active role in promoting and facilitating the excesses of the late 1920s?

<title>The Return of Postum:&nbsp; PracticalDad Price Index - July 2012</title>
<body>One of the concepts that Econ 101 students learn is that of the inferior good, which isn&#39;t actually a comment upon the quality but rather it&#39;s affordability versus other goods.&amp;nbsp; In other words, an inferior good is one that&#39;s used to replace a more expensive or unavailable one when times get tough; Spam is a classic example as sales generally rise during periods of economic downturn and folks move away from more expensive meats to make the budget work.&amp;nbsp; When times improve, then the sales scale back accordingly.&amp;nbsp; In today&#39;s environment of rising food prices, Postum would be such an example of an inferior good.
Postum was created by CW Post in the 1890s as an alternative to coffee, which he disliked because of the caffeine content.&amp;nbsp; In it&#39;s life &#45; it was finally discontinued by owner Kraft Foods in 2007 &#45; the formula was basically toasted grains mixed with molasses.&amp;nbsp; Although it didn&#39;t taste like coffee nor was it billed as a coffee substitute, Postum sales skyrocketed in the World War II years as real coffee was rationed and millions of Americans shifted to Postum in lieu of the bean.&amp;nbsp; My own recollection is that it resided in my grandmother&#39;s cabinet and I recalled seeing the bottles in out&#45;of&#45;the&#45;way sections of the coffee aisle shelves until they simply vanished.&amp;nbsp; America&#39;s love affair with coffee has flourished and one of our most expansive corporations revolves around setting up coffee shops; we have no concern with caffeine as our youngsters swig Mountain Dew and the teens graduate to Monster, Venom or Rock Star.&amp;nbsp; Postum simply couldn&#39;t compete.
But Postum will be making a comeback&amp;nbsp;in the near future courtesy of former drinkers who bought the trademark and did the formulary work to get the taste right.&amp;nbsp; There are certainly going to be those who drink it for the taste but I suspect that others will try it as an alternative to coffee for reasons of cost.&amp;nbsp; When the PracticalDad Price Index began in November 2010, the cost of a 13 ounce store&#45;brand caffeinated coffee can was $2.96; had the packages not been downsized to either 11 or 11.3 ounces, the equivalent cost would be $4.43 for the same 13 ounce can &#45; an almost 50% rise in only 20 months if you account for the downsizing.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re paying less for a can of coffee than the average here, it&#39;s probably because that can is less than the old standard 13 ounce can.&amp;nbsp;
What happened with the marketbasket from June to July 2012?&amp;nbsp; The index level increased again&amp;nbsp;from June&#39;s 106.49 to 106.77 (November 2010 &#45; 100.00) so that the cost for the basket is 6.77% higher than November 2010; looking in prices for the food component of the basket alone &#45; 37 of 47 total items &#45; the index rose to 110.32, more than half again as high as the full component.&amp;nbsp;
As much as I love coffee, I probably will try a cup of Postum when it returns.</body>

<title>Redefining Fatherhood - A Response</title>
<body>This site&#39;s&amp;nbsp;Father&#39;s Day article&amp;nbsp;asked the question what is the role of the father?&amp;nbsp; There have been huge changes affecting fatherhood and the family in the past four decades and as is typically the case, the structure has been badly outpaced by events and trends.&amp;nbsp; As families have struggled with the upheaval, attention has turned periodically in the press to&amp;nbsp;the attempts to cope; with women now heavily in the workforce, the question has generally been asked as how much housework and childcare is the father doing to assist the mother.&amp;nbsp; Is Dad doing enough in the household to help Mom?&amp;nbsp; How much time is spent on dusting and childcare activities to make life easier for Mom, who&#39;s also now in the workforce?
On one level, those are entirely appropriate questions.&amp;nbsp; Caring for, and raising, children is hard work; it&#39;s physically intense when they&#39;re younger and more intellectually and emotionally intense when they age and move out to interact with the world.&amp;nbsp; But the undertone of the conversation is that&amp;nbsp;Dad is the junior partner in terms of the parenting with the bulk of the real power in the hands of Mom, who&#39;s more qualified and capable&amp;nbsp;of managing the kids.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This isn&#39;t just a&amp;nbsp;media perception either, but one that&amp;nbsp;men themselves have stated in the media.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s&amp;nbsp;saddening to read&amp;nbsp;the comments of fathers in national publications that I&#39;m just&amp;nbsp;watching the kids until their mother gets home and&amp;nbsp;the kids are my boss, I work for them.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, the kids are your boss and you work for them?&amp;nbsp; Sweet Jesus, that&#39;s the kind of&amp;nbsp;scenario played out in comic books in which the Joker is somehow made warden of Arkham Asylum.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While I no longer listen to Limbaugh, he is right when he states that words have meaning and while that father meant that he worked in the household on their behalf, the wording leaves one with the sense that many fathers view themselves as the junior member of the parenting partnership.&amp;nbsp; Bucky, the sidekick parent.&amp;nbsp;
In the main, most mothers do have innate insights into their kids&#39; heads and feelings that most fathers don&#39;t, and probably never will.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the best description of a mother&#39;s insight was penned by JM Barrie in the first chapter of Peter Pan:
Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children&#39;s minds.&amp;nbsp; It is the nightly custom of every good mother&amp;nbsp;after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for the next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.&amp;nbsp; If you could keep awake (but of course you can&#39;t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her.&amp;nbsp; It is quite like tidying up drawers.&amp;nbsp; You would see her on knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.
It&#39;s lovely writing but in the language of the twitter generation, Moms are generally better at getting inside the heads than Dads.
So what is our role?&amp;nbsp;
I&#39;m trying to not sound sexist, but while women are better turning inwards to the family, I believe that men are generally better at facing outwards, towards the world.&amp;nbsp; When the kids were very little, I believed that my first and foremost job was to not only care for them, but protect them.&amp;nbsp; They were incapable of handling whatever was out there and it was my job to assure that&amp;nbsp;no harm came to them.&amp;nbsp; But as they grew and moved out into the world, the physical aspect lessened but the sense did not.&amp;nbsp; My job was to prepare them as much as I could &#45; and they were willing &#45; for life in the world.&amp;nbsp; My job as a father is to teach them not only about the world but also, and more importantly, how to handle what came their way.&amp;nbsp; This could be done via conversations but also by example and behavior.&amp;nbsp; How do you handle people who might come to the front door?&amp;nbsp; What do you need to remember about handling money matters with salespeople and others?&amp;nbsp; Are there situations that you and the kids witness that need to be discussed?&amp;nbsp; For example, my wife and I were taking the kids to a summer evening event in a nearby city and as we drove down a street, saw a man &#45; surrounded by others &#45; beating another man.&amp;nbsp; As my wife dialed 911 from the cellphone, I wheeled the car up a side street and away from the fight.&amp;nbsp;
Why didn&#39;t you stop?&amp;nbsp; Why didn&#39;t you help the guy?&amp;nbsp;
Because I&#39;m in a car with three children, the oldest in middle school and there are a number of people surrounding this fight.&amp;nbsp; Why aren&#39;t they stepping in&amp;nbsp;and am I creating more issues by trying to intercede?&amp;nbsp; What happens if I&#39;m outnumbered and the disturbance shifts to our car?&amp;nbsp; Courage is important but smart is even more so.&amp;nbsp;
Our world is an unfriendly place and it&#39;s only becoming moreso.&amp;nbsp; Behaviors have grown more callous and crude and if there&#39;s nobody to teach kids how to respond to unpleasant people and situations, then the potential for more problems rises.&amp;nbsp; Not only is our world increasingly unfriendly, it&#39;s increasingly complex.&amp;nbsp; Kids might be technological whizzes, but they&#39;ve so immersed themselves in their electronics that they pay no attention to the actual workings of the world.&amp;nbsp; Turning in a job application is only the first step in the process.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Have you actually asked somebody for&amp;nbsp;a reference before they get a phone call from a potential employer?&amp;nbsp; When and how are you going to follow up?&amp;nbsp; What do you think that you&#39;re going to&amp;nbsp;say?&amp;nbsp; If you want to go to the beach after graduation, where do you plan to stay?&amp;nbsp; Is there a contract that you have to&amp;nbsp;sign and more importantly, have you read it?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Situations and circumstances in the outside world can certainly be handled by women, but there are moments when a male presence makes a difference and it&#39;s important for the kids to see how.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case for boys, who desperately need a stable male presence to provide a model for manhood.
So what is our role?
Prepare them for the world.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Educate them.&amp;nbsp; Search out and seize teachable moments at all ages, whether it&#39;s pointing out how a helicopter is like a hummingbird, how to handle a bully or change the tire on a car and bicycle.&amp;nbsp; Do your best to manage yourself in tense situations so that they have a model on which to build their own behavior when older.&amp;nbsp; Explain the world to them at every opportunity, talk to them, chat with them and reinforce your core values and beliefs whenever possible.&amp;nbsp; Understand that even when you aren&#39;t overtly teaching, they are watching you intently and learning as they go.&amp;nbsp;
All of the other stuff &#45; housework and childcare &#45; matters greatly as it&#39;s upon this mundane minutiae that households are given form and structure and turned into homes.&amp;nbsp; The women in your lives deserve your support and they in turn owe you likewise; just remember however, that raising children should be a partnership between mother and father and the best partnerships are built among equals with neither one being junior to the other.
Generations move forward through time.&amp;nbsp; When the children are youngest, they&#39;ll be behind you for their protection.&amp;nbsp; As they grow, they&#39;ll learn to take a place at your side and when they&#39;re adults, they&#39;ll advance ahead of you into a new world of their own with its own trials and pleasures.&amp;nbsp; And when they become parents, the cycle will continue anew as they protect their little ones standing behind them.

<title>How Far To Take the Lessons?</title>
<body>The American Family is now in the process of finding its way to a new normal as the rising consumption pattern of the past 50 years meets the declining income pattern of the past decade.&amp;nbsp; While there&#39;s cyclicality to the economy, it&#39;s dawning on us that what&#39;s occurring now is not cyclical but structural, as the American economy finally gives way to the consequences of errant policy decisions and global competition.&amp;nbsp; Parents have to now consider what they can actually afford as they balance the costs of raising children with the realities of preparing for the future in a fiscally&#45;constrained society.&amp;nbsp; This particular point is brought home in the present question in my mind &#45; if a child has a non&#45;scholastic interest in something, what is the value of private lessons and how far should those lessons&amp;nbsp;be taken?
One of the keynotes of the employment picture in the past two years is the rise of the part&#45;time job in lieu of full&#45;time employment.&amp;nbsp; Young adults are graduating college with iffy job prospects and certain debt while more than a few middle&#45;aged folks are suddenly finding themselves out of work as well.&amp;nbsp; Teen unemployment is high as the kids are caught between traditional jobs now being handled by adults and child&#45;labor laws that restrict what employers are willing to offer.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s cropped up more noticeably on my radar, especially in terms of sports, are the personal coaches who are happy to work with the kids at a rate of $35/hour or higher, if there&#39;s an actual facility involved.&amp;nbsp; This supplements the traditional realm of the music teacher, who historically taught the child instrumental or vocal music.&amp;nbsp; As more people are stretching to figure out ways to make money, they&#39;re taking what talents they might have and putting them on the market as instructional services.&amp;nbsp;
But what should I consider if these are a prospect?&amp;nbsp; The cost of footing the bill for&amp;nbsp;a teen soccer development team can run a family into the thousands of dollars annually and the same can be spent locally at a baseball training facility.&amp;nbsp; Is it worth it?
As a full disclosure, we&#39;ve forked over money&amp;nbsp;for piano and vocal lessons; the former simply because we believe that it&#39;s important for children with any interest in music to learn how to play piano and read music and the latter more recently because Middle has a good voice and a budding interest in the arts as a career.&amp;nbsp; But the sports realm is a different issue for us.&amp;nbsp; Youngest&amp;nbsp;wants to play drums but his talent is physical; as Eldest &#45; his sister &#45; once commented, he&#39;s the family jock.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s played soccer and wants to take up both football and rugby when he&#39;s older, assuming that his mother and I finally agree on whether those are options.&amp;nbsp; But his love is baseball, which he&#39;s played for years now.&amp;nbsp; His fielding is good and he&#39;s proven to be an okay pitcher, but his real talent has been at the plate and that&#39;s where the question now arises.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s continually hit in the upper .300s and he rarely strikes out; he&#39;s got an ability to put the bat to the ball and at least put it into play.&amp;nbsp; In the movie Moneyball, a scout talks to a prospect&#39;s parents and comments that baseball is a game that the true players love but one that tells many at some point that it no longer loves them back and they move on.&amp;nbsp; Youngest is getting to a competitive level where more kids are finding that the sport doesn&#39;t love them as much as they love it and they&#39;re being winnowed away.&amp;nbsp; Apart from a week&#45;long summer baseball clinic run by the local university program,&amp;nbsp;do we cough up some extra money to hire someone to work with him personally?
As I write this, the back of my head is snorting derisively as it states Seriously?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a kid&#39;s game fer chrissake...&amp;nbsp; and I partially agree with that.&amp;nbsp; But it also comes down to three factors &#45; expectations, odds and finances.
What are the expectations from such an act?&amp;nbsp; Am I looking for the next great batting champion or just helping the kid?&amp;nbsp; More importantly, does he want this or this being done for me?
What are the odds on potential outcomes?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s statistically damned near impossible that he, or any other kid, will ever make the big leagues.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s a greater likelihood that with some effort, he can turn this love for the game into assistance with his college education; I know several families who have staked their kids&#39; college on massive investments in sport clinics and special teams, more than I expect to spend.&amp;nbsp;
What are the finances?&amp;nbsp; This won&#39;t be taking the place of the 529 plan, but is there some way that I can funnel some funds off to cover the expense?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s also an additional perspective to finances and that&#39;s in the future.&amp;nbsp; I spoke with the mother of an elementary age softball player who was paying $35/hour to a young woman who played softball seriously through college and her comment was that if her own girl stuck with it, she could also wind up with the skill set that would allow her to make some on&#45;the&#45;side money from coaching future youngsters.&amp;nbsp;
That&#39;s precisely where we need to understand that we are employment&#45;wise.&amp;nbsp; There are no longer going to be any major corporations that will carry you on the books for your lifespan and looming public austerity makes the dole iffy at best.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re going to have to assess your skill&#45;set and creatively figure out what you need to do to cobble together an income&#45;stream to support yourself and your family.
And remember that if you are able to handle such an expense in some form, you&#39;re doing more to put food on another family&#39;s table than purchasing crap from Walmart.

<title>Refining Fatherhood - The Need</title>
<body>Another Father&#39;s Day is upon us and it&#39;s ironic that it was preceded by a controversial Time magazine cover and article&amp;nbsp;asking women if they&#39;re &amp;quot;Mom enough&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s another shot in the on&#45;going, low&#45;intensity war amongst mothers pitting stay&#45;at&#45;home moms and working moms as a significant minority of the stay&#45;at&#45;homes practice attachment parenting; the philosophic premise is that strong bonds and stronger babies are the result of a high&#45;contact environment between mothers and infants.&amp;nbsp; Natually, there are women &#45; such as the young mother on the cover &#45; who tend to take the philosophy to an extreme.&amp;nbsp; It does however, beg the question of what it means to be a father.
If I&#39;m going to be a father, what does that mean?&amp;nbsp; What precisely does a father do and what is my primary role with the kids and family?&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t a theoretical exercise as several decades of social and economic change have whipsawed the American family and American fathers in particular.
Rise of Divorce&amp;nbsp;
While the divorce rate amongst American marriages has leveled off in recent years, it rose significantly from the 1960s in part to the adoption of no&#45;fault policies by many states.&amp;nbsp; With courts siding with the mother for child custody, a significant number of children found themselves in family units in which there was minimal paternal involvement.&amp;nbsp; These kids became adults and the results of the divorce became apparent as co&#45;habitation became acceptable with fewer opting to marry so as to preserve their ability to simply walk away should things not work out.&amp;nbsp; The girls of divorce also saw their mothers struggle as they were forced to both parent the kids and keep a roof over the heads; while difficult, there was a role model for the girls.&amp;nbsp; The boys of divorce weren&#39;t so fortunate as the fathers were largely removed and sidelined, some struggling to stay involved in a meaningful way and others simply giving up.&amp;nbsp; These boys were often left with no meaningful role model for a father who was involved on a regular basis.
Portrayal in the Media&amp;nbsp;
Television has been a central role in American culture since the early 1950s and the portrayal of the American father has changed dramatically in that time.&amp;nbsp; Jim Anderson of Father Knows Best is an early&amp;nbsp;portrayal of the American father, but while unrealistic, Dad was portrayed positively.&amp;nbsp; The paternal roles shifted with society over the decades until the late 1980s with the arrival of Married with Children&#39;s Al Bundy, and the floor completely gave way under television&#39;s view of Dad.&amp;nbsp; While the entire family structure was lampooned, the idea of Dad took a huge hit and the hits kept on coming with Homer Simpson and any number of other television fathers who were portrayed as clueless, well&#45;meaning fools who were kept in line by the watchful eye of Mom and more often than not, the kids.&amp;nbsp; There were isolated instances in which fathers received a friendly portrayal, but it&#39;s only been in the past two or three years that the father has begun to receive realistic portrayals, such as in NBC&#39;s Parenthood.
Feminism/Changing Role of Women in Society&amp;nbsp;
Women have advocated for change in their place in society and that&#39;s a good thing as&amp;nbsp;our resources are wasted when&amp;nbsp;half of our society&#39;s members are relegated to very gender&#45;specific roles.&amp;nbsp; But change isn&#39;t always pretty nor is it easy.&amp;nbsp; Hard&#45;core feminists have advocated for the right of women to fully enter the political and business realm, but while that push talks up the ability of women, it has frequently also entailed denegrating men in different facets.&amp;nbsp; For more than a generation, women entered the workforce with the expectation of having a successful career and a family; the notion was pushed by media and feminism that you really could have it all.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, being successful financially and professionally requires commitment and time &#45;&amp;nbsp; what children require in spades.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s an additional impact upon children as a small but growing number of women opt to finally become single mothers after spending the time and energy to become professionally successful at the expense of their personal lives.&amp;nbsp; While the number is small, the ripple effect is the question what&#39;s the use of a father? to younger women.
Economic Change&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s become apparent in the past decade that the Golden Age of the American economy is coming to a close.&amp;nbsp; Globalization has shifted high&#45;value employment overseas and our own economy has become much more dependent upon the service and public sectors for employment.&amp;nbsp; Family income is now dropping and it&#39;s become apparent that the American standard of living has been maintained by an easy flow of credit; we could afford the niceties because of our ability to borrow to pay for them but the debt has reached strangulation levels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The effect&amp;nbsp;of globalization has also been pernicious upon the family as&amp;nbsp;many of those jobs flowing&amp;nbsp;away were&amp;nbsp;traditionally filled predominantly by men.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the collapse of construction spending meant that&amp;nbsp;predominantly masculine construction jobs also took hits.&amp;nbsp; Women in the workforce is now not only a matter of choice, but of necessity.&amp;nbsp;
All of these factors have come together in a nasty, potent brew greatly affecting the institution of fatherhood in America.&amp;nbsp; Men are working under considerable pressure to create workable models of fatherhood for their children and it would be helpful if there was at least a template of expectations against which they could draw the components.

<title>Doom-prepping:&nbsp; Managing the Pantry</title>
<body>While many are still out of the loop as to global financial developments &#45; Spain has just joined Greece in the bailout line and Italy is looking peaked &#45; enough are starting to become anxious about how they might be prepared in the event that the wheels come off of the economic bus.&amp;nbsp; One of the big things that people tend to do, especially if they listen to Glenn Beck or are into Doomer mode, is assure that their larder is fully stocked.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t as extreme as it appears as the unemployment rate is again rising and folks are wondering if and when they&#39;re liable to be next.&amp;nbsp; But stocking the pantry isn&#39;t a one&#45;off proposition and I&#39;m going to spend the next day or two in reviewing the status of what&#39;s in our own larder.
Most American households didn&#39;t have the stocked pantries prior to the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; With a higher percentage of the family income spent on food and limited storage space in much smaller homes, many housewives did their shopping on an almost daily basis at the neighborhood grocer.&amp;nbsp; The arrival of the supermarkets in the 1920s and improvements meant that food was more readily available and easily stored but that didn&#39;t translate into a societal change until the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; Older Americans, children of the Depression, recalled the memories of bare pantries and no money and made major changes when they established their own households so that their own children wouldn&#39;t undergo their own experiences.&amp;nbsp; I recall, as a child, asking my own mother why we had so much in the pantry and her comments to the effect that she wouldn&#39;t be caught shorthanded again.&amp;nbsp;
Times are tense yet again and the reality is that there&#39;s the prospect of another Lehman&#45;style financial crisis as the Europeans face a continent&#45;wide debacle due to huge debts and a structurally weak currency.&amp;nbsp; How is it structurally weak?&amp;nbsp; Remember that a currency is not only an economic device, but also a political one as it&#39;s heavily dependent upon the policy choices and politics of it&#39;s nation.&amp;nbsp; The European bind is that they&#39;ve got a currency which presupposes a political structure with full integration such as the United States has with it&#39;s Constitution, yet their funding is heavily dependent upon the individual actions of the constituent states such as occurred in the earliest&amp;nbsp; years of the US during the period of the Articles of Confederation.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a round currency in a square political hole.&amp;nbsp; The simple reality is that the global financial system is so interdependent that what happens in Greece will not only affect the French, Spanish and other banks, but have a derivative effect upon the American banks which have all manner of exposure to the European banks.&amp;nbsp;
Which brings us back to the family pantry.&amp;nbsp; One of the key policy responses to these issues has been a repetitive flooding of liquidity into the financial markets from the various Central Banks and when they fill the buckets, the buckets tend to slosh around to other areas; one of the key areas is in the realm of commodities, particularly food.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s become apparent from monitoring prices via a simple grocery basket&amp;nbsp;&#45; the PracticalDad Price Index &#45; over 18 months is that food costs are now accelerating and their effect is being masked by flatter non&#45;food prices within the grocery cart.&amp;nbsp; Food prices are rising but incomes are not, so if you&#39;re going to stock up, you have to assure that the resources that you expend now are as effective as possible.
Effectively preparing means&amp;nbsp;that you are actually going to pay attention and manage&amp;nbsp;the household food supply.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something&amp;nbsp;on which I could personally do better, so time will be spent&amp;nbsp;on the process.

    What do we presently have in the pantry?&amp;nbsp;
    What is the age of the supply, i.e. am I sitting on cans eight years out of date?&amp;nbsp; If you think it odd, understand that the Boy Scouts do an annual food drive for their neighborhood food banks and in sorting the food collected, we&#39;ve come across cans of beans more than a decade past their expiration date.
    What do we actually need and what mismatch exists?&amp;nbsp; Am I sitting on 20 cases of corn while I really need flour?
    What system must I begin to use to assure that this occurs more than once each decade with the loss of hundreds of dollars of food?

While this process happens, there are other and more general questions to answer.&amp;nbsp; What is the time frame for which I need to prepare, end of the world or just a few months of supplemental food to help ease my future cash flow?&amp;nbsp; How much am I willing and able to share with others, and who are those others?
The final upshot of the project is that this is another reminder of how our way of life is resetting to an earlier time, when families had to make much more conscious decisions about how to use their resources.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Withhold the High School Diploma?&nbsp; Yep, You Betcha</title>
<body>Eldest graduated from high school the other evening, ending thirteen years of public education before moving on to the next stage.&amp;nbsp; So there&#39;s a vested interest to read that a high school actually withheld the diplomas of four graduates&amp;nbsp;because of their families excessive celebrating.&amp;nbsp; Were the superintendent and principal correct in their action?
Let&#39;s set the stage for the personal event.&amp;nbsp; Eldest was one of 461 students to graduate in her class and the ceremony was held in the air&#45;conditioned gym of a local university; the district shifted the ceremony there after multiple attendees fainted in the high school facility two years ago due to the heat.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a decent sound system and the event occurred in an orderly process as the graduates received their diplomas in two separate lines entering from opposite sides of the stage.&amp;nbsp; Cameras set up opposite each line allowed a video feed of each graduate to one of two separate large screens so that the thousands of people there were able to see their kid receive their diploma.&amp;nbsp; The ceremony was so smoothly handled that the 461 graduates received their diplomas in the span of approximately fifteen and the entire ceremony was completed in 90 minutes.
At the outset of the ceremony, the principal spoke and as part of his remarks, asked that parents and guests refrain from any applause or cheering until the end so that all of the families there were able to hear the name of their own child being announced.&amp;nbsp; It was only a few minutes into the actual awarding of diplomas that the first family began to cheer and then, multiple other families yelled vociferously and in one instance, the family blew noisemakers.&amp;nbsp; The large majority of the guests followed the request, but a small minority refused.&amp;nbsp; Sure enough, in each instance of celebration, the names of at least one or more subsequent graduates were rendered&amp;nbsp;unintelligible in the din and those families might have seen the child on the screen, but never heard the name being announced.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Despite the noise and intermittent hoopla, the ceremony occurred without interruption and those that couldn&#39;t hear their graduate&#39;s name called were simply out of luck.
Based upon the linked article, the Cincinnati school district is several years ahead of ours in terms of the issue.&amp;nbsp; Eldest&#39;s class was frankly warned by the administration that any misbehavior or excessive display on their part could imperil the receipt of the diploma.&amp;nbsp; I have little doubt that the Cincinnati administration did the same and managed to bring the graduates under control &#45; assuming that they actually followed through on their threat.&amp;nbsp; But it became apparent that the issue wasn&#39;t with the graduates but with the families themselves and after multiple efforts to request mutual respect of one another over the course of several years &#45; and heated complaints from other parents &#45; they settled upon a policy of holding the diploma pending appropriate behavior by all parties.&amp;nbsp; This policy was announced in writing and disseminated with the tickets that were distributed to the families so no one can say that they shouldn&#39;t have known.&amp;nbsp; The only remaining question would be whether the school administration would actually follow through on the new policy.&amp;nbsp;
When the event occurred, multiple families celebrated and according to the article, it wasn&#39;t the noise level so much as the duration.&amp;nbsp; This meant that the families immediately following their own kids weren&#39;t able to hear the names called and the school responded as had been promised.&amp;nbsp; Be clear on something here:&amp;nbsp; the only thing withheld is the actual paper diploma and the four graduates were able to participate with their class in the ceremony.&amp;nbsp; Their names were announced and they walked up and &#45; if there school is like Eldest&#39;s &#45; received the leather folder which was actually empty as the diplomas themselves were disseminated at the end of the ceremony after the class had filed out to whatever tune was played.&amp;nbsp;
Let&#39;s be frank.&amp;nbsp; The public culmination of thirteen years of public education is the graduation ceremony.&amp;nbsp; Critics can say that public education has been dumbed down enough so as to render the achievement meaningless but there are plenty of kids for whom it is an&amp;nbsp;achievement and the same goes for their families.&amp;nbsp; Together, many have weathered whatever challenges might have arisen in that period.&amp;nbsp; Families have been affected by lost jobs and foreclosed houses, the dissolution of families caused by divorce or the difficulties arising from substance abuse.&amp;nbsp; The ceremony is, for many, the public capstone to their thirteen year experience and is as important for them as for others. &amp;nbsp;I understand how important it is to the families to hear their child&#39;s name publicly proclaimed and I suspect that any of these four families would be hurt to find that their graduate&#39;s name was omitted.&amp;nbsp; So here&#39;s the trade&#45;off that the school has put forward:&amp;nbsp; go ahead if you want to cheer so lustily that the following names are unintelligible but expect that the diploma will be withheld as a small token to the graduates who receive their diploma but whose recognition has been virtually erased by your own noise.
My sympathies lie with the graduates, both those with names drowned out and those celebrated.&amp;nbsp; These kids have a common bond not shared by the families and I suspect that there&#39;s some loyalty to one another that the families don&#39;t understand.&amp;nbsp; Many kids tend to be easily embarrassed by their family&#39;s actions and if these four are like mine, the discipline is doubled as the withholding of the diploma is matched by the embarrassment at their parents&#39; behavior.
If my own school district should decide to pursue such a policy, I will support it and I know of about five other families who will as well.

<title>Yard Sales - Surveying the Damage</title>
<body>Our media topics are a reflection of what concerns us at the moment.&amp;nbsp; In the 1950s, fear of nuclear war and radiation was reflected in numerous science&#45;fiction films such as Them; our concerns about succumbing to Communism&#39;s soulless collectivism was played out in the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&amp;nbsp; Our revulsion to&amp;nbsp;militarism and the failed Vietnamese War played out in The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now.&amp;nbsp; As I flip around the television dial, it becomes apparent that there&#39;s another meme afoot and that pertains to our opinions towards wealth and a growing awareness of&amp;nbsp;our economy, how far we&#39;ve fallen and what we face.
It dawned on me the other night as I sat before the television.&amp;nbsp; The History Channel was touting the high cable ratings of such shows as Pawn Stars, American Pickers and Swamp People; it brought to mind the trendsetter for the bunch, Mike Rowe&#39;s Dirty Jobs.&amp;nbsp; To check myself, I flipped on the On Demand menu and noted that the majority of the History offerings were for shows that dealt with cashing in on old items or dangerous occupations.&amp;nbsp; Unlike the network&#39;s early origins, not a single show itself dealt with historical events.&amp;nbsp; As I surveyed the channel offerings, certain other popular cable shows dealing with wealth caught my attention.&amp;nbsp; There are multiple shows about Housewives behaving badly in places like Beverly Hills, New York and Atlanta and my guilty favorite, Dance Moms, which pertains to mothers who spend inordinate amounts of money to have their daughters taught dance.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve turned the page from that &#39;80s fave, Robin Leach&#39;s Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.&amp;nbsp; We admire the concept of wealth and God knows that enough of us play the lottery in the hopes&amp;nbsp;of striking the Big One, but we no longer put the wealthy on a pedestal.&amp;nbsp; As ill&#45;thought economic policies cut a swath through the middle&#45;class and the American concept of succeeding is ground down, we look at the wealthy in a new and more biased light.&amp;nbsp; Each of these shows the shallow and petulant behavior of someone with money behaving badly and our collective response is akin to rubbernecking at a serious accident &#45; we know that it&#39;s bad but we can&#39;t stop looking.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, it provides a salve for our damaged aspirations with the thought being Wow, money can really do terrible things to a person...thank God that&#39;ll never happen to me.
Yesterday&#39;s beautiful June weather also brought out a huge number of yard sales as people took the opportunity to both purge their household of accumulated crap and raise money to pay bills.&amp;nbsp; I was out early as Eldest rented space at a large church&#45;sponsored yard sale &#45; raising money to help offset the cost of a planned beach trip &#45; and my job was to deliver the tables to the site.&amp;nbsp; The number of yard sale signs in the early morning neighborhoods was impressive and there were a significant number of buyers as well with cars parked up and down various streets near each sale.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve become programmed to the decades&#45;long consumerist mentality that equates purchase with pleasure but as our incomes recede, we must find new and cheaper ways to feed our habit and the yard sale is a good alternative.&amp;nbsp; Shows like Pawn Stars and American Pickers foster a more critical eye amongst some shoppers as people realize that amongst all of the crap for sale amongst this great kitschfest, there are really items of some value and the hope of a growing number is that they&#39;ll find that occasional item of worth and value that could truly be a financial windfall.
We are, in a real sense, like the Berliners of 1945 who cull through the rubble in the hopes of finding something worth salvaging in the debris.&amp;nbsp; Except that the bricks and timber are the mounds of cheap clothing and miscellanea on which we&#39;ve willingly spent our money.&amp;nbsp;
The yard sales are a great way of fulfilling needs on a limited budget if you&#39;re willing to take the time to look.&amp;nbsp; But the next time that you&#39;re out, consider what&#39;s being sold by whom and then take a look at whether it would be acceptable to the guys of Pawn Stars and American Pickers.

<title>When Playing to Play Becomes Playing to Win</title>
<body>My father once remarked that watching his two children brought him joy.&amp;nbsp; While I appreciated the sentiment in that moment many years ago, it was only when I became a father with my own three trying out new interests that his comment really took root.&amp;nbsp; Seeing the kids have fun and trying new activities is, on one level, frustrating for the schedule and time; but when&amp;nbsp;I see them find those activities at which they do well, then it truly does become what one person calls a joyful thing.&amp;nbsp; That is until they reach a point at which it begins to shift from simply being a fun activity&amp;nbsp;to an avocation at which they want to excel, and you&#39;re forced to see them begin to suffer the physical and psychic bruising that comes with real competition.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case this weekend with Youngest&#39;s baseball playoff game.
We&#39;ve come to love baseball.&amp;nbsp; Throughout our life together, my wife and I&amp;nbsp;lived in cities with minor league teams and have taken advantage of the opportunity to enjoy decent ball, good seats and cheap beer; Youngest has been bitten by the love for the game and now plays each season and is frankly developing into a good player.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s at the age at which baseball&#45;loving boys begin to consider what position they wish to play and in his case, he sees himself as a catcher.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s realistic enough to understand that he&#39;ll never be a fleet&#45;footed outfielder or pitcher&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;in his&amp;nbsp;mind,&amp;nbsp;he has begun to stake a claim behind the plate.&amp;nbsp; Given his young age, we held off three years of requests before finally caving in and getting him catchers gear of his own.
It&#39;s helpful to understand something about Little League baseball and the catcher&#39;s position.&amp;nbsp; For the first&amp;nbsp;two&amp;nbsp;levels of Little League baseball, no stealing is allowed and it&#39;s at the AA level (8 and 9 year olds) that the kids are allowed to begin to steal second and third base; until this point, the catcher is simply a backstop with arms.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s at the AAA level (9 and 10 year olds) that the catcher becomes important as it&#39;s at this level that the runner is now allowed to steal home and score a run and it&#39;s also here that the talented kids start to understand the strategies and tactics of the game.&amp;nbsp; The catcher&#39;s position has been called the field general since from his&amp;nbsp;spot behind the plate, he can see where his fielders are and actually make adjustments and I&#39;ve witnessed two boys who &#45; at this level &#45; have played as though born to the position.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s a double&#45;edged sword for the catcher since he&#39;s also catching for kids who, even when they&#39;re good, can be wild with a sizable number of passed balls and with the catcher&#39;s cumbersome&amp;nbsp;gear and inexperience, the plate is&amp;nbsp;ripe for&amp;nbsp;the taking by aggressive baserunners from third&amp;nbsp;base.&amp;nbsp; The safeguard for the catcher at AAA is that the batting team can only steal home twice per inning.
While Youngest wishes to be the catcher, this season&#39;s reality was that a recurrent knee injury kept him from playing there due to the stress of constant squatting.&amp;nbsp; He missed the first game and spent the remainder of the season in the infield and the catcher&#39;s mitt was relegated to two younger players who were repeatedly burned at the plate by aggressive baserunning.&amp;nbsp; He was finally cleared for catching and his first appearance as catcher was the first playoff game this weekend and in the final practice two nights before the game, his coach had him don his gear for passed ball drills behind the plate with a cadre of teammates repeatedly trying to steal home &#45; and frequently succeeding.&amp;nbsp;
The game was against a team that runs well and aggressively.&amp;nbsp; While I doubt that they hit as well as Youngest&#39;s team, they&#39;re coached to take advantage of mistakes and in the first two games played against them this season, they beat Youngest&#39;s team by aggressive baserunning, including consistent steals of home plate.&amp;nbsp; It was clear that the strategy would be more of the same and if there was to be a change, it would be up to Youngest to make that change by keeping them from stealing home plate.
We live in a world in which some schools and organizations have dumbed down sports by abolishing the idea&amp;nbsp;of winners and losers.&amp;nbsp; Everybody should get a ribbon for participating and our kids apparently need their self&#45;esteem bolstered more than their skills.&amp;nbsp; But that&#39;s not how life works and in this particular organization, there comes a point at which kids play not only for fun but also to win.&amp;nbsp; There are always far more teams at the youngest levels of a sport as everyone tries it out for size but within a few years, the funsters have departed and the number of teams have decreased to accommodate the kids who truly love the game.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also at this point that the kids realize that if you&#39;re going to play, you should play to win and the coaches are there to&amp;nbsp;develop their skills and teach them to win; sometimes, winning is more than just physical attributes but also thinking about what you need to do to win and the coaches have to model that for the kids.
The upshot was that the opposing coaches did more of the same, sending runners from third on every passed ball opportunity, and Youngest took his lumps behind the plate as he repeatedly tore off his mask and helmet,&amp;nbsp;searching furiously for the ball as it rolled around the backstop area.&amp;nbsp; The pitchers did what they were supposed to do as they advanced to cover home, but while there were some close plays, the runs scored.&amp;nbsp; The boy got banged up in the melees but to his credit, he refused to quit and stuck through the game.&amp;nbsp; My first inclination as I watched the play was anger towards the opposing coaches for taking advantage but there was a begrudging respect for their strategy as they taught their own kids that they could win with more than pure hitting.&amp;nbsp; This was a learning experience on both sides of the ball, joyful on one and painful on the other.&amp;nbsp;
Despite the painful learning experience, Youngest still wants to catch and I admire him for that.&amp;nbsp; There will be other such lessons &#45; both in baseball and life &#45; in his future but learning from them now will help him in such instances in the future.&amp;nbsp; There comes a point with the kids that shielding them from adversity only serves to hinder them in the future as bosses and clients will not be so forgiving of errors.&amp;nbsp; So teach them to play to win now, when their losses won&#39;t have more serious consequences.

<title>Okay, So Green Lantern is Gay&#8230;</title>
<body>...and apart from DC Comics making money from it, how is that any different than what the kids see when they go to the mall?
One of the traits of our society that I do admire &#45; and there are&amp;nbsp;still some&amp;nbsp;&#45; is that over time, Americans have the capacity to accept change as generations come and go.&amp;nbsp; People can argue that racism still exists and to an extent, it still does, but so long as there are people, racism will always exist to one degree or another; the same goes for religious bigotry and sexism.&amp;nbsp; But the prevailing attitudes change and society as a whole becomes more tolerant and what was once harassed is able to come out into the open.&amp;nbsp; So it is with homosexuality.&amp;nbsp; In the relatively short time frame of four decades, homosexuality has shifted out of the closet and into the mainstream consciousness as gay men and women protest and proselytize for their rights.&amp;nbsp; Their road has not been easy and there&#39;s been a tendency to flaunt their beliefs in ways that cut against still&#45;extant Christian values, but there has been demonstrable progress.
Unless parents want to raise their kids in a compound, there&#39;s no way to shield them from societal change.&amp;nbsp; What we can do is pay attention and use the instances to teach the lessons that we want pass along our values to the kids.&amp;nbsp; Our first foray into explaining homosexuality was when Eldest was in elementary school; on a trip to the mall, she saw a lesbian couple walking down the corridor with arms around one another&#39;s waists and as they passed, she turned and watched them from behind as they walked away.&amp;nbsp; The questions soon arose but our first lesson was not to stare at someone as it&#39;s impolite.&amp;nbsp; After that point was made, there was further conversation about the basic difference between homosexuality and heterosexuality.&amp;nbsp; The big difference, Eldest, is that gay people find romantic interest in someone of their own sex...&amp;nbsp; Regardless of whatever you believe about the issue, you have to ready and able to discuss it with them and not just turn away because it isn&#39;t going to go away.
The point is this:&amp;nbsp; DC Comics&#39; action is really in the interest of profit and not in empowering gay role models for impressionable young readers.&amp;nbsp; As social mores shift and change, these events are going to occur and as parents, we have to aware of them and be ready to discuss it with the kids.&amp;nbsp; They do see sexual identity issues amongst their peers as their friends and acquaintances &#45; maybe even they themselves&amp;nbsp;&#45; puzzle it out, even at the&amp;nbsp;elementary school level.&amp;nbsp; Use the opportunity to make whatever point you want, but don&#39;t think that you can just ban it because these developments are everywhere.
Middle and Youngest are both comic book fans and when I shared the story with them at Saturday&#39;s dinner, their response was surprise.&amp;nbsp; It didn&#39;t make them want to avoid the character and the conversation shifted to the plot details including how there could be two Green Lanterns in alternate universes.&amp;nbsp; But I thought that Hal Jordan was into women, at least he was in the movie...Where the conversation broke down was in the actual dialogue between Green Lantern and his boyfriend as the superhero described a&amp;nbsp;planned date as magical; even the 10 year&#45;old noted the incongruity between a powerful superhero and stereotypical language.&amp;nbsp; Dad, why couldn&#39;t he have just said &amp;quot;fabulous&amp;quot;?&amp;nbsp;
So just a quick note to the writers at DC &#45; if you want to shatter stereotypes and empower gay youngsters, avoid the trite terminology.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re killing yourselves.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; The Grocery Market Basket is Splitting as Food Prices Rise</title>
<body>The results of the June 2012 PracticalDad Price Index show that while the total market basket index declined slightly from May&#39;s 106.49 to June&#39;s 105.91 (November 2010 = 100), the food items portion actually rose significantly from May&#39;s 109.65 to June&#39;s 110.85.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that the cost of the total market basket rose by only 5.9% from November 2010 to June 2012, the actual food items themselves rose by 10.85%, a full 5% more.&amp;nbsp;
In May, 2012, the&amp;nbsp;reporting&amp;nbsp;format of the PracticalDad Price Index changed as I began to calculate the index on both a full market&#45;basket basis and a food&#45;only market basket basis.&amp;nbsp; There are 47 total items in the PracticalDad market basket and of these, 37 are actual foodstuffs with the remaining 10 being household, over&#45;the&#45;counter medication and personal hygiene products commonly purchased at grocery stores.&amp;nbsp; All 47 items together comprise the total market basket index while the food&#45;only index is based solely upon the 37 items.
When you sense that food costs are rising more rapidly than other costs, this is a datapoint which supports that notion.&amp;nbsp; While the two indices moved in tandem from November 2010 to August 2011, it was in November 2011 that the prices for food themselves began to separate from the remainder; the activity amongst the non&#45;food items masked the cost activity.&amp;nbsp; From November 2011 to June 2012, the total index wandered in a narrow range from 105.56 to 105.91; during that same period, the food&#45;only index rose consistently from November 2011&#39;s 106.38 to June&#39;s 110.85.&amp;nbsp; In the three month period of February &#45; May 2012, the food&#45;only index increased by almost two full percentage points.
While there have been instances which supported the existence of stealth inflation, where prices are constant or drop slightly but package sizes decrease, June&#39;s pricing at three separate grocery stores found three instances of package changes:

    one grocery store continues to sell hot dog rolls in 8 count packages, but the weight of the package decreased from 12 to 11 ounces;
    another grocery chain joined its brand competitors by decreasing the Orange Juice packaging from 64 ounce cartons to 59 ounce cartons;
    the feminine pads are in the process of changing package sizing from 42 to 39 count cartons and this is in process as the local grocer still carries the old size package while the separate chains now carry the newer, smaller packages.

As before,the prices are adjusted to account for the stealth inflation.
So the next time you bite into that grilled hot dog and marvel at how it plump it is, there&#39;s a good chance that it actually isn&#39;t.

<title>PracticalDad and School:&nbsp; Austerity Comes Home, Part Two</title>
<body>Despite all of the talk of recovery and normalization, the new normal &#45; austerity&amp;nbsp;&#45; ripples&amp;nbsp;through the real economy.&amp;nbsp; As the public sector sheds jobs, this includes the educational system across the country.&amp;nbsp; While everybody can claim a share of the pie, the reality in Pennsylvania is particularly acute since state law requires that school districts fully fund their teacher pension plans and in the next several years, this contribution will rise from approximately 7% of school district budget to about 18% and if taxes aren&#39;t going to rise proportionately, the money has to come from somewhere.&amp;nbsp; But where?&amp;nbsp; And just how good is the information that you&#39;re hearing?
What I&#39;ve concluded is that the kids are paying attention &#45; at some level &#45; but that information is either third hand or badly misconstrued.&amp;nbsp; Eldest came home several months ago with the observation that the district&#39;s music program was on the chopping block as the school administrators were suddenly hanging around and talking to the kids and &amp;quot;asking questions.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; She followed this up with the synopsis of another conversation that she had with a teacher, in which it was said that the wave of the future was to cross&#45;teach so that music would be rolled into the physical education program.&amp;nbsp; I politely listened and then promptly filed it in my mental uh&#45;huh drawer.&amp;nbsp; But the other day, I came across an article that discusses another school district discussing cuts in the music and arts in order to strengthen the core academic programs.
My home state, Pennsylvania, instituted the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment &#45; PSSA &#45;&amp;nbsp;tests in response to Bush&#39;s No Child Left Behind legislation; the intent is to monitor how kids are performing and rating the schools accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Schools with poor performance are forced to institute remedial action plans and if they don&#39;t work, I assume that they wind up in administrative detention.&amp;nbsp; The reality of the PSSA is that the schools have universally found themselves teaching to a test and it&#39;s grating to a parent&#39;s nerves to only hear from little Johnny that they spent half the day doing review work for topics that about two&#45;thirds of the students already know and a small fraction will never know because they were whacked in the head with the stupid stick.&amp;nbsp; Like the comedian Ron White once said, you can&#39;t fix stupid.&amp;nbsp;
The state however, is moving beyond the PSSA tests and is in the process of implementing the Keystone Tests, which commence for students in the class of 2015.&amp;nbsp; These exams will cover a variety of topic areas &#45; Algebra 1 &amp;amp; 2, Geometry, Civics, Science, US and World History amongst others &#45; and seniors will have to pass a certain number of them in order to graduate.&amp;nbsp; Those who don&#39;t pass the requisite amounts will not graduate.&amp;nbsp; The difficulty for the districts however is that the state continues to alter the requirements and thus presents the local educators a moving target that must be hit starting in 2015;&amp;nbsp;the districts are left trying to plan to meet a goal that might yet change again.&amp;nbsp; A local school district, considered to be one of the wealthier ones, is now actively considering how to cut the arts programs in order to put the money into the core academic courses mandated under the Keystone Test Program.
Our educational system&#39;s priorities are reverting to a period predating America&#39;s economic golden&#45;age, which began after the end of the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; These priorities are assuring that the mass of youth are able to handle the most important aspects while leaving the non&#45;essentials &#45; and that&#39;s what the coming debate is going to cover &#45; to those who find them interesting.
What else are the local districts doing to handle the austerity crunch?

    Three local districts, each with strong academic programs, are pooling resources to offer combined higher&#45;level courses to their students.&amp;nbsp; The classes, such as Advanced Placement Physics, would be held at one central campus location and the students from the three districts would travel to that site for the course.&amp;nbsp;
    One rural district is actively cutting back the athletic program and is shifting to a pay&#45;to&#45;play model, in which the students must pay a fee to play a particular sport.&amp;nbsp; The Athletic Director&#39;s position has been eliminated and that work is now handled by a vice&#45;principal and the district is trying to herd cats by getting the various sport booster clubs to merge into&amp;nbsp;one sports booster club to fundraise for all sports.
    Report cards are no longer mailed to the home, but are given to the students to give to the parents.&amp;nbsp; The reality however, is that any parent with a computer is now able to access their child&#39;s grades via the school district website.

<title>When to Start Mowing the Yard?</title>
<body>My wife and I were discussing the ongoing yardwork issue last week when the topic turned to whether Youngest is now old enough to pitch in on mowing the grass.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s huge for his age &#45; he was born in the midst of a growth spurt that hasn&#39;t quit &#45; and he has uncommonly common sense for a kid of his age.&amp;nbsp; The problem however, is that he&#39;s still in elementary school and there&#39;s another two years before he&#39;s into middle school, so the question was whether he was ready to handle a power mower.
No two kids are the same and while one might be ready for a certain responsibility, it&#39;s not a given that the sibling will be ready at the same age.&amp;nbsp; It might be a function of physical capability but more often than not, it&#39;s an issue of judgment and sense of responsibility.
When we talked about the matter, we had to think about when our older kids actually began to cut the grass.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve come to realize is that if you don&#39;t keep explicit notes, kids are akin to old appliances in that you lose track of time.&amp;nbsp; Lessee here...we bought that refrigerator about five years ago, no?&amp;nbsp; Wait, we got it right after Grandma moved in with us and she actually died about 15 years ago.&amp;nbsp; Yep, it might be time to replace it instead of repairing it again. &amp;nbsp;Eldest actually was older when she began to mow the yard but that was a function of having a riding mower with a larger yard.&amp;nbsp; She began to use the riding mower the summer before Middle School and then, she only did the yard when I was actually doing other outside chores and able to keep an eye on her handling of the machine.&amp;nbsp; We subsequently moved to a house with a much smaller yard &#45; but God, the landscaping makes this one far more difficult &#45; and I replaced the riding mower with a simple self&#45;propelled lawnmower.&amp;nbsp; Middle was by now in late elementary school when I broke him into the process and like with his older sister, I spent time outside watching until I was comfortable that he could handle the mower, especially on slopes.&amp;nbsp;
My own professional background is in claims adjusting and risk management and I thought that I&#39;d seen enough to assess risk better than most.&amp;nbsp; But it was still Middle&#39;s experience that taught me that there&#39;s more than just a moving blade on a mower to injure someone.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d been through the discussions and oversight and Middle had learned about the dead man&#39;s handle, removing the spark plug cap and how to mow on slopes; I&#39;d cleared him and he was happily mowing the yard on his own recognizance.&amp;nbsp; By the way, happiness is a short&#45;term phenomenon and wears off with repeated exposure.&amp;nbsp; While I was in the garage one afternoon, I heard a scream and seconds later, Middle ran into grasping his wrist; he&#39;d turned off the mower and to check something, grabbed hold of the hot engine block.&amp;nbsp; There was a significant second degree burn on the palm and it reminded me of the Gestapo agent in Raiders of the Lost Ark because the grille of the engine block was imprinted on his skin like the hot amulet had been imprinted on the Gestapo agent&#39;s hand.&amp;nbsp; The point is that even if you think that you&#39;ve covered all of the bases, there&#39;s probably something that&#39;s going to bite because you simply assume that the kid knows what you know after years of experience, and they simply don&#39;t.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;re still undecided on whether Youngest is ready and have agreed to disagree on the use of the power mower.&amp;nbsp; From a practical standpoint, this means that Youngest won&#39;t be cutting the grass yet since the repercussions to our own relationship would be dire if I permitted it and he suffered a serious injury.&amp;nbsp; Parents can differ and one can acquiesce to another&#39;s judgment on small things, but the prospect of losing a hand or foot moves the situation to a different level and it&#39;s simply worth it to wait for the day that we both agree on the readiness.
Middle&#39;s painful experience has managed to work out in a weird way for him.&amp;nbsp; The scar to the palm is minimal but a sufficient number of nerve endings were damaged that he&#39;s turned it into a talking point amongst his buddies as he&#39;ll occasionally put the hand over a lit candle or lighter to prove his toughness to the guys; and no, I don&#39;t approve and have warned him against it repeatedly.&amp;nbsp;
Like I said, it&#39;s not the physical capability but rather the judgment.&amp;nbsp; Teenagers, oy.

<title>A Note on the Website</title>
<body>The common question is, do you write the site or does the site write you?&amp;nbsp;
In other words, how much pressure is there to constantly put out material?
My writing has slowed a bit in the past two months and this diminished output will continue for a short while longer as we grapple with the changes that come with multiple children and new phases of life.&amp;nbsp; Please bear with me for a bit longer and while the articles continue, the pace will pick up in a bit.
Thank you reading PracticalDad and putting me on your RSS feed... It&#39;s greatly appreciated.</body>

<title>Kids and Public Controversy</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s a story out of&amp;nbsp;Colorado Springs&amp;nbsp;regarding a white second grader who&amp;nbsp;appeared at his school history day&amp;nbsp;as Martin Luther King, Jr while wearing black face paint to appear as an African&#45;American.&amp;nbsp; The child was participating in a history presentation in which students dressed up as various historical figures for a &amp;quot;wax museum&amp;quot; display and when he came to school, the teacher and administrator were surprised to discover that he was wearing black make&#45;up to cover his face; they asked his parents to remove it and when they refused to do so, they took him home.&amp;nbsp; It is unclear who contacted the media and the slant of the story appears to be that this is once again political correctness run amok as a poor second grader is punished for attempting to do a realistic display on an individual.
Let&#39;s start with the premise of the history project, since Youngest&#39;s entire grade was involved in a similar extravaganza this past week.&amp;nbsp; The premise is that each student chooses an historic figure to study and in Youngest&#39;s grade, make a short presentation about that individual in the first person.&amp;nbsp; Each student must research the life of that figure, write a three paragraph report in the first person &#45; I was the indian maiden who led Lewis and Clark... &#45; and then pull together a costume for the presentation.&amp;nbsp; Each student has two minutes to present themselves to the listener, and the wax museum approach means that the student adopts a frozen stance that&#39;s meaningful to that personage.&amp;nbsp; Starting from the pose, the student then presents the report to the various listeners, who then move on to the next student at the end of the two minutes.&amp;nbsp; In Youngest&#39;s history session, entitled Blast From the Past, each student is at a station in the school&#39;s multipurpose room and at the end of the two minutes, a bell rings and the listener moves on to the next student; the idea is to mimic what you&#39;d find in Madame Tussaud&#39;s Wax Museum.&amp;nbsp;
I can appreciate what the child was attempting to do since baseball&#45;loving Youngest opted to report on Jackie Robinson, the first African&#45;American to break into the major league after the end of the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; His research was decent and he asked if we could somehow get a retro Brooklyn Dodgers uniform and we sprang for a jersey with Robinson&#39;s number and name on the back.&amp;nbsp; About three weeks prior to the event, Youngest also asked if I would help him put black shoe polish on his face so that he could truly get into character.&amp;nbsp; I asked him if his teacher approved of this and he assured me that she would be and when I subsequently saw her, she agreed that the presentation would be better with just the uniform and report and the makeup plan was consigned to the trash.&amp;nbsp; We talked about the rationale for not using the makeup and it was here that he learned of stereotypes and old&#45;time minstrel shows.&amp;nbsp; Curiously, the three African&#45;American boys in his class all opted for non&#45;black figures such as Davy Crockett, Abraham Lincoln and Wayne Gretzky.&amp;nbsp; For this presentation, Jackie Robinson was white and Wayne Gretzky was black.
What I find curious and irritating about the story is the question of who sent the story to the media.&amp;nbsp; According to another AP article, the school wasn&#39;t aware before the child showed up that he&#39;d be in the makeup and they asked the child and parents to remove the makeup before the event started.&amp;nbsp; When the family refused, they &#45; the parents &#45; subsequently removed their son from the event; this action was a parental action, not a school action.&amp;nbsp; Had I been the teacher&amp;nbsp;or principal, I would have also asked the parents to remove&amp;nbsp;the face paint.&amp;nbsp; The schools are public institutions charged with serving&amp;nbsp;all members of an increasingly diverse society and there has to be&amp;nbsp;some sensitivity to their heritage; permitting black face makeup would be akin to serving&amp;nbsp;pork&amp;nbsp;at a school function celebrating children with Muslim&amp;nbsp;or Hebrew heritage.&amp;nbsp; While Political Correctness has been carried to unacceptable extremes, the school officials do have to exercise common sense and this situation is one of simple common sense and not political correctness.&amp;nbsp;
A reporter also contacted Steve Klein of the King Center in Atlanta for his comments and Mr. Klein was frankly correct in his assessment that there was no intent on the boy&#39;s part.&amp;nbsp; The child was asked to portray a person of historic significance and Dr. King&#39;s race was central to his significance, as was Jackie Robinson&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, the kid wanted to do the best job possible and if Dr. King was black, then he thought that he should be as well.
Ultimately, my criticism unfortunately lies with the parents here.&amp;nbsp; They probably didn&#39;t consider the minstrel show stereotype given our sorry understanding of our own history and to bring the kid to school in that makeup can be chalked up as oops, I didn&#39;t know that...&amp;nbsp; But with current controversies about the shooting of Trayvon Martin or whether some local police departments are understating the issue of black youth gangs, to allow your child to appear on television in black&#45;face makeup is placing him in a charged and critical limelight.&amp;nbsp; Our job as parents is to raise the kids and if there&#39;s going to be media coverage about them, it should be in a positive light; allowing them to become poster children in an ongoing controversy about political correctness &#45; or any other divisive issue &#45; is akin to putting a figurative target on their back.&amp;nbsp; Several years ago, the comic&#45;actor John C. McGinley appeared on Glenn Beck&#39;s radio program and politely called Beck on the carpet for using the term retard on his show.&amp;nbsp; McGinley apparently has a child with Down&#39;s Syndrome and simply, and eloquently, stated that using the terminology was piling on, picking a fight with someone who was incapable of fighting back.&amp;nbsp; This boy&#39;s parents have unfortunately allowed him to be placed in a situation in which he&#39;s liable to be forced to contend with a situation for which he&#39;s unprepared.&amp;nbsp; There are true believers with agendas for whom their agenda is all that matters and the person in the way of that agenda is simply fodder for the media cannon.

<title>Dad, Why Are You So Cranky Tonight?</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
My better half is out of town for several days and I&#39;m keeping things together as usual.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s infinitely easier now than when the kids were little, but the question from the two older kids tonight was the same:&amp;nbsp; why are you so cranky tonight?
A friend with older kids once commented that the pressure of raising kids is still there as they age, but it&#39;s different and she was correct.&amp;nbsp; Young children will wear you out with the constant physical demands of feeding, changing, washing and everything else that goes with small ones; even when there might be no physical demands, they want something akin to the fictitious mouse&amp;nbsp;of Laura Numeroff&#39;s excellent children&#39;s story, If You Give a Mouse a Cookie.&amp;nbsp; I should be grateful now because we had an operative curse in the household for years as anytime that my wife departed on a business trip, one or more of the kids fell ill.&amp;nbsp; After it happened twice, I palpably dreaded these trips because they could be &#45; and were &#45; met by episodes of pneumonia, bilateral ear infections and intestinal viruses.&amp;nbsp; Some people have animals that can portend a departure by seeing an open suitcase on a bed, but we had latent viruses that perked up when the luggage came up from the basement.
I&#39;m now past the point of changing blown out diapers and having to spoon&#45;feed the kids but in a sense, they&#39;re still intensely demanding with their short attention spans and raging egocentrism.&amp;nbsp; If they want something to drink, they can get it but there&#39;s no guarantee that the glassware will make it back to the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; Towels will be used and dropped where they are and if a teen doesn&#39;t like the answer to his question, the ensuing conversation can become rancorous and potentially end in a raging indictment of my personal sense of honor, fairness and a general&amp;nbsp;condemnation of the useless values engendered by western civilization.&amp;nbsp; Where one indicts openly, another can respond with sullen silence and pointed use of the dreaded death glare, hoping, like Big Bang Theory&#39;s Sheldon Cooper, to telepathically instigate a minor stroke for nixing plans with the peers.&amp;nbsp; When there are children of different genders, school levels and personalities, the increased stress is more exponential than arithmetic as you bounce along from one pin to another.
Despite it all, I should be grateful because the Eldest leaves in the Fall for college and when she&#39;s out, her presence &#45; and death glare &#45; will be sorely missed.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it will be hardest on my wife however, as she&#39;ll be left to swim in a pool of &#39;tween&#45;age and teen&#45;age testosterone.&amp;nbsp; In the moment however, the gratitude will have to wait until each is abed and quiet, adult rationality returns to the household.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Food Prices Accelerating in May</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
One of the infuriating aspects of the US Government&#39;s CPI is that they use it for the basis for determining other things, such as benefit levels, while maintaining that food really isn&#39;t a core component.&amp;nbsp; While this price index began in November 2010, I began in March 2012 to also calculate the index to show the activity of food prices within the marketbasket exclusive of non&#45;food items (aluminum foil and Dial soap, for instance).
The additional calculation revealed that when non&#45;food items are stripped away, food prices are accelerating at a greater pace; their activity is masked by the generally flat price activity of the non&#45;food components.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, the February 2012 results showed that the cost of the original marketbasket had increased 4.9% (from 11/10&#39;s 100 to 2/12&#39;s 104.90) but the pricing of the food items alone had actually increased by 7.67% (from a food&#45;only basis of 100 in 11/10 to a like basis of 107.67 in 2/12).&amp;nbsp;
The results of the May 2012 pricing to three unrelated grocery stores shows that the overall index again increased to 106.49, which matches the previous high of 106.49 in December 2011; this indicates that the actual cost of the 47 item marketbasket rose 6.49% in that 18 month period.&amp;nbsp; When food items alone are considered and evaluated on that basis, the food&#45;only index comes in at 109.65 so that the prices of the food items alone have risen by 9.65% in that 18 month period.&amp;nbsp;
Notable points:

    Stealth inflation struck again with a grocery chain now selling sugar in 4 pound bags instead of 5 pound bags.&amp;nbsp; As per procedure, I am recalculating the product to the original size to maintain consistency.&amp;nbsp; At some point, expect one or more of the other chains to do the same and the price of sugar to rise accordingly.
    Of the 47 items in the marketbasket, 13 had price increases while 7 declined in price.&amp;nbsp; The largest increase was the price of a pound of roaster chicken, which rose 13.4% from April.

Comparison of Regular and Food&#45;only Indices at three month intervals

<title>(S)Crapbooking</title>
<body>In the past, the mother has historically been the parent who looks inward to the family while the father has looked outwards.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been Mom who&#39;s taken the lead in taking the household and turning it into what the family comes to call home, but that&#39;s changing as more fathers return home.&amp;nbsp; I frankly thought that I&#39;d taken on pretty much everything that mothers have until several weeks ago when a project that required a number of family photos through the years raised it&#39;s head, and my only thought was oh crap.&amp;nbsp;
Multiple projects through the years &#45; science fairs and scouts for example &#45; have led me to craft stores and I&#39;ve always walked past the scrapbooking section with a cursory glance.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, my thinking went, that&#39;s just lovely but it&#39;s something that mebbe I&#39;ll worry about later.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, there was a parental project for graduating high school seniors and the need for the photos made me realize that later is now.&amp;nbsp; The result was a scramble through boxes of old photos and the wholesale reloading of camera cards onto my laptop in a search for meaningful and good photos of Eldest through the years.&amp;nbsp; As the project continued, it became apparent that we also had rolls of old 35 mm film in multiple drawers and while it was too late to use them &#45; meaning that Eldest&#39;s &#39;tween years are missing from the project &#45; the first of them were dispatched to a local camera store for developing.
My wife originally had a plan for all of these photos and started more than 15 years ago to try to create a photographic history of the kids&#39; lives with the intent of giving each a significant album when they reached adulthood.&amp;nbsp; It was a wonderful thought and she kept at it for the first three years of Eldest&#39;s life but the arrival of Middle &#45; let alone Youngest &#45; to the family meant that the project was relegated to the various drawers throughout the basement.&amp;nbsp; To be honest, it was something that I found cute but not terribly important as the kids grew and activities took over but now I&#39;ve come to realize that the albums truly do have significance for them.&amp;nbsp; Eldest knows about the project and was annoyed to find that I refused to show her; other parents have commented that the projects that are being done for their own kids are among the highlights of that particular evening for them.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s now apparent that I badly underestimated the value of the albums and memorykeepers.&amp;nbsp; The kids want, especially as they move into the world, to have a sense of who they are and where they&#39;re from and making the effort to provide something can only be of benefit to them.&amp;nbsp; While I believe that men can do most of what women can in the home, I doubt that most of us have the female sense of taste and that&#39;s certainly true in my own situation.&amp;nbsp; However, I&#39;ll make what was once referred to as a rum go of it in the attempt to provide a scrapbook that isn&#39;t a (s)crapbook.

<title>Rock, Paper, Scissors</title>
<body>It&#39;s been joked about on Big Bang Theory and parodied with ESPN style &amp;quot;World Championships&amp;quot;, but there&#39;s something still very cool about the classic kid&#39;s game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.&amp;nbsp; In an often messy adult world where people can&#39;t settle their differences, it&#39;s a refreshing reminder that disputes can be resolved in a painless fashion.&amp;nbsp; Such was the lesson taught by Youngest&#39;s recent Science Fair project.
Last week was Youngest&#39;s Science elementary school Science Fair and he and one of his buddies opted to do a project together, with the initial concept involving &amp;quot;something about momentum&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Knowing Youngest&#39;s proclivities, I suspected that it didn&#39;t involve toy cars or tennis balls and after the two of them spoke with my wife &#45; the Science Fair Queen &#45; it narrowed down to examining the effect of drag upon a moving object.&amp;nbsp; The final project entailed a comparison of the average running time of a Razor scooter compared with the same scooter bearing a 2&#39; x 4&#39; plywood board tied to the front run on the same downhill course.&amp;nbsp; Since the experiment required that the rider be the same for all of the trials &#45; and it involved wearing a motorcycle helmet &#45; the final question came down to who would ride the scooter down the course.&amp;nbsp; As I sat at my desk eavesdropping on the conversation, an acceptable and useful habit, the boys decided to resolve the dispute with Rock, Paper, Scissors and when I simultaneously heard Youngest call out Crap! while his buddy cheered, I knew the question had been decided.&amp;nbsp; The project came off well but what was refreshing was the willingness of the boys to abide by the game&#39;s outcome; there was no rancor and no pissiness about unfairness and I can only wish that most of the adults in this world had the same attitude.
The game has a place in our relationship, a practice that occurs while waiting for shopping females, a bus or simply killing time.&amp;nbsp; I can still take the boy in most physical activities, but he&#39;s been consistently able through the years to beat me in prolonged game sessions and it was only this weekend, after a sixty round session that he explained his strategy for beating me and most others that he plays.&amp;nbsp; The key is that he&#39;s got a strategy while the rest of us &#45; kids and adults alike &#45; are simply throwing out hand gestures in the hope of winning a particular round.&amp;nbsp; His practice occurs when he loses a round and the opponent throws out the next gesture; he expects that the person will throw the same gesture with the thought that if a gesture won before, it should hopefully win again.&amp;nbsp; He responds with the gesture that can best it and more often than not, he wins that round.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, the person even tries that gesture again and he&#39;ll make a call on whether he thinks that his opponent would be the type to try that.&amp;nbsp; Over a game with multiple rounds, he&#39;ll statistically take the majority from the opponent.&amp;nbsp; After he explained himself, I simply sat and stared at this ten year&#45;old and wondered at how his mind works.
There&#39;s another point to be made however, and it goes beyond a seemingly mindless, pointless game.&amp;nbsp; Take the time to engage the kids in these activities, while waiting at the mall or under a basketball hoop and you&#39;ll be surprised at what you might learn.&amp;nbsp; It might simply pertain to a new favorite flavor of ice cream but again, it might offer a potent insight into the child&#39;s life.&amp;nbsp; When I find that Youngest is starting to play the teen version &#45; Rock, Paper, Scissors, Balls &#45; then I&#39;ll know that he&#39;s arrived at the onset of male puberty.

<title>A Father&#8217;s Wonder</title>
<body>Childhood is a time of wonder, but that childhood doesn&#39;t have to be your own.&amp;nbsp; Fathers also have a sense of wonderment as they look at their children.
We wonder how many diapers we&#39;ll have to change before our precious is finally potty&#45;trained (for the record, I&#39;ve done&amp;nbsp;rough calculations and I&#39;ve legitimately changed more than 10000 of &#39;em).
We wonder how our mates can be so involved in pre&#45;baby planning items that leave us slackjawed and glassy&#45;eyed.
We wonder how much stuff can fit in one small diaper.
We wonder how many times Junior can watch the same episode of Spongebob and still laugh.
We wonder how often we can seek out the source of a noise without having a minor stroke.
We wonder if there&#39;s truth to the old saying that God protects small children, drunks and the United States.
We wonder if we can again figure out, let alone explain, the math that&#39;s being presented to us for help by our children (I signed off on Eldest&#39;s homework when she hit 10th grade).
We wonder how much food one boy can possibly eat in the course of a day, and we marvel at how sparse is the refrigerator at our own elderly parents house (assuming that income isn&#39;t forcing them to choose between food and medicine).
We wonder about the source of these gifts that each child has (I was a lousy athlete and musician, unlike my own three).
We wonder, as we look at our babies, what they&#39;ll look like at different ages and as adults (if you have an infant, make yourself a promise to purposefully look again at their sixteenth and eighteenth birthdays).
We wonder, as we look at our children, on their sixteenth and eighteenth birthdays, where the time went.
We wonder...

<title>A Pox on the College Graduates</title>
<body>I wish somebody had told me I couldn&#39;t get a job with a degree in Western Civ.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Travis, American expatriate tour guide in Rome, 2011
A recent article on poor employment prospects of young college graduates&amp;nbsp;in USA Today demonstrates the miserable situation in which the kids are finding themselves.&amp;nbsp; Fully 53% of the college graduates under 25 are either unemployed or underemployed and there are now more job prospects for retail than engineering and with the majority of graduates laboring under some degree of student debt, people are finally realizing the systemic pox that has been placed upon their house.
This isn&#39;t the first time that the prospects have been dim for college graduates.&amp;nbsp; I graduated college in the early &#39;80s and had a drawer full of rejection letters in a fruitless quest for employment; my first real job &#45; which permitted me the financial independence to set up my own household &#45; didn&#39;t come along for more than another year.&amp;nbsp; But, apart from a starry dream to begin mining asteroids, does our economy have the potential to create sustainable job prospects for all of these youngsters?&amp;nbsp; With children growing and already aware that some form of higher education is important for their long&#45;term prospects, what should I keep in mind?

    First, that kids will receive all manner of commentary and advice from the surrounding media &#45; usually with a pricetag attached &#45; so it&#39;s important for me to keep talking.&amp;nbsp; The italicized comment was made to us by a young American expatriate working in Rome as a tour guide; he&#39;d graduated from a California university about four years ago with a BA degree in Western Civilization and was unemployed here in the states.&amp;nbsp; He showed considerable courage and creativity by taking his show on the road to what he termed the cradle of western civilization and was building a life for himself.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s possible that his parents did tell him about the immediate employability of a Western Civ degree and he was too stubborn or zoned out to pay attention to it but I&#39;ve seen multiple cases first hand in which the parents are saying nothing on the premise that the kid has reached adulthood and has to make his own decisions now.&amp;nbsp; The kid might now be an adult and responsible for her own decisions, but it&#39;s still imperative that I at least provide some commentary so that it&#39;s an informed decision and fully in her best interest.
    Second, understand that what works for one child might not work for another.&amp;nbsp; Eldest&#39;s strengths lend themselves to the academic route and there&#39;s enough scholarship &#45; with savings &#45; to get her through without debt.&amp;nbsp; Middle has a radically different toolbox and isn&#39;t equipped for that route, so perhaps the advice&amp;nbsp;offered by&amp;nbsp;economist Richard Freeman, If you&#39;re not sure what you&#39;re going to be doing, it probably bodes well to take some job, if you can get one, and get a sense first of what you want from college.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s several more years until he&#39;s faced with the decision, but the route that he takes might not be the one taken by his sister.
    Third,&amp;nbsp;if there is&amp;nbsp;a need to&amp;nbsp;use&amp;nbsp;debt to&amp;nbsp;finance college, be sure that you&#39;re part of the process and walk through the payment obligations with&amp;nbsp;your kid.&amp;nbsp; As mindful of the&amp;nbsp;college debt as I am,&amp;nbsp;I try&amp;nbsp;to remember that debt is as much of a tool as a hammer or a screwdriver.&amp;nbsp; One of the non&#45;systemic issues is that with many people, they treat it as the only tool in the box so that they&#39;re hammering when they should be trying a screwdriver instead.&amp;nbsp; If it truly takes some debt, then at least walk through the repayment obligations so that there&#39;s an understanding of what the future bill is going to be.
    Fourth, reinforce&amp;nbsp;the lesson that the&amp;nbsp;present system isn&#39;t&amp;nbsp;truly built to service humanity but the other way around.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You&amp;nbsp;truly need an education and we&#39;ll help you get it!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Don&#39;t worry, your job prospects will increase and it won&#39;t be a problem&amp;nbsp;to repay it...&amp;nbsp;The old axiom applies:&amp;nbsp; if you&#39;re sitting at the table and don&#39;t know who the sucker is, it&#39;s you.

&amp;nbsp;If this were a truly cyclical situation, then my response to Eldest would be to hunker down and it will work out in the end.&amp;nbsp; But I believe, as do many others, that this isn&#39;t the typical job cycle and it&#39;s incumbent upon my wife and I to pay close attention to her college choices so that she doesn&#39;t wind up an expatriate in Rome or drilling for ores on some asteroid.&amp;nbsp;

<title>The Band, Elwood, The Band</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;
The band, Elwood, the band!
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Jake Blues, the Blues Brothers
Children are not little adults, but as&amp;nbsp;they&amp;nbsp;become adults, they&#39;ll&amp;nbsp;find their own interests and tastes.&amp;nbsp; If my job is to support them &#45; whether financially, logistically, emotionally and morally&amp;nbsp;&#45; then that means that I&#39;m going to become familiar with topics and activities with which I&#39;m familiar.&amp;nbsp; We fathers will be forced outside of our comfort zones as fathers&amp;nbsp;who played baseball purchase The Idiot&#39;s Guide to Soccer and hunters become conversant with music and theatre.&amp;nbsp; In my own case, Middle&#39;s sudden entry into the world of garage bands means that I&#39;m so far out of my own zone that I need a compass and Sherpa guide to find my way back.&amp;nbsp; What are some things that I&#39;ve had to learn in this situation?
The first thing that I&#39;ve had to realize is that a garage band involves not only the household, it involves the entire neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; Even with the garage door down, amps and speakers are loud enough that the sound is only muted as it rolls down the street.&amp;nbsp; Even at the outset, when we imposed curfews on practice times to spare neighbors with small children, the comments were such that we moved the band into the basement.&amp;nbsp; I was surprised that the boys actually listened as the situation developed and while the location is less than perfect for them, they&#39;re just happy to have a regular place to practice.
What can be done to minimize the damage to the ears of practicing in an enclosed area?&amp;nbsp; Early rock&#45;and&#45;rollers are notoriously deaf and it&#39;s our desire to see that this doesn&#39;t happen here, so finding earplugs are a necessity; stressing that they be worn&amp;nbsp;&#45; which Middle hasn&#39;t opposed thankfully &#45; is also incumbent.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, I haven&#39;t had to threaten to interrupt practice to perform ear inspections to assure that they&#39;re being worn.
What is the language being used?&amp;nbsp; Lyrics can be famously profane and it&#39;s been made clear from one infraction that cursing won&#39;t be allowed.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fortunate in that their preference is punk and not &amp;quot;screamo&amp;quot;, in which case I couldn&#39;t tell the difference between the Catholic liturgy and a string of Howard Stern&#39;s rants; to date, there&#39;s only been one instance of having to say something for inappropriate language.&amp;nbsp;
How are the logistics being handled, especially in terms of moving equipment?&amp;nbsp; None of these kids have licenses and if there are gigs &#45; and there are two already lined up &#45; then the odds are that one or more of the fathers are going to add roadie to our job responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; Even if the equipment isn&#39;t being moved, then how are kids getting home and are any of them staying for dinner?&amp;nbsp; Teens are notoriously horrendous planners and it&#39;s reached the point that if I know that there&#39;s going to be a practice, then I&#39;m simply cooking for the&amp;nbsp;band as well as the family.&amp;nbsp; These are the days that work best for crockpot meals.
When the kids &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; these sessions, are they on days when there&#39;s a certifiable adult in the household?&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been adamant that either my wife or I be present and when Middle protested vigorously, quoting the teen battle cry of what could go wrong? I responded that with the presence of several teenage boys, I could return home to find a smoking crater where our house used to be.
These are only the first of the lessons that will arise from this new endeavor.&amp;nbsp; As one father commented to me last weekend, wait until they start bickering.

<title>Stealth Inflation Continues&#8230;</title>
<body>Recent grocery trips continue to demonstrate how the purchasing power of the middle class is eaten away as prices remain constant while packaging changes.
My wife came home recently with a full grocery load and commented that she&#39;d felt taken since the spaghetti that she&#39;d bought on sale was actually now packaged in a 12 ounce box instead of the standard 16 ounce container.&amp;nbsp; The grocer and producer ostensibly held the sale to camoflage the price increase; most people don&#39;t take the time to record prices and wouldn&#39;t catch on that such a product change had been made.&amp;nbsp; The effect is that someone can look at something and swear that they&#39;d paid less for it before, but couldn&#39;t certify that that was indeed the case.&amp;nbsp;
A similar comment was made this week as brand name mayonnaise was purchased on sale with the subsequent realization that product came in a 30 ounce jar instead of the previous 32 ounce jar.&amp;nbsp; The sense now is that when we see products sold at strong sale prices, there&#39;s a decent likelihood that the product will undergo a size decrease.&amp;nbsp;
Another factor that impacts the price is the quality and availability of the component ingredients, such as the &amp;quot;pink slime&amp;quot; that&#39;s been added for years to ground meat.&amp;nbsp; With the recent controversy about the quality and safety of the meat byproduct, more grocers are announcing that they&#39;ll no longer be including the substance in their ground beef product.&amp;nbsp; The same week that Supervalu and Safeway announced that they&#39;d no longer include the byproduct, two regional chains that service our area also announced that their ground beef wouldn&#39;t have the filler.&amp;nbsp; Note that these two chains are part of the three store price index that I&#39;ve followed since November 2010.&amp;nbsp; A month prior to the announcement, in February 2012, these two stores showed significant increases in the price of their 80% lean ground beef and the local store didn&#39;t have the 80% lean for sale at all.&amp;nbsp; The new, higher price is still in effect &#45; duh &#45; but the local store still doesn&#39;t have the 80% lean on the shelf.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot is that another of the factors is the value upon which we place the quality of our food.&amp;nbsp; If we truly want safe food, then there&#39;s going to be a premium that will have to be paid to ensure that the food is safe for consumption.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Staying for the Practice?</title>
<body>You&#39;re pressed for time and the kid has a sports practice.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s at least an hour or more that you can use to run an errand or go home and clean up the kitchen, assuming that the practice is nearby.&amp;nbsp; Do you stay for the practice or do you leave the kid there and get the other stuff done?&amp;nbsp; What could go wrong?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the&amp;nbsp;question that I asked myself tonight and&amp;nbsp;about a minute before I was going to leave&amp;nbsp;to handle another&amp;nbsp;item, Youngest&amp;nbsp;caught a pitched baseball in his windpipe, providing me with about five solid seconds of&amp;nbsp;pure terror as he struggled to regain his breath.&amp;nbsp; After a few minutes of gasping and gagging, he was able to return to the catcher&#39;s position and finished the practice there and&amp;nbsp;upon returning&amp;nbsp;home, Mom the physician administered ibuprofen to control any swelling and had him on the sofa with ice on his throat for a full half&#45;hour.
What could go wrong?
We want our kids to try different things and find something that they love, something&amp;nbsp;that helps them to thrive and grow.&amp;nbsp; If the activity is a sport, then we outfit them with the necessary gear and haul them to the practices and games; we cheer for them or coach them, all the while understanding that a sport has some inherent risk of injury.&amp;nbsp; For many sports, it&#39;s likely to involve bruises from incidental contact or some muscle injury and that&#39;s simply a part of life.&amp;nbsp; Our household has witnessed balls to the face, significant bruising and more than one trip to the orthopedist for serious sprains and torn knee cartilage.&amp;nbsp; These however, are injuries that aren&#39;t potentially life&#45;threatening and when the kids are older at least, can be handled by the coach.&amp;nbsp; My choice &#45; backed by my history &#45; is to stay for the practices whenever possible and I&#39;ll work the schedule accordingly to make it happen.&amp;nbsp; This night was one of the few that I figured would be okay to be gone.&amp;nbsp; So what have I considered and learned&amp;nbsp;since the throat incident?

    What&#39;s the level of play for the sport in question and how old are the kids?&amp;nbsp; At the rec league level, the coaches are all volunteers whose own kids are involved in the sport.&amp;nbsp; While coaches, they have a parent&#39;s perspective but are responsible for the entire group in addition to their own.&amp;nbsp; A child who&#39;s suffered an injury is usually different from a teenager since there&#39;s likely to be a strong emotional overlay caused by fear and that can fully engage an adult&#39;s attention.&amp;nbsp; Toss in a serious injury and the rest of the kids on the team are liable to require greater attention as well and you can say goodbye to any actual practice.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re at a scholastic level, then the kids are under the care of the school, which has protocols for injury.&amp;nbsp; At the scholastic level, the practices will be likely held at a time where you&#39;re still at work.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the kids are old enough that there&#39;s sufficient maturity and experience to carry them through the initial situation without your presence.
    What are the precise equipment needs?&amp;nbsp; After two years of request, we permitted the grandparents to purchase catcher&#39;s equipment for Youngest and that equipment came in a single set.&amp;nbsp; I failed first in not knowing specifically what baseball catchers required for safety and secondly, in assuming that the set included everything necessary for the youngster.&amp;nbsp; At a certain level of play, boys do require a cup and athletic supporter but I didn&#39;t realize that there was a throat guard for baseball catchers.&amp;nbsp;
    Do I actually have my cell phone in the event that I have to leave and something goes wrong?&amp;nbsp; If I have to leave one of my kids at a practice and in the care of the coach, it&#39;s my responsibility to at least be accessible.
    Do my kids actually know any of the other parents there?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;ll be easier for the hurt child if at least there&#39;s another adult face that they know apart from the coach.

Tonight&#39;s incident was a dodged bullet, and the bullet was a potential hollow&#45;point for what might have happened.&amp;nbsp; The throat guard&#39;s purchase will be an immediate fix, but I&#39;ll think even harder next time I&#39;m in the position of having to decide whether to miss a practice.

<title>Evaluating the Credit Card Offers</title>
<body>With Eldest leaving for college inside of six months, the nascent&#45;adult mail has started to flow and one of the pieces to her the other day was a credit card application from First Financial Bank USA.&amp;nbsp; The bank is a credit card provider that specializes in credit for college students and touts itself as a leading quality provider of credit for new credit users.&amp;nbsp; Inside the envelope was a letter to the kids, a separate note to parents and a sticker sheet showing all of the options available to personalize the front of the student&#39;s new card and the obvious message is that it&#39;s a great time to get your first credit card so that you can learn to manage credit and build your infant credit history.
But is it really a great time to do that?
What bothers me about the continued marketing of credit&amp;nbsp;to our young people is that it&#39;s a recipe for life in an economy requiring a completely different mindset than before.&amp;nbsp; You need to understand something about the credit explosion of the past sixty years &#45; it lubricated and accelerated the shift in our economy from an industrial spending base to a consumer spending base.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the Second World War, government and business leaders were at a crossroads and knew that signficant changes had to be made in the economic drivers.&amp;nbsp; From the Industrial Revolution until the Great Depression, economic growth had been predicated upon capital investment spending by business as the country grew and was developed.&amp;nbsp; That spending utterly collapsed in the Depression and despite the best efforts by FDR to get liquidity into the system via government spending, a traumatized American consumer literally threw the money into the mattress as protection for any further problems.&amp;nbsp;
At the end of WWII, the public debt was stretched by payment for the war effort and the government wasn&#39;t seen as a viable alternative for economic growth and all eyes turned to the American Consumer to lead the way out.&amp;nbsp; The birth of the modern credit card &#45; Diner&#39;s Club &#45; led to a realization that available consumer credit was a great way for the average American to lever his growing income into spending that could reshape the economy.&amp;nbsp; The fact that the US government allowed individuals to deduct their credit card interest from their income taxes until the mid 1980s was proof positive that consumer credit was a policy tool to push spending.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;re now at the point at which families not only have to delever &#45; pay off the debts &#45; but learn to live within their means and relearn that they themselves are the ones responsible for their own retirement and future; this is all within the framework of lessened income growth.
I&#39;ll admit that the marketing to college students, the majority of whom now have their own credit cards, is better than it was.  Prior to the passage of the CARD (Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure) Act of 2009, card issuers enticed students to their cards with such freebies as mugs, frisbees and t&#45;shirts and the kids lapped it up; it was only after they began to receive the bills that they realized what they were in for.  Colleges that permit marketing to students on campus are obligated to certain requirements and the shiny bangles that captured the attention of the previous generation of students are now gone.  The CARD Act of 2009 went some way to cleaning up certain wild&#45;west aspects of the retail credit industry.  On the offering side, it did end the superficial bangle show that captured the fancy of many young adults.  On the billing side, it also mandated that bills sent to cardholders show such things as the length of time required to pay off the amount owed if only the minimum amount was paid.  This particular aspect alone was eye&#45;opening for new users as they realized that making only the monthly minimum was a long&#45;term financial hemorrhage.
One of the lines sold to the American consumer is that credit is simply another form of liquidity and that if you don&#39;t have the money now, just use the plastic and pay it off later.&amp;nbsp; The problem is that the liquidity isn&#39;t yours but someone else&#39;s and that someone will demand repayment.&amp;nbsp; This is particularly hazy to the youngsters who haven&#39;t the experience to fully comprehend this and are generally flush with the new&#45;found personal and financial freedom that comes with college.
In the case of the offer to Eldest, the only thing that we had to do was show her the APR of 29% and she immediately blanched.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t necessary to show her the misleading commentary nor take her to cardoffers.com, a website that offers side&#45;by&#45;side comparisons of the various cards available as well as cardholder comments critiquing their card.&amp;nbsp; In the case of First Financial Bank USA, there were more than 130 comments and the majority were strongly negative.&amp;nbsp; When it finally becomes time for Eldest to consider a card, then we&#39;ll go to that site and parse through the card language to better understand the product.&amp;nbsp; For now however, she&#39;s best served going through at least part of college without a credit card.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;ll be forced to manage her cash and even learn to do without and if she&#39;s pressed, her mother and I are only a phone call away.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Cannibalizing Our Young</title>
<body>There&#39;s a recurrent&amp;nbsp;theme in&amp;nbsp;which a society, facing defeat, responds by using its youngsters &#45; the seed corn &#45; as a means of keeping itself alive.&amp;nbsp; Whether it&#39;s the Germans in World War II or the Confederacy after 1864, the image is one of teens&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;children sent to the front line to stave off an inevitable defeat.&amp;nbsp; This is&amp;nbsp;recently brought to mind as separate sources&amp;nbsp;converged to illustrate that our present&amp;nbsp;financial system is facing&amp;nbsp;the destruction of its&amp;nbsp;profitable bubble model as it now&amp;nbsp;extends faux&#45;friendly credit to the young and then feasts on them when they cannot repay.
The first source was a brief Fitch Ratings release&amp;nbsp;that discussed the safety of Asset&#45;Backed Securities composed of student loans.&amp;nbsp; The size of the student loan pool is now greater than auto notes and credit cards and is in the vicinity of $1 Trillion and according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, approximately 27% of these loans &#45; more than a quarter of a trillion dollars &#45; are now more than 30 days past due.&amp;nbsp; Of this amount, more than $67 Billion in student loans are more than 270 days in arrears, which is a technical default.&amp;nbsp; Student loan backed ABS products are no different from their well&#45;known cousin, the Mortgage Backed Securities products in that the cash flow stems from the cumulative payments of all of the borrowers as they repay their loans.&amp;nbsp; Like the MBS however, there was a glut of lax loans made and more are now in default.&amp;nbsp; The bulk of the poor lending was done by the for&#45;profit institutions whose admissions and financial aid people directed prospective students into taking on excessive loans and several years later, with the education finished and insufficient income, the student borrowers are going into default.&amp;nbsp; The for&#45;profit colleges, such as Phoenix, made money while the students are held to account.  For the record, the graduation rate at the for&#45;profits is 22%, less than half of that for public universities.&amp;nbsp;
Fitch&#39;s good news however, is that the ABS are relatively safe for two reasons.&amp;nbsp; First, the products were structured in a better fashion with greater contractual protection.&amp;nbsp; Second, the Federal government is backing the loans in multiple ABS via the FFELP (Family Federal Education Loan Program), under which the large majority of the loans were written.&amp;nbsp; This is great for the owners of the ABS, which happen to be almost entirely corporations and financial institutions.&amp;nbsp; For the actual individuals in the picture &#45; those who are carrying the defaulting loans &#45; it isn&#39;t great as the Federal government expects to get the money back.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Corporations profit (for the win again!) as the US Department of Education is shelling out more than $1 billion in commissions&amp;nbsp;to private contractors to collect on the deficient loans.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, these contractors are wholly&#45;owned subsidiaries of such stalwarts as JPM and Sallie Mae.&amp;nbsp; One of the most glaring comments in the article was that a person in arrears on both taxes and student debt found the IRS to be more compassionate and willing to consider alternatives than the student debt collector; the IRS handles its collections issues internally.
The collections issue stems from the high&#45;pressure methods and threats used on the individuals.&amp;nbsp; Bloomberg personalizes its story by focusing on a person in default, a disabled man who is 52 years of age; but the reality is that most of the students in default, of whom there are more than 5 million, are young adults.&amp;nbsp; These are not the life&#45;experienced, uber&#45;organized seniors but that group of adults with the least experience and cohesiveness; these are the adults with the fewest self&#45;sufficient job opportunities and yet will be hounded into their adult years.&amp;nbsp; Their lives will be dogged and their ability to form households, which is crucial to any true recovery in the housing/construction sector, will be crippled for years to come as their meager financial resources are stripped.
People should be responsible for their debts.&amp;nbsp; But there is a systemic aspect here as those who are least experienced and able to evaluate the alternatives are most pressed to take on debt to better themselves and prepare for their future.&amp;nbsp; When the debt is incurred and the kids&amp;nbsp;are into the world &#45; without the opportunities available to previous generations &#45; the pressure is on to honor the debt payments regardless of their circumstances and ability to pay.&amp;nbsp; The individuals will be hounded and threatened, while the entities which do the hounding are part of a group which increasingly ignores its own contractual obligations, dragging out payments, ignoring deadlines and gaming the system in any way to further their own fortunes at the expense of the whole.
In permitting a system to enslave and wreck the lives of a large segment of our young, we&#39;re cutting off our own national future.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve allowed a system to develop that is cannibalizing society&#39;s future productive members, harnessing them to debts that will take years to satisfy and barring their ability to create their own households and families, the things that are crucial to the vitality of our country.&amp;nbsp; The combination of expensive higher education and harsh debt is certainly profitable in the moment.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s continuance will prove to be its own destruction as fewer are able to participate and the weight of the process will collapse.&amp;nbsp; If we permit the present system to eat our young now, there won&#39;t be enough productive members &#45; or opportunities &#45; to support a vibrant society and economy in the future.

<title>Boots on the Ground Economics:&nbsp; Observing Change</title>
<body>If you follow the news, you&#39;re going to hear that the jobs data shows a solid performance&amp;nbsp;and that with the stock market at post&#45;2008 highs, the economy has turned the corner and we&#39;re on the mend.&amp;nbsp; But you look around or listen to others and the sense is that what&#39;s reported doesn&#39;t jibe with the reports.&amp;nbsp; Can you trust the news or is there a discrepancy?&amp;nbsp; How do you check what CNBC and Fox Business are throwing out?&amp;nbsp; You have two options.&amp;nbsp; The first is to go to the source material for the news reports themselves and the second is to simply pay attention to the small indicators around you.
There&#39;s an increasing distrust of the main&#45;stream media, and that&#39;s especially if you get your economic news from cable sources such as Fox Business or CNBC.&amp;nbsp; The beauty of the internet is such that you can review the sources for these stories and we&#39;ll take a gander at the US Bureau of Labor Statistics&amp;nbsp;news release that provided the source for the HuffingtonPost.com article.&amp;nbsp; In the press release, the private payroll job rise actually came to 233,000 jobs instead of the 277,000 jobs overall that the HuffPo article referenced.&amp;nbsp; Of these 233,000:

    45000 were in the temporary employment sector (19%);
    41000 were in the food service sector (18%);
    61000 were in the health sector (26%).

More than a third of these job&#45;finders are working for minimum wage/tips or no benefits while a full quarter of the job recipients are in a sector that&#39;s heavily dependent upon government spending.&amp;nbsp; With the government spending a deficit greater than $1 T annually and attention sure to be paid to the Medicare/Medicaid budget segments &#45; anybody notice the television commercials announcing the campaign against Medicare fraud &#45; is there doubt that these programs will undergo significant reform in the future?&amp;nbsp; When this happens, the healthcare sector will be rocked and that sector will go flat at best.
If you sense that people are continuing to cut back or feeling the pinch, this macro&#45;level view helps explain why that&#39;s the case.&amp;nbsp; The jobs are there, but they aren&#39;t the jobs that our grandparents, or even our parents, had and there&#39;s no advancement future in a temporary position.
The other way to check out what&#39;s going on is to simply pay attention to what&#39;s going on around you.&amp;nbsp; A look at the state of youth sport programs in my area is a clear indicator of our situation.&amp;nbsp; Eldest has played soccer since elementary school and has participated in the area&#39;s rec soccer league; she&#39;s good enough that she&#39;ll actually play Division III women&#39;s soccer when she attends college in the fall.&amp;nbsp; Through all of that time, there have been teams at age levels from pre&#45;K to U&#45;19 and three years ago, the local rec league participation was strong enough that the U&#45;19 (females between 15 and 19) level fielded three teams.&amp;nbsp; Two years ago, that division could field two teams of about 14 players apiece but with other activities and part&#45;time jobs, there were games in which Eldest and her teammates played Ironman soccer, down a player for the entire game with no substitutions.&amp;nbsp; When Spring sign&#45;up arrived again, I contacted the league and found that the U&#45;19 division was defunct because there weren&#39;t enough to field even one team.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s is cyclicality in any activity and I chalked the situation up to that.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, Eldest asked to play for a nearby area&#39;s soccer club in order to keep her skills up and she signed up for that team instead.
When no notice that any first practice was forthcoming, I spoke with that club&#39;s president &#45; who was also going to be coaching Eldest&#39;s team as well &#45; about the status.&amp;nbsp; After getting the details, we chatted and I discovered that his club, which historically fielded three or four teams at that level, was now down to one team of 19 girls.&amp;nbsp; This is actually more than you want for one well&#45;stocked team but there weren&#39;t enough for two teams and the decision was to turn no girl away.&amp;nbsp; Not only were these two clubs, that used to field five or six well&#45;manned teams, down to only one team, but several of the 19 girls on the squad were like Eldest, soccer refugees from localities that could no longer field teams.&amp;nbsp; What was once an eight or nine team county league was now down to five and this couldn&#39;t be explained by the cyclicality of a single club&#39;s program.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s possible that the decline is due to families opting not to pay for soccer for the older kid because of stretched incomes, but not definitive.&amp;nbsp;
From my perspective, it wasn&#39;t definitive until I had a conversation this weekend with Youngest&#39;s baseball coach.&amp;nbsp; As we watched the boys throw and do warm&#45;ups in the pouring rain, we discussed players and he commented that there were more boys moved up to this level than in any previous year.&amp;nbsp; I mentally ran through the teams and there are as many teams in this level as in previous years, but why were they moving the boys up instead of leaving them at the lower level?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s possible that the younger crop of boys simply has better skills than in previous seasons and that would account for the shift upwards.&amp;nbsp; But given the other conversation with the soccer club president, I suspect that it&#39;s something different and related to money.
There&#39;s a natural winnowing process in sports, in which&amp;nbsp;most children&amp;nbsp;get to try something new.&amp;nbsp; This is how the kids learn what they like or dislike and it helps teach some basic people skills apart from kicking a ball with the instep or loading up before you swing the bat and parents don&#39;t begrudge the opportunity for their kid to have that opportunity.&amp;nbsp; But kids develop preferences as they grow and this contributes to that process; kids also understand more and aren&#39;t stupid to what&#39;s happening with their family.&amp;nbsp; I believe that the increasing stretch of the family budget is increasing the pinch and parents who, two decades before, might have permitted further exploration are now deciding that the kids are old enough to understand and cutting back accordingly.&amp;nbsp; This is exacerbated by gasoline prices at almost $4/gallon and the cost of driving to&amp;nbsp;playing fields all over Hell and half of Georgia.&amp;nbsp; Am I positive that this is the case or am I viewing everything through money&#45;colored lenses?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s impossible to say for certain, but I&#39;ll keep these two Main Street datapoints in the back of my mind as I continue to watch what&#39;s going on.&amp;nbsp; The point of the exercise is to see whether what&#39;s happening on Main Street jibes with what Wall Street &#45; and by extension, the government &#45; says and at what point they diverge.

<title>Having &#8220;the Talk&#8221;</title>
<body>Part of fatherhood is living outside of your comfort zone, at least until you get the hang of whatever new thing that you&#39;re having to do.&amp;nbsp; Changing diapers, learning to discern why your baby is crying, or&amp;nbsp;reading The Idiot&#39;s Guide to Soccer in order to coach a kimdergarten team&amp;nbsp;are all examples of men doing things that they were simply never prepared for.&amp;nbsp; A major topic that takes men out of their comfort zone is having to teach &amp;quot;the birds and the bees&amp;quot; to their children; while most things are easily managed once you get the hang of them, having &amp;quot;the talk&amp;quot; will almost always be nebulous and fraught with uncertainty.&amp;nbsp; It is, however, one of the most important things that a father needs to do and that&#39;s especially at a time when the media extols sexuality and fewer parents seem to monitor their kids.
So what are some of the things to consider?
First, having &amp;quot;the talk&amp;quot; implies that there&#39;s actually going to be a verbal communication between you and your child.&amp;nbsp; As much as I loved my own father, my version involved walking into my bedroom while in middle school and finding a small book about human reproduction lying on my bed with no words or comments ever actually spoken.&amp;nbsp; The result, being one of the 7th grade&amp;nbsp;walking dead, was that I put the booklet on the shelf and continued to get&amp;nbsp;misinformation from my buddies; in today&#39;s world, that&#39;s the worst possible thing that could happen.&amp;nbsp; The fact that I got through unscathed is more of a testament to my own fear of screwing up, literally and figuratively.&amp;nbsp; Your kids want to know that you&#39;re there, that they can depend upon you, and that there&#39;s some stability and that only comes through ongoing efforts at communication.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s helpful to understand that &amp;quot;the talk&amp;quot; isn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be a singular event.&amp;nbsp; There are different aspects including basic informational, aka the parts and the source of babies, then later the physical processes of puberty.&amp;nbsp; The basics of the body parts are&amp;nbsp;something that can be done as early as the toddler and preschool years and a great time to do so is while they&#39;re being bathed, naming the various parts as they&#39;re being washed and rinsed.&amp;nbsp; The keys are repetition and simplicity, using the same terminology again and again until the kids are able to use the language themselves.&amp;nbsp; Simplicity means that you focus on the basic, visible body parts such as the penis or the vulva/vagina (actually, the vagina is inside the female and the vulva on the outside).&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t worry about what isn&#39;t visible because at those ages, out of sight truly is out of mind but also expect to have to go over it multiple times until they&#39;ve got it pat.
Since I was responsible for bathing the kids before my wife could make it home, one of&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;earliest questions that I faced&amp;nbsp;with a young toddler was whether I should use the names for the anatomy &#45; nipple, penis &#45; or&amp;nbsp;cute nicknames instead.&amp;nbsp; My own parents used nicknames, but after considering it and chatting&amp;nbsp;with my wife, we decided to use the proper terminology.&amp;nbsp; There were several reasons for doing this:

    Different parents might use different names and I clearly recall using the family nicknames in front of kids who laughed in my face;
    I likewise recall hearing friends use their family&#39;s phrasing &#45; or even the proper terms &#45; and having no idea what they meant;
    It sets the standard for the years to come that in some matters, particularly involving the body and sexuality, I was clearly the parent and not a buddy or someone who spoke on the same level as their peers;
    Using nicknames might send the signal that there&#39;s something wrong or embarrassing with it, so you shouldn&#39;t use the proper name;
    It simply felt right as using cute terms made me feel ridiculous.

This isn&#39;t about shame or something from the magical land of wonders.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s about body parts.
This earliest phase is also a time to start working on the basics of child safety, particularly regarding who&#39;s allowed to touch their &amp;quot;private parts.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The littlest ones should hear very simple and consistent instructions with the catchphrase, tell Daddy and Mommy right away.&amp;nbsp;
Explaining where babies come from is a very personal choice, but remember one thing:&amp;nbsp; just because kids want to know something doesn&#39;t mean that they want or need the full details.&amp;nbsp; Bill Cosby&#39;s comment on children and information is spot on:&amp;nbsp; Daddy, why is there air?&amp;nbsp; To blow up basketballs, honey.&amp;nbsp; In our case, the kids knew at an early age that babies came from their mother but didn&#39;t bother with the how and&amp;nbsp;why until much later and that was the cue to go into the larger questions of love and sex &#45; commitment, love, marriage.&amp;nbsp; These didn&#39;t have to be lengthy conversations and in fact, could be simple comments passed back and forth.&amp;nbsp; When Eldest was a preschooler, we&#39;d chat at the table and she stated consistently that she&#39;d have a baby and then get married; my likewise consistent response was that marriage came before the baby and this dance continued until she further understood the idea of marriage.&amp;nbsp;
Don&#39;t assume that the natural progression of the conversation is (1) body parts, (2) puberty/processes and (3) greater meaning of love and sex.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that most kids have little interest in the inner workings of the human body and view it like a TV set:&amp;nbsp; I just wanna make sure that it works when I press the power button.&amp;nbsp; Before they&#39;ve reached that point of intellectual interest, they&#39;ll have many encounters with both the media and unmonitored kids who push a physical, consequence&#45;free view of sex so it&#39;s important that you start your conversations with them early and often.&amp;nbsp; The point is to speak with them repeatedly and it can occur anywhere the opportunity presents itself, while riding in the car or under the driveway basketball pole.&amp;nbsp;
There will come a point at which you do have to start talking to them about the changes that will start happening with puberty.&amp;nbsp; Puberty isn&#39;t&amp;nbsp;a single event at which they&#39;re suddenly adults and as I recall it, it sure as hell isn&#39;t a&amp;nbsp;magical time, either.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a years&#45;long process&amp;nbsp;in which the body&#39;s&amp;nbsp;hormonal chemistry can change long before a hair sprouts on a face or a&amp;nbsp;breast grows and it&#39;s best that they have some clue of coming before they experience a physical event &#45; wet dream or period&amp;nbsp;&#45; for which they&#39;re wholly unprepared.&amp;nbsp; You can handle it like a seminar discussion with the child at the kitchen table for that specific&amp;nbsp;purpose or you can look for clues or comments that it would a good time&amp;nbsp;to broach the subject.&amp;nbsp; One son&#39;s comment that he couldn&#39;t sing as&amp;nbsp;high as&amp;nbsp;a few months ago led to a conversation about&amp;nbsp;the physical aspects of puberty.&amp;nbsp; The point is to have the conversations and they need to be sooner than later.
One aspect of&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;the Talk&amp;quot; that fathers face is&amp;nbsp;whether, what and how much to discuss with daughters.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fortunate in that&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;wife had discussions with my daughter and most men are in the same boat.&amp;nbsp; For those men who don&#39;t have the luxury of an&amp;nbsp;adult&amp;nbsp;woman in his daughter&#39;s life, then it truly is imperative to determine how&amp;nbsp; you want to go about it.&amp;nbsp; There really is a gender divide here and it&#39;s phenomenally uncomfortable for a father to talk about&amp;nbsp;female sexual health&amp;nbsp;with his daughter; when I consider the prospect of having to have done that, the concept of having my tongue ripped out isn&#39;t so bad&amp;nbsp;and the daughters find it uncomfortable as well.&amp;nbsp; In these cases, you have three options:

    Get your information straight and enter the conversation yourself;
    Sit down with your daughter and a woman that both you and your daughter trusts, such as another family member,&amp;nbsp;school nurse or a teacher;
    Arrange for the girl to sit down separately with that trusted woman while you remove yourself from that part of the process.

The point is that this is a bridge that must be crossed because the repercussions of not crossing it are high.&amp;nbsp; Even if you leave the female sexual health to the mother or another woman, there&#39;s no reason that you shouldn&#39;t be involved in every other aspect with your daughter.&amp;nbsp;
The point of this article isn&#39;t to slam using a book or booklet to teach about puberty and the facts of life.&amp;nbsp; The point is that this topic isn&#39;t a one&#45;off event but repetitive over the course of years and that it can&#39;t be covered solely by giving your kid printed material.&amp;nbsp; The book is helpful in assuring that the information is correct and consistently presented and many parents hit the puberty aspect by reading such a book with their children.&amp;nbsp; But a book alone won&#39;t ease a child&#39;s fear that the experience of a new event is harmful or that they&#39;ve done something wrong, nor will it present your values and place situations in the proper context.&amp;nbsp; It might even be especially helpful for you to read so that you don&#39;t goof and refer to a female reproductive organ as a Filipino Tube.
If men are going to truly take an equal role in the raising of the kids, then they must reconcile themselves to the notion that they have as important a role as the mother in teaching about the body, reproduction and sex.&amp;nbsp; Now go shoot hoops with the third grader and see what conversation evolves.</body>

<title>What to do?&nbsp; Managing Panhandlers</title>
<body>Tonight was an evening spent with Youngest at Disney&#39;s John Carter on Mars, one of the rare exceptions that I bent the rule on taking a child to a PG&#45;13 movie before their 13th birthday.&amp;nbsp; The action and special effects were excellent, but we spent some time sitting in the seats afterwards as I explained some of the background for the thousand year conflict in which the hero suddenly found himself.&amp;nbsp; When we left the theatre at 10:30 and entered the parking lot, I found myself, and Youngest, alone and being stopped by a panhandler with a sad tale of woe and in search of bus fare.&amp;nbsp; What to do?&amp;nbsp; What do you do in one of those distinctly unpleasant situations when you&#39;re with your child?
As he approached, I stopped and he at least had the common sense to stop several feet away and not close any further.&amp;nbsp; He immediately went into his story about being stranded and in need of bus fare to somehow make it home to another county, despite being more than three miles from our local bus station.&amp;nbsp; As he plunged onwards into the story, I stood between him and Youngest and simply told Youngest to immediately go back into the lobby to wait for me.&amp;nbsp; The boy, who recognized that something was wildly amiss, complied without question and I heard him walk back.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The panhandler was probably in his early twenties, with a closely shorn head and a poor growth of beard upon his chin and cheeks.&amp;nbsp; He was dressed in a loose camo jacket and a baseball cap worn askew on his head.&amp;nbsp; He had a sunken, haggard appearance and as the old expression goes, looked like he&#39;d been ridden hard and put away wet.&amp;nbsp; My frank opinion was that he was a junkie looking for his next hit.&amp;nbsp; Before he could get further along, I simply pulled out my wallet and removed $6 with the comment that that was all that I could spare.&amp;nbsp; He took the money&amp;nbsp;and thanked me, then actually removed his own driver&#39;s license to show that he was legitimate; I have no idea as to whether it was a real or fake ID and frankly couldn&#39;t have cared less at that moment.&amp;nbsp; He muttered about the embarrassment of his situation, then turned and walked off.&amp;nbsp; After seeing him move off into the next row of cars, I turned and returned to the theatre where Youngest was waiting for me in the lobby.
I asked him if he understood what had just happened and he admitted that he wasn&#39;t clear, so I explained.&amp;nbsp; We spoke briefly, then at further length in the car, about panhandling and the fact that many of these stories weren&#39;t true, but intended to elicit sympathy.&amp;nbsp; In the ideal world, we recognize it for what it is and decline, politely at first and more forcefully if necessary.&amp;nbsp; But in the ideal world, you aren&#39;t accompanied by a child and this guy was smart enough to understand that his success rate rose in the presence of a child.&amp;nbsp;
When we got home, he did what kids do and immediately launched into the story to his mother.&amp;nbsp; We talked about the situation and&amp;nbsp;I have to agree with her that my acquiescence in forking over a few bucks has reinforced his belief that panhandling parents is more profitable than other targets.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, she acknowledged that I had a good point in handling as I did.&amp;nbsp; Ultimately, Youngest stayed safe and the guy took off as soon as he got some cash.&amp;nbsp; I might even have handled it differently had Middle or Eldest been along instead of Youngest, provided that he&#39;d even had the nerve to approach two or more full&#45;sized people.
There&#39;s a preferred way to handle unpleasant situations like panhandling, and giving over a few bucks isn&#39;t preferred.&amp;nbsp; But having to contend with it while worried about your child&#39;s safety often means that the optimal case isn&#39;t practical in the moment.&amp;nbsp; Time and locale matter and the middle of a crowded city street is different than a darkened late evening parking lot.&amp;nbsp; The best that I could do &#45; as I quickly considered it &#45; was to simply move Youngest out as quickly as possible and avoid any reason for a potential conflict.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I&#39;m frankly embarrassed but Youngest is now safely tucked into bed and tomorrow, when we&#39;re both fresh, we&#39;ll touch base about it again to learn what can be learned.

<category>Discipline</category>
<title>Is Embarrassment a Disciplinary Tool?</title>
<body>Is it ever appropriate&amp;nbsp;to purposefully embarrass a child in order to maintain control or apply discipline?
For all of the talk about how wonderful children are &#45; and yes, they are &#45; there&#39;s another viewpoint and that&#39;s one not discussed unless you&#39;re sitting with a group of parents who are up to their elbows in raising and managing their children.&amp;nbsp; These folks, who do the toting, waiting and cajoling, are hardnosed because they see the unpleasant mess that comes with raising kids and when several parents gather, the philosophies, techniques and tactics naturally arise in conversation.&amp;nbsp; It was in such a gathering that I sat waiting for Youngest and the conversation turned to the question of embarrassing the child in front of her peers.&amp;nbsp;
One parent commented about a recent situation in which the child publicly misbehaved with a group of friends and was&amp;nbsp;immediately chastised in&amp;nbsp;front of the peers for&amp;nbsp;a disciplinary two&#45;fer.&amp;nbsp; Parental discipline was joined by peer embarrassment to lock down the&amp;nbsp;misbehavior.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know the circumstances of the misbehavior,&amp;nbsp;but the correction&amp;nbsp;certainly met the criteria of handling discipline immediately&amp;nbsp;and if the situation was serious in any way &#45; such as bordering on illegality or physically dangerous &#45; then that chastising in the moment would be entirely appropriate.&amp;nbsp; But it was in subsequent conversation that things became unclear.&amp;nbsp; Another parent commented that the presence of friends was immaterial to disciplining her kid and when others agreed, a third parent remarked that embarrassing the child publicly was a potent technique as the kid knew to stay in line when with peers.
I appreciate that last comment about the effect of a kid&#39;s peers.&amp;nbsp; When kids are in groups &#45; and this becomes more problematic towards and during the teen years &#45; the group dynamic can become combustible and raucously out&#45;of&#45;control.&amp;nbsp; Middle&#45;school boys are sometimes only a hairs&#45;width away from devolving into a Lord of the Flies scenario.&amp;nbsp; With more parents either absent or failing to supervise their kids, the potential for misbehavior rises and anything that a frustrated or scared parent can do to put the brakes on errant behavior might seem to be fair play.&amp;nbsp; Both my wife and I have meted out discipline in the presence of friends but only because it had to be handled in the moment and frankly, that discipline extended to the friends as well.&amp;nbsp; If embarrassment arose, then it was purely a by&#45;product of the situation.
To purposefully inflict embarrassment seems to be ultimately counterproductive however.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a point where parents, fathers especially, become an embarrassment by sheer dint of...simply being parents, and fathers especially.&amp;nbsp; Oooohh, lookit that on his face.&amp;nbsp; He always has a few hairs that corkscrew out of his eyebrows like some demented cockroach on a meth bender.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t mind him, he always breathes that way...&amp;nbsp; Given the typically&amp;nbsp;lowered&amp;nbsp;state of parent/child relations in the teen years, it doesn&#39;t make much sense to&amp;nbsp;further antagonise your kid and drive him further out of your sphere of influence.&amp;nbsp; Understand this:&amp;nbsp; if we&#39;re going to raise our children to make their way in the world, then we have to allow them to use the teen years to move into it gradually with support and supervision.&amp;nbsp; This means that we have to recognize and work through all of the various other spheres that will touch upon them during this time.&amp;nbsp; There are people in this world who will happily, like Lampwick from Pinocchio, lead them astray to their own ends and without concern for their well&#45;being and if we purposefully create ill&#45;will, then we create an even steeper slope upon which we must walk.
As I considered the question for this article, I thought about how I&#39;ve handled things with my own kids.&amp;nbsp; When I&#39;ve seen something that requires immediate correction &#45; typically involving a safety issue &#45; then I&#39;ve dealt with it in the moment and the chips fell where they may.&amp;nbsp; But more often than not, I&#39;ve taken the child to the side, such as the other night.&amp;nbsp; In that instance, another kid was there and I pulled mine aside to straighten things out without fuss.&amp;nbsp; However, I also stated that if I witnessed the behavior again, then I would put both of them on the carpet and the chips would fall where they may.&amp;nbsp; The saving grace with this child is that I&#39;ve managed to be consistent enough through the years that a follow&#45;through&amp;nbsp;was certain.&amp;nbsp; In this particular instance, the misbehavior ceased and I didn&#39;t have to follow&#45;through.
Embarrassment is a potent tool, lethal in it&#39;s effect upon a child.&amp;nbsp; My choice would be to treat it as an unfortunate consequence of a necessary correction in the moment, but I wouldn&#39;t utilize it as a sledge to hammer the kid.&amp;nbsp; Staying connected with them through the formative &#39;tween and teen years is difficult enough.

<title>Piling On:&nbsp; Student Loan Rate Increase</title>
<body>With the push for austerity continuing &#45; despite persistently running a pesky trillion dollar budget deficit &#45; the word is out that the government is acting to save several billion dollars by doubling the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans.&amp;nbsp; The Stafford loan is one that&#39;s used principally by lower and middle&#45;income undergraduate students and the subsidized rate &#45; where the government&amp;nbsp;covers the interest cost while the student is in school &#45;&amp;nbsp;is slated to double from 3.4% to 6.8% starting in July 2012.&amp;nbsp;
The public is increasingly aware of the issue of student debt, which has now supplanted both auto loans and credit card debt in magnitude.&amp;nbsp; Couple this with the concept of doubling the interest rate and it&#39;s newsworthy.&amp;nbsp; Before I start my own rant, I thought that it would be good to determine what this means in a real&#45;world situation, for an 18 year old freshman set to attend good ol&#39; Wassamatta U.&amp;nbsp; The parameters of the subsidized Stafford loan are that it has a ten year repayment term with a present rate of 3.4%; a student with dependent status can borrow up to $20,500 cumulatively over four years (Scenario 1)&amp;nbsp;and an independent student with no family support can borrow a total of $57,500 (Scenario 2).&amp;nbsp; Using the  Bankrate.com student loan calculators&amp;nbsp;with these parameters, the monthly repayments&amp;nbsp;are shown below.
Scenario&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3.4%&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6.8%
1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $201.76&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;$235.91
2&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $565.90&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; $661.71
The nominal figures, at least for the kid with dependent status, don&#39;t seem to make much of a difference but those of us reading this are years beyond college and not staring at these bills with a deer&#45;in&#45;a&#45;headlight expression on our faces.&amp;nbsp; There are several things that I take from this situation.
First, while our public spending is clearly out&#45;of&#45;control, a move like this smacks of a public relations move to show the electorate that Congress is on the ball to cut wasteful spending.&amp;nbsp; The problem however, is that this is simply piling on a group that is politically voiceless and powerless because of youth and a lack of experience.&amp;nbsp; The TBTF financial institutions are coddled and sheltered from the consequences of their actions and the middle&#45;class still capable of getting a mortgage can obtain&amp;nbsp;one at a rate&amp;nbsp;less than 4%.&amp;nbsp; But these kids are going to have to accept a doubling of their interest rate.&amp;nbsp; Congress is simply trying to treat a hemorrhaging stump with a three inch gauze pad and medical tape.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve pushed the concept of a knowledge&#45;based economy for years yet when the kids are moving to prepare themselves, many with families that only have limited means to assist them, society and government are&amp;nbsp;stating that they&#39;re on their own.
Second, how far out of touch are the members of Congress from the typical American family with a kid facing the issue of paying for college?&amp;nbsp; The most recent data, as of 2010, shows that the average net worth of a member of Congress rose to $3.8 Million;&amp;nbsp; this is an increase of 23% from 2008.&amp;nbsp; When your financial situation is such that your kids aren&#39;t going to face questions of paying for higher education and you live in a cloistered environment like the nation&#39;s capital, you aren&#39;t going to appreciate the real world, fly&#45;over country consequences of your actions.
Third, there&#39;s a further impact upon the economy.&amp;nbsp; Experts state that one of the large drivers of the economy is the homebuilding industry and construction.&amp;nbsp; However, we have an inventory glut of millions of empty houses and anything that impedes the formation of new households to whittle down that glut is ultimately counterproductive.&amp;nbsp; With kids coming out of school with tens of thousands of dollars in non&#45;dischargeable debt wrapped around their neck, they&#39;ll avoid any thought of forming a new household and the situation is only worsened.&amp;nbsp; Couple that with a higher young adult unemployment rate and lousy prospects and these guys are going to run for the family basement.
While people should be responsible for their own &#45; and their kids &#45; education, the reality is that this nation has a long history of supporting education.&amp;nbsp; The heritage of the land grant universities of the 19th century&amp;nbsp;and the GI Bill of the 20th century demonstrate our&amp;nbsp;ancestors&#39; recognition of the importance of education.&amp;nbsp; This proposed action by Congress is simply an act as short&#45;sighted as these previous Congressional actions were far&#45;sighted.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Splitting Out Food Items from the Marketbasket</title>
<body>The March 2012 PracticalDad Price Index is complete and the results show that while there&#39;s been a slight rise from February&#39;s result of 104.90 to March&#39;s 105.26 (November 2010 = 100), this is still below the December 2011 peak of 106.49.&amp;nbsp; In real terms, the cost of the 47 item marketbasket is now 5.26% higher than the index inception in November 2010.
What&#39;s most notable about the March result is that the price of a pound of 80% lean ground meat has jumped by 10% to $4.14.&amp;nbsp; Nothing else stands out except for peanut butter, which continues it&#39;s rise and is now actually rationed in certain stores.
There&#39;s been an ongoing debate about whether the&amp;nbsp;present economic environment is inflationary or deflationary, with the focus on the most commonly viewed aspect of prices.&amp;nbsp; The data thus far has shown that the market basket peaked in December, 2011 and the subsequent index readings would support a deflationary conclusion.&amp;nbsp; But given the most recent commentary about an uptick in prices, this didn&#39;t jibe with what I&#39;ve seen.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, I&amp;nbsp;re&#45;examined the data and re&#45;calculated the indices &#45; with the same data &#45; at three month intervals but only for actual food items.&amp;nbsp; The market basket is 47 items, but these include non&#45;food products such as diapers, bath soap and household/beauty products.&amp;nbsp;
Month/Year&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Regular Index&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Food&#45;only Index (recalculated)

11/11&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 105.56&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 106.38
02/12&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 104.90&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;107.67
The upshot is that when the non&#45;food items are stripped out of the basket, the food categories (bread, cereal, dairy, grocery, meat, produce and staples) are actually rising and at an increasingly higher rate than non&#45;food categories.&amp;nbsp; As money is continually injected into the system, it&#39;s making the way into the commodities and food arenas with a correspondingly greater effect.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Playin&#8217; at the Crick:&nbsp; Kids, Free Play and Safety</title>
<body>Youngest entered the door from the garage and even around the corner, I could hear the shoes squishing with each step.&amp;nbsp; Dad, he said, I&#39;m really sorry but I just slipped into the creek when I was down there with the guys.&amp;nbsp; My first impulse was annoyance that the kid had gotten his feet wet in the winter, even if it has been an almost Spring&#45;like day.&amp;nbsp; But after listening to him describe his adventures, there was a greater sense of pleasure that the boy was having a Huck Finn experience with his buddies in the out&#45;of&#45;doors and the sneakers simply went into the dryer.&amp;nbsp; Many parents compare their kids childhood with their own and the sense &#45; at least from other fathers with whom I&#39;ve talked &#45; is that there&#39;s far less unregulated and unsupervised play today than before.&amp;nbsp; If we want to encourage this return to some simpler pleasures for our kids, what are some things to bear in mind?
In this age of media&#45;driven angst over child safety, the first and obvious concern is safety.&amp;nbsp; Every parent fears the prospect of a stranger abducting Junior since these cases make the top of each newscast, but the statistics &#45; the most recent that I can find compiled in 2002&amp;nbsp;&#45; show that of approximately 800,000 missing children, 69,000 arise from abduction and of these cases, only about 12,000 were taken by someone not related to the child.&amp;nbsp; While the numbers in 2012 are certainly different, I expect that the general proportions remain the same with only a small percentage of abductions from strangers.&amp;nbsp; Having said that, safety is still the predominant concern.

    I&#39;ve reinforced to the kids that they&#39;re free to go to the creek, in a neighboring municipal park, only with another person and never alone.
    I&#39;ve made it a point to visit the area myself so that I can see what the environment is like.&amp;nbsp; In this particular case, I visited the area &#45; along with other local spots which might be of interest to kids &#45; when we moved into the neighborhood several years ago and am already familiar with where he&#39;s playing.
    Youngest has wanted to show me his &amp;quot;fort&amp;quot; and in the next several days, with decent weather, I&#39;ll take him up on his offer so that I can get another glance at the area in which he and his buddies are playing.
    While this is a small creek, he&#39;s been told that he&#39;s not to be down there after rainstorms because of higher water levels.
    We&#39;ve reviewed basic safety rules, such as might be found at Klaaskids.org.
    The clear expectation is that he&#39;ll only be there after clearing it with me first.
    While I don&#39;t believe that this merits a cell&#45;phone, and others might disagree, it certainly means that he has to have a watch along with which to keep track of time.

We want our son to experience a wide variety of activities but he still needs the ability to simply play with friends.&amp;nbsp; The time spent at the creek is invaluable to his growth and development; he learns to interact with others in a free give&#45;and&#45;take that teaches&amp;nbsp;compromise and resolution and it allows him to exercise his imagination.&amp;nbsp; Where else can he have a fort that boasts a second floor bedroom next to a laser battle station?</body>

<title>Kids and &#8220;the Pill&#8221;</title>
<body>I never let the facts get in the way of a good story.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&aamp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Tom, a friend of the PracticalDad
Just like Tom doesn&#39;t let a fact get into the way of a good story, so Rush Limbaugh didn&#39;t get the facts straight in the face of an opportunity to once again provoke a conservative/liberal spitting contest.&amp;nbsp; The newest &#45; and perhaps most costly &#45; imbroglio arose when Limbaugh took a twenty&#45;something female Georgetown University student to task when she appeared before Congress to press for government coverage of oral birth control, i.e. &amp;quot;the Pill&amp;quot;, for all women.&amp;nbsp; Limbaugh looked at her age and student status, pronounced her a slut and the fight ensued.&amp;nbsp; Despite the wildly poor choice of words, his defenders are stating that the woman was herself disingenuous.&amp;nbsp; The fact lost in the newest skirmish of the culture war is that oral contraceptives actually have benefits apart from the prevention of pregnancy and that it&#39;s not uncommon for its prescription to teenage girls because of these benefits.
Guys truly don&#39;t understand the discomfort and pain that comes with a woman&#39;s period.&amp;nbsp; We can nod our head in sympathy but we&#39;ll simply never get it.&amp;nbsp; That said, something with which fathers should become familiar is the set of facts and processes of the menstual cycle even though the typical father&amp;nbsp;thinks about his daughter&#39;s reproductive health with the same relish that he considers next week&#39;s colonoscopy.&amp;nbsp; Females have dealt with their cycles and periods and your daughter will do the same as she grows and matures, and there are over&#45;the&#45;counter medicines available to assist with the discomfort and symptoms.&amp;nbsp; However, there are occasionally instances in which a woman&#39;s menstrual cycle operates outside the normal Bell Curve in terms of bleeding and period length and in these instances, an oral contraceptive is actually beneficial&amp;nbsp;in regulating the system.&amp;nbsp; In these cases, the medicine &#45; which it is &#45; is prescribed and the fact that the patient might be only fifteen years of age wouldn&#39;t necessarily be material if it helps control the situation and alleviate the symptoms.&amp;nbsp; A man might be philosophically opposed to the idea of a minor receiving an oral contraceptive but that opinion will probably change if he finds that his own child is suffering unnecessarily.
Certain things will jar a father and I suspect that the prescription of an oral contraceptive is near the very top of that list.&amp;nbsp; But what it means is that, even if Mom&#39;s around to ride herd on the process and help the daughter,&amp;nbsp;you need to be at least aware of&amp;nbsp;the daughter&#39;s reproductive health.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that you walk in and start asking about her reproductive organs &#45; Eldest once commented to me that it felt odd that her father could actually talk intelligently about menstruation &#45; but it does mean that you pay attention if the topic is raised, either by your daughter or her mother.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s no mother around, then you simply have to swallow your discomfort and deal with it.&amp;nbsp; Anything that pertains to your child&#39;s health is important to understand, even if you and your mate opt to have a particular sphere of influence by dint of your gender.
Should the government be responsible for covering oral contraceptives?&amp;nbsp; At one glance, perhaps not since the most common usage is for something of convenience rather than necessity.&amp;nbsp; But what Limbaugh and the other pundits need to understand is that when you paint with a very large brush, you also slop over&amp;nbsp;the areas that have no place being painted in the first place.

<title>Andrew Jackson for President</title>
<body>Last night was a night in which the families gathered for the bi&#45;weekly Sunday evening dinner, an event which has preceded the birth of a now&#45;fourth grader and is seeing the eldest of the two broods&#39; half&#45;dozen kids interview for a graduate position in chemical engineering.&amp;nbsp; As kids now move in and out with college and schedules, it&#39;s fascinating when the elder ones return because you can gauge how their thinking is changing.&amp;nbsp; The eldest, the soon&#45;to&#45;be college graduate, was in town and as happens with his presence, the conversation moved to national politics.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s a conservative republican cut from the Alex Keaton mold (yeah, Google that one) but his politics have mellowed a bit as he&#39;s encountered more of the real world.
We discussed the Republican field and it became clear that despite his preference, he was most interested in a Republican who was best able to beat the incumbent.&amp;nbsp; My own opinion is framed by a sense that we&#39;ve officially entered a new age of Robber Barons &#45; yes, I plan to read Janet Tavakoli&#39;s The New Robber Barons&amp;nbsp;after finishing Matthew Josephson&#39;s 1962 history, The Robber Barons&amp;nbsp;&#45; as the MF Global mess has demonstrated how badly the rule of law has been damaged.&amp;nbsp; In this view, the best means of handling the situation and beginning to heal is to aggressively mete out perp walks to those found guilty of fraud and financial malfeasance.&amp;nbsp; The young man looked at me and while I stated that I would prefer&amp;nbsp;another of all of the present candidates, my own preference for a candidate was Andrew Jackson.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re at the stage that the fraud and financial control has become so entwined with governance and the economy that remedying it will require significant pain, akin to undergoing&amp;nbsp;tapeworm removal&amp;nbsp;without benefit of anesthesia; any leader willing to perform such a surgery is someone with a firm sense of right and wrong, the ability to understand the repercussions of not doing the surgery and the courage to withstand the coming firestorm of criticism.&amp;nbsp; I can&#39;t speak for any of the others, but I do know that Jackson did handle a similar situation in our history with the Second Bank of the United States.&amp;nbsp; At a minimum, it contributed to the Depression of 1837, which was itself called&amp;nbsp;the Great Depression by those prior to the 1929 event.&amp;nbsp;
The Second Bank of the United States, a Federal period forebear of the Federal Reserve System, was chartered in 1816 to act as a bank for the nation;&amp;nbsp;it&#39;s charter confirmed that it&#39;s role was to help maintain and regulate a strong currency so that the scattered individual state banking laws were strengthened and standardized.&amp;nbsp; It provided&amp;nbsp;credit to many state banks and held their deposits as well.&amp;nbsp; Like today&#39;s Federal Reserve System, it was an entirely private entity and was perfectly capable of turning a profit for its shareholders and directors.&amp;nbsp; Unlike today&#39;s Federal Reserve System however, the Second Bank of the United States was far more conservative in its management of the currency; today&#39;s Fed governors would be akin to the frontier state bankers and politicians who favored the easier creation of money to fund the exploration, expansion and settling of the frontier.&amp;nbsp; The kicker to the bank&#39;s creation was an that it&#39;s charter was only for twenty years, a political feature designed to placate the original opponents; at the end of twenty years, the charter would be renewed by Congress if it deemed the bank&#39;s performance successful.&amp;nbsp; The federal government itself provided much of the Second Bank&#39;s backing by making it the sole depository of all federal government funds, giving it&amp;nbsp;a huge leg up on everyone else.
Fast forward to the early 1830s and a congressional committee found that the bank had&amp;nbsp;fulfilled its function.&amp;nbsp; However, Jackson &#45; a populist democrat &#45; was bothered by commentary from the bank&#39;s directors as to how much power and pull that they truly exerted and felt that leaving such a function in the hands of a private entity was ultimately fatal to the public good.&amp;nbsp; He vowed to veto the charter&#39;s reapproval.&amp;nbsp; The final conflict came when the bank&#39;s chairman, Nicholas Biddle, decided to put the screws to Jackson for his stance and actually began to pull the credit that it had extended to a number of smaller banks.&amp;nbsp; Cut off from funds, these banks were unable to meet the demands of depositors and a series of bank runs &#45; directly resulting from Biddle&#39;s actions &#45; ensued.&amp;nbsp; An enraged Jackson, and it didn&#39;t take much to anger him in the first place, responded by pulling the government&#39;s deposits from the Second Bank, thus radically diminishing the bank&#39;s strength and ability to extend credit even when necessary.&amp;nbsp; The Second Bank lingered on for several more years before it finally went bankrupt.
Present scholars still debate whether Jackson&#39;s actions actually caused the Panic and Depression of 1837 and some dismiss it as a sideshow, pointing to purely technical factors such as the collapsing price of cotton and/or the capital flow from London.&amp;nbsp; Others ignore the technical side and focus solely on Jackson&#39;s act, placing the blame squarely on his shoulders and absolving Biddle&#39;s actions.&amp;nbsp;
What I take from the episode and its relation to America&#39;s present structure is different however.&amp;nbsp; Our society places great emphasis on specialization and the role of experts, believing that things are better run when the experts are in control.&amp;nbsp; Bloggers such as Yves Smith&amp;nbsp;have well&#45;documented how the economics profession has managed to repackage itself into a Whitman chocolate product, wrapping a soft science&amp;nbsp;center inside of a hard science shell and the result has been that many have simply begun to think of economic and monetary policy as being solely the province of the economic technocrats.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve both forgotten and ignored the fact that the control of a currency is ultimately a political function as it fully impacts all members of the society.&amp;nbsp; Statistics can be used to quantify measurements, but it is ultimately impossible to quantify human behavior in both good and bad forms.
As before, we&#39;ve placed the control of our currency and banking into private&amp;nbsp;fully private hands and it&#39;s now clear that the public interest is being sacrificed by these private interests.&amp;nbsp; The government retains regulatory functions, but these have been neutered by campaign purchase of the political system.&amp;nbsp; Eyes have been averted as unsupervised hedge funds have used high&#45;capacity computers and advanced algorithms to turn the stock market into a literal casino as huge blocks of shares are traded based upon mere price points being reached.&amp;nbsp; The market&#39;s integrity has been affected as on multiple occasions, mechanistic&amp;nbsp;computerized trading has caused the buying pool for a particular company to simply evaporate, resulting in a &amp;quot;flash crash&amp;quot; in which the share price declines dramatically for no rational reason.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A private Federal Reserve System has, to keep a self&#45;interested financial sector afloat, willingly punished savers by pursuing and maintaining artifically low interest rates and willingly pursues expansion of the money supply to devalue the currency so that we can continue to spend profligately and yet manage the massive public debt.&amp;nbsp;
What does any of this have to do with fatherhood and the family?&amp;nbsp; Wouldn&#39;t a Jacksonian response &#45; bringing the monied interests to heel&amp;nbsp;and the Fed under government control &#45; create economic devastation and destroy families as happened in 1837?&amp;nbsp; It certainly would, but it would also bring the monied interests back under public supervision so that such singularly self&#45;interested policies were discontinued.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that this is already contributing to the destruction of families as the American Middle Class is whittled away and the opportunities for our children are eliminated.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the evening, I sat at an empty table and considered the future for our six children and then for all of the other kids that they know and without the rule of law embodied by our Constitution, their collective future is truly bleak, indeed.&amp;nbsp; Without that Constitutional rule of law, reclaimed by Jackson, what would have happened on the subsequent questions that we&#39;ve addressed so well &#45; slavery, women&#39;s suffrage, civil rights?&amp;nbsp; Where would we have stood when Hitler rose to power if we permitted a few private individuals to gain control of the levers of government in 1837?
There&#39;s already pain in our society.&amp;nbsp; The question now is whether we are able to rouse ourselves and re&#45;commit to our civic duties.&amp;nbsp; If we cannot do and endure what&#39;s required, then our children will truly face what our forebears feared for their own children, the lack of a meaningful future.</body>

<title>Kids and the Economic Future</title>
<body>A significant part of my job as a father is to help prepare my children for life in the great, wide world.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s challenging enough with the constant societal change and the impact of their peers, but how do I help raise them for the future if that future is fundamentally different from the past and present&amp;nbsp;with which I have experience?&amp;nbsp; This is the situation faced by millions of American parents who grew up in a world&#45;class economic powerhouse and are now suddenly experiencing the tectonic shifts that are afflicting and winnowing the middle class.&amp;nbsp;
This was noted in a Bloomberg article chronicling the economic stresses faced by Wall Streeters who&#39;ve lost the significant bonuses that helped them maintain a certain lifestyle.&amp;nbsp; The money quote is from Andrew Schiff, a fund spokesman who comments I wouldn&#39;t want to whine.&amp;nbsp; All I want is the stuff that I always thought, growing up, that successful parents had.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Schiff is bringing home around $200k annually but to be fair, is stuck living in New York City, an exceptionally high cost of living area; note that his 1200 square foot abode is about $1.5 Million and that&#39;s close to eight times the cost of something equivalent in my area.&amp;nbsp; Leaving aside the political and economic angst about fairness and the 1%, there are some points to be made here.
The first point is the simple mismatch of expectations with economic reality.&amp;nbsp; Thirty years ago, almost two&#45;thirds of American workers could depend upon defined benefit pension plans to aid them in their retirement.&amp;nbsp; Less than one fifth of American workers can factor that into their planning today.&amp;nbsp; My late father was one who was assured of a pension&amp;nbsp;and my mother still receives a monthly pension check from his employer.&amp;nbsp; If you think that kids don&#39;t pay attention to what fathers say, I can recall mine telling me &#45; when I was in my teens &#45; that I probably wouldn&#39;t be assured of having a pension and once the 401k plans were introduced, I was certain that the old man was right again.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t teach your kids about the world if you aren&#39;t paying attention to what&#39;s happening around you and evaluating &#45; and re&#45;evaluating &#45; it.&amp;nbsp; With college upcoming, we explained to our kids that the college options were limited by the absence of a pension and our need to help assure that we don&#39;t wind up living in their basement.
The second point is the consumerist mentality of many Boomers and Gen&#45;Xers.&amp;nbsp; Starting in the post&#45;World War 2 period, American Business &#45; and Government &#45; ramped up the consumer spending mantra as an offset to government and business investment spending; it was to serve as an economic driver in lieu of those and clearly, that paid off as now our personal savings rate is minimal and everyone looks to the US consumer to carry the global economy.&amp;nbsp; That a teenager looked at the material&amp;nbsp;niceties of other parents thirty years ago and evaluated that as worthy isn&#39;t surprising &#45; it&#39;s a testament to the effectiveness of advertising and manipulation.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;re now at the logical endpoint of consumerism, in which we must now make conscious decisions about what&#39;s affordable under our income and what isn&#39;t because we no longer have the income to satisfy the desires ginned up by the advertising machine.
This leads to the third point, which is to evaluate how the parents of our generation &#45; those that Schiff watched &#45; did in their own financial planning.&amp;nbsp; Remember that thirty years ago, about two&#45;thirds of American workers were set up in a pension plan and the understanding was that while it wouldn&#39;t be Easy Street, the basic income was covered.&amp;nbsp; Fast forward to today &#45; actually 2008, for which data is available&amp;nbsp;&#45; and the following is known about our parents&#39; financial health.

    The non&#45;pension median income from saved assets amounted to $1542 annually, or about $128.50 each month.
    Now only 40% of Americans over aged 65 have a pension plan.
    Fully 55% of older Americans rely on Social Security for more than half of their retirement income.

We &#45; Schiff, all of us &#45; watched the great and powerful Oz and didn&#39;t pay attention to the man behind the curtain as he pushed a consumerist mentality.&amp;nbsp; What we saw was existing in an intellectual vacuum with no other information to provide an adequate context for understanding.
This leads to the fourth point, that kids &#45; mine included &#45; like the niceties and can be budding little curmudgeons when they don&#39;t get what they want.&amp;nbsp; But pay attention to kids who&#39;ve seen their families wrecked financially and the wish is that they had their family life again, where there was less parental stress and discord caused by financial issues.&amp;nbsp; The kids want a home, not a house&amp;nbsp;when push comes to shove.
What stays with me more than anything else from Mr. Schiff&#39;s embarrassment &#45; and the guy&#39;s become a poster&#45;child for the Occupy Wall Street crowd &#45; is that it&#39;s my responsibility to teach my children about the world.&amp;nbsp; The schools will take care of the reading and math, with some help and buttkicking from my wife and I, but parents have to take the time to teach them about the world; if we don&#39;t, then those in the corporate world and media will and it won&#39;t be to the ultimate benefit of our children.</body>

<title>Teaching Kids Everywhere</title>
<body>&amp;nbsp;Today was one of those days when a radio PSA actually had an impact as it spurred memories of hauling toddlers everywhere and having them constantly underfoot.&amp;nbsp; The PSA in&amp;nbsp;question is for Born Learning, a public education/advocacy campaign sponsored by the Ad Council and the United Way which promotes the everyday, omnipresent opportunities to teach even the smallest children.&amp;nbsp; The underlying message is that children, from infants onwards, are eminently capable of learning if we&#39;re willing to put it in front of them; the presentation doesn&#39;t have to happen at a table with a book or in any formal setting.
The aired PSA featured a father &#45; guys, teaching about the world is at the heart of fatherhood &#45; chatting with his toddler while driving.&amp;nbsp; He points out a red car &#45; VROOM VROOM! &#45; and talks about color, the fact that the car can go and praises his son when he grasps the concepts.&amp;nbsp; The underlying adult humor is the introduction of the blue police car which will soon give the red car&#39;s driver a pink ticket.&amp;nbsp; It drives the point home that our children are eager to be engaged and the opportunities to teach are literally endless, provided we put forward the thought to notice them and effort to pursue them.
What are some of the things that you can do?

    When you carry your baby up the stairs, quietly count them as you go.
    When you pick something up, simply state what it is and perhaps sound out the first letter (A is for Apple).
    If you see a bright color, state what that color is and see if your child can repeat or sound out the word.
    An example from the website is having your child hand you a specified number of something when you request (Please hand me three eggs...)

Consider this if you don&#39;t think that what you do is really having an impact.&amp;nbsp; The starter on my wife&#39;s car died this weekend and through the course of a teen&#45;directed scenario, it was ultimately replaced by a 20 year&#45;old friend of Eldest&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; As he dismantled the air intake and removed the air filter to even reach the starter, we chatted and I found that this young man had been under cars with his own father from the time that he was less than&amp;nbsp;two years old.&amp;nbsp; His story was confirmed by someone else there and while I don&#39;t recommend taking Junior the toddler under the chassis, it goes to the heart of the fatherhood experience.&amp;nbsp; Your job is to teach and along with the mundanities outlined, you can include your kids in your own favorite activities and use that to bring them along.
Your infant&#39;s mind is akin to a blank canvas sitting in a studio.&amp;nbsp; By pure dint of living, that canvas will be filled with all manner of media, figures and images.&amp;nbsp; Your job as a father is not to paint that canvas, but to help direct and guide the child as she fills the canvas, providing suitable imagery for the work &#45; do you really want your kid channeling Chris Rock? &#45; and helping to establish a context so that everything becomes coherent, enabling the child to gain a full appreciation for her world.&amp;nbsp; The unfortunate reality is that if you aren&#39;t going to do it, there are plenty of others out there who will happily take on the project, but the materials won&#39;t be satisfactory and it won&#39;t be in the child&#39;s best interest.
Get started, she&#39;s waiting.

<title>PracticalDance Moms:&nbsp; Kids, Parents and Coaches</title>
<body>With only one cable&#45;connected television in the house and not much interest, I generally let the choice of programming to others in the family.&amp;nbsp; But my one gotta&#45;see&#45;this&amp;nbsp;show is Lifetime&#39;s Dance Moms, a &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; show that sends up the thoroughly over&#45;the&#45;top behavior of hovering stage moms who&#39;ve invested everything in helping their pre&#45;teen daughters achieve their dreams of becoming dancers.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the latest installment in television&#39;s Women&#45;Behaving&#45;Badly programming genre and is yet another shot at mothers who&#39;ve opted to stay out of the workforce.&amp;nbsp; However, it&#39;s insanely entertaining and in it&#39;s way, does raise questions about parental expectations, behaviors and how we should handle ourselves with kids and coaches.
As a full disclosure, let me state that two of our three kids have been on stage and one is now starting to toy with the notion of the theatre as a career.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve taken kids to auditions and the one child has had two years of dance classes, so my wife and I have seen examples of parents with their ears to the closed audition doors.&amp;nbsp; When my wife took Middle to a theatre audition and saw the behavior of some of the parents there, she quietly told him that she&#39;d stay in her seat and be cool and he thanked her.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no reason that our child&#39;s reaction is any different from any other child, who&#39;s typically embarrassed simply by the fact that their father is breathing so loudly.&amp;nbsp;
Going to games and performances isn&#39;t being a stage&#45;parent&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
A friend&#39;s daughter has a good role in the middle school play, which has only two performances in one weekend.&amp;nbsp; She contacted me last week and asked &#45; since she referred to me as an &amp;quot;experienced stage&#45;dad&amp;quot; &#45; whether we went to only one performance or more than one.&amp;nbsp; My thought was that she appeared to be concerned about being perceived as a stage&#45;mother; my response was that if was only two shows, see them both since she wasn&#39;t likely to see her in that role again.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, seeing your kid in a public event &#45; game, concert, play, whatever &#45; is something that parents should be doing and isn&#39;t even close to being a helicopter parent.
There are excellent reasons to not go to something, such as work or competing kids&#39; events.&amp;nbsp; If the child is in a theatre production with several weeks of performances, even reduced&#45;rate&amp;nbsp;tickets are cost&#45;prohibitive.&amp;nbsp; But the great majority of kids want their parents and family there, so long as they behave and that&amp;nbsp;is the issue with the stage&#45;parent.&amp;nbsp; Being a responsible, caring parent means that you should support the kid as she explores new interests; it lets you see how she&#39;s developing and frankly, it&#39;s fun.
Consider the level of the activity and the coach&#39;s qualifications
The great majority of kids will roll in and out of any number of different activities and with such a wide variety offered, the lion&#39;s share of the work will fall to volunteer parents.&amp;nbsp; There are always coaches at the various levels who&#39;ve never played the game and if these folks weren&#39;t interested, then the activities simply wouldn&#39;t happen.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re managing things on the run with their own families and work and they simply don&#39;t deserve the crap that they&#39;re something dished.&amp;nbsp; If your kid is playing baseball at the 8 year old level, then you&#39;d better be ready to step up and consider coaching yourself if you don&#39;t like the way that a coach is handling things.&amp;nbsp;
That changes however, as the kids advance and really take to a particular activity.&amp;nbsp; In the Lifetime show, the dance instructor is a professional who requires a contract from each family and is charging them thousands of dollars annually for the highest level of instruction.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s at this point that the parent, as the employer of the independent contractor, does have some claim upon how things are being done.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t the same thing as my hiring a guy to do some construction work; he might have the expertise that I don&#39;t have, but he&#39;ll work solely for me and any issues that we have will be solely between us.&amp;nbsp; A coach of any kind is in a more difficult position since that person is not only responsible for one client, but multiple clients simultaneously and in the same venue.&amp;nbsp; The rancid icing at the top of this cake is that the parents who are paying for this level of attention and expertise are focused heavily on their own child&#39;s development and the potential for personality and interest clash is huge.&amp;nbsp; Potential scholarships, parental aspirations and dreams of the big time make for a potently combustible blend of ambition on the sidelines.&amp;nbsp;
Managing the parental behavior
If you&#39;re at this level of investment, the reality is that you do have a vested interest in the outcome and some word in how things happen.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re hiring the coach for expertise and from that standpoint, you&#39;re best served by just shutting up and letting it happen.&amp;nbsp; But there are other factors in play as well&amp;nbsp;&#45; personality,perceived or real favoritism and parental objectivity.&amp;nbsp; Some folks simply think that every scribble drawn by Junior is someday bound for Sothebys.&amp;nbsp; The issue then becomes how you manage potential conflict; we embarrass our kids simply by breathing the same air as their peers and they&#39;ll&amp;nbsp; probably also possess some loyalty to that coach.&amp;nbsp; After all, if&amp;nbsp;you were so damned smart, you&#39;d be doing this instead of the coach.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
One of the repeated behaviors seen on Dance Moms is the interruption of the practice by one or another mother who&#39;s torqued about something with her child.&amp;nbsp; The mother enters the practice studio as cameras roll and proceeds to question something and the coach responds.&amp;nbsp; The kids are left there to stew in embarrassment and a burning desire to smack mom with a tire iron.&amp;nbsp; While this is reality television, which means that everything is played to the hilt, there are situations in which a parent interrupts a practice or event to publicly register their complaints with the coach; when Youngest signs up for Little League baseball, we parents are obligated to sign an agreement outlining our behavior at practices and games.&amp;nbsp; Just to show that the parental behavior also flows in the other direction, to the child, our local pool decided to make all parents and guardians watch the swimming lessons from beyond the fences several years ago when a mother &#45; angry at her recalcitrant daughter &#45; walked over to the child and threw her bodily into the pool.&amp;nbsp;
While we&#39;re protective of our kids, it&#39;s incumbent upon us to be even more in control of ourselves in these situations.&amp;nbsp; The angry parent will not only offend the person who&#39;s taking on the obligation of working with his child, but will likely also offend other parents as well as embarrass the child in question.&amp;nbsp; Hold off until&amp;nbsp;afterwards and handle things privately&amp;nbsp;and if there&#39;s no progress with whatever situation, then decide if you need to elevate it to the next level, such as the local league or governing body.&amp;nbsp; If the coach is paid, as the dance instructor, then you simply have to decide if the child really is being served best there and if not, go elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; The last thing that you need is the reputation of a dance mom diva.

<title>The Missus</title>
<body>The Big Bang Theory is loaded with subplots as the characters grow and one of the funnier ones is Howard&#39;s developing relationship with Bernadette.&amp;nbsp; Howard &#45;&amp;nbsp;the only one of the four nerds without a doctorate &#45;&amp;nbsp;has met, fallen in love with, and become engaged to Bernadette.&amp;nbsp; In the present story&#45;line, she&#39;s now going to receive her own doctorate and is being lucratively headhunted by a major pharmaceutical firm.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It reflects&amp;nbsp;the gender&#45;bending of our&amp;nbsp;reality as women&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;now able to earn more than men and men are considering their own role with the family; some of the humor is also derived from the reactions and commentary of the peers to this development.&amp;nbsp; This is based upon reality as people do have to come to terms with the concept that the man is filling the role of the Missus &#45; the one who stays home to keep things in order and run the household.&amp;nbsp;
As a &amp;quot;stay&#45;at&#45;home&#45;dad&amp;quot; &#45; and I really dislike the term &#45; I&#39;ve had multiple encounters through the years with society&#39;s efforts to work through the gender&#45;bending implications.

    My wife is a physician and we&#39;ve received mail addressed to Dr. and Mrs. with her name following.&amp;nbsp;
    I&#39;ve been introduced as the wife on more than one occasion, once in front of a group of more than 20 people.&amp;nbsp;
    When the kids were very small, playdates were sometimes a problem as many mothers were uncomfortable with the concept of having a father in a traditionally maternal domain.
    A medical spouse group &#45; which existed to support one another and perform charity work for selected projects &#45; invited me to join them with the hookline if nothing else, you&#39;ll get to meet some very attractive middle aged women.&amp;nbsp; For the record, I didn&#39;t attend.
    There have been multiple jokes in the distant past from other guys about knitting and crocheting, but the last one was about two years ago and even that last remark came from a man who worked as a nurse.

The needs and dynamics&amp;nbsp;of the family have&amp;nbsp;changed dramatically over the past several decades and for several reasons.&amp;nbsp; The first is because of the social change wrought by&amp;nbsp;women who were looking for greater opportunities and freedom than what had been offered to their mothers and the chance to define themselves as more than just a mother.&amp;nbsp; The second is the change in the institution of marriage; the acceptability and ease of obtaining a divorce while more choose to live together outside of marriage.&amp;nbsp; The third is economic as families find that incomes aren&#39;t keeping up and traditionally male&#45;dominated industries &#45; construction and manufacturing &#45; suffered disproportionately because of the most recent recession and globalization.&amp;nbsp; Instead of by choice, necessity is now forcing mothers to step up to the economic plate.
But society&#39;s views haven&#39;t kept pace with the parental and family changes and it&#39;s this discrepancy that provides fodder for The Big Bang Theory.&amp;nbsp; As men take a larger role in child&#45;rearing and the family&#39;s life, the laughs will become harder to mine.&amp;nbsp; Viewers will watch a particular scenario play out and find it less humorous because they can actually identify with something that&#39;s purportedly novel and question why it&#39;s supposedly funny enough to be filling airtime.&amp;nbsp; Reality is forcing us to adapt in ways that weren&#39;t considered by our grandparents and society&#39;s labels are slower to change to those adaptations.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t see that terms such as father, mother, husband and wife will ever change.&amp;nbsp; But the truth is that as men take over greater household and family responsibilities, we&#39;ll render the Missus obsolete.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Critiquing the FAFSA</title>
<body>If there&#39;s anything that drives fear into the heart of a parent &#45; apart from orthodontists &#45; it&#39;s the dreaded FAFSA.&amp;nbsp; This instrument, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, garners the financial information used by colleges to ascertain the size and composition of financial aid packages for students that have applied to college.&amp;nbsp; Listen to enough parents and the sense you get is that it&#39;s an unpleasant, painful necessity, akin to having to complete the last inning of a baseball game when you&#39;re down by more than two dozen runs.&amp;nbsp; C&#39;mon guys, we can do it!&amp;nbsp; We can pull this one out!&amp;nbsp; We can...aw, to hell with it.&amp;nbsp; But is it the creature it&#39;s made out to be and what&#39;s it really like to complete it?
The FAFSA has especially taken on greater meaning in the past two decades as college costs have spiraled upwards, disproportionate to the actual cost of living for everything else.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been told that education is the key to the future&amp;nbsp;in a knowledge&#45;based economy and the income data is clear that kids with college degrees earn more over a lifetime than those with just high school diplomas; parents consequently want to assure that the kids get the education they need to survive, let alone succeed.&amp;nbsp; This instrument is the key tool used by colleges and universities to allocate the available funds amongst the mass of kids and families desiring that key to the future.
FAFSA Basics

    The form for each upcoming school year is available on January 1st of that year; so the 2012 &#45; 13 school year allocations are based upon the FAFSA instrument available on January 1, 2012.&amp;nbsp; Most institutions want the completed data by March 1, so there&#39;s a two month window in which to gather the data and complete the FAFSA.&amp;nbsp; Curiously, this two month window coincides with the peak drinking season of middle&#45;aged men.
    Much of the data collected pertains to demographic and family information.&amp;nbsp; How many other siblings are there and more importantly, are any of them in college?&amp;nbsp; Is the child in question an emancipated minor (did you kick his lazy butt out and have him legally declared an adult at age 11)?&amp;nbsp;
    The actual financial data collected depends heavily upon the family income and non&#45;retirement assets of the family, so you ideally need to have completed the federal taxes when you sit down with the FAFSA.&amp;nbsp; You can complete the instrument with estimates as to your adjusted gross income and colleges will make provisional decisions, but these are subject to revision when the 1040 is submitted.&amp;nbsp; Guess wrong in February and you&#39;re liable to receive an unpleasant surprise in May.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re like most and the bulk of your assets are tied up in retirement funds, then the financial information required is much less onerous than if you own rental properties and have payments from the installments of land sales.&amp;nbsp; Of course, if you have rental properties and payments from land sale installments, you might want to seriously consider bagging the entire process unless you enjoy a good laugh.

Completing the Form

    The form can be completed online and in our case, took less than an hour to complete.&amp;nbsp; Much of the effort on my part came from actually completing and submitting the returns earlier than I normally would.
    The FAFSA now has an electronic download linkage with the IRS so that your relevant tax data can be simply downloaded from the IRS.&amp;nbsp; That said, there is about a two week IRS processing lag so if you&#39;re filing the FAFSA immediately after your taxes, just use a hard copy of the return for reference purposes.&amp;nbsp; The relevant questions will point you to exactly what lines on the forms are required for the actual answers, so it&#39;s not difficult.
    The instrument is actually well laid out.&amp;nbsp; In some sections with a significant number of questions, the system only asks you one question at a time and after you&#39;ve answered and clicked Next, will come up with the next question.&amp;nbsp; That way,&amp;nbsp; it&#39;s assured that all of the questions are answered and you&#39;re assured that your mind isn&#39;t going to be blown by the number of questions (more than 80).
    Because it&#39;s capturing data for a large mass of families, think of a Bell Curve.&amp;nbsp; While there are a lot of questions asked, the large majority of families are within about 80% of the curve and many of the questions are designed to capture information for those at the outlying ends of the curve.&amp;nbsp; Again, it took us less than an hour to complete the form.
    The only paper document that we required was the recently completed tax return.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, we handled it on two laptops as my wife did the form while I used mine to obtain asset values from the bank and 529 websites.
    The completed instrument will only be submitted to those institutions that you specify.&amp;nbsp; While each has its own unique code identifier, there is a search function that allows you to search for, and load, the identifier instead of having to cuss your way through a stack of college correspondence.&amp;nbsp;
    When completing the assets section, there is clarification for the various assets.&amp;nbsp; This is especially helpful if you have a 529 plan and have to allocate it as a student asset or a parental asset.&amp;nbsp; Parsing these definitions were the most complicated part of the entire process.
    The response to the completed paperwork is called the Expected Family Contribution&amp;nbsp;and ours was available shortly afterwards.&amp;nbsp; The EFC is not the final answer for what your child will receive, but it&#39;s a figure that&#39;s used by the college financial aid staff as they calculate what the kid&#39;s offered and what one offers might be very different from another.

FAFSA Comments
Let&#39;s start with the EFC since that provided the greatest laugh of the night.&amp;nbsp; Multiple factors compose the EFC calculation, including the number of kids in the family, assets and income; what struck me was, in a sense, comparability to sitting down with a mortgage broker to discuss what size loan you can afford.&amp;nbsp; In the&amp;nbsp;mortgage case, I&#39;ve had brokers state that we can afford a certain amount while the reality is very different.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, our EFC &#45; and no, I&#39;m not going to share &#45; was such that it would be theoretically affordable if we ignored everything except for the most basic of necessities and frankly, I&#39;m not certain how we&#39;d make it with that.&amp;nbsp; The EFC is a starting point, but not one necessarily grounded in reality.
The instrument itself was straightforward and I&#39;ve had greater issues&amp;nbsp;preparing my state income taxes.&amp;nbsp; The site is well&#45;designed and after finishing it, it was apparent that there&#39;s considerably greater&amp;nbsp;emotional overlay to the FAFSA than actual pain.&amp;nbsp; As we&amp;nbsp;parsed the questions and completed the form, what stayed with me was the question of whether we&#39;d done enough through the years.&amp;nbsp; Could we have saved more?&amp;nbsp; What if I&#39;d invested this way instead of another?&amp;nbsp; How will we manage it when Middle and Youngest are up the plate?&amp;nbsp; And above all, the hard realization that Eldest really is going to be leaving for college in six months.&amp;nbsp; Dear God, she&#39;s leaving...where did the time go?
My father sometimes commented that things were generally much easier if your ducks were lined up in a row first.&amp;nbsp; Take your time, line up your ducks and the FAFSA isn&#39;t going to be a major issue.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s helpful though, to check your emotions at the door.

<title>Friend Time vs. Family Time</title>
<body>Although there are still younger ones in the house, Eldest is now officially in the last semester of her senior year in high school.&amp;nbsp; In the moment of raising kids, it didn&#39;t seem as though it would end but in retrospect, it&#39;s gone quickly.&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s now that I fully understand what other friends have said through the years:&amp;nbsp; I think that he&#39;s gonna stay home tonight since he&#39;s leaving in only a few months.&amp;nbsp; The difference is an intellectual understanding versus the visceral comprehension that you feel in your gut.&amp;nbsp; With the knowledge that your child wants to spend time with the friends but is still leaving the roost soon, how do you balance out the competing interests so that the kid gets to do what she wants while you still get to spend some meaningful time before that final departure?
Most teens are at the height of egocentrism.&amp;nbsp; While they can participate in all manner of group activities and volunteer heavily, their world still revolves around themselves and there&#39;s an understanding that when they leave high school, that world is going to change dramatically.&amp;nbsp; These bonds and friendships that have formed over the socially intense teen years will forever change as they go off to college, join the armed forces or &#45; hopefully &#45; get a job.&amp;nbsp; Couple that with their passion and sense of invulnerability&amp;nbsp;and the world&#39;s their oyster.&amp;nbsp; Until this passage into the birth of legal adulthood, they&amp;nbsp;will want to play.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Friend time&amp;nbsp;versus family time is a question with which we wrestle here.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Different parents will have different takes and levels of acceptance and my own varies as&amp;nbsp;well.&amp;nbsp; But when your&amp;nbsp;high school senior comes to ask whether she can spend&amp;nbsp;half of the day tomorrow with some buddies, what might you consider?

    Are there actually any family activities planned?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She is still a member of the family and there are still others living within it, others who appreciate her presence at concerts, shows or games.&amp;nbsp; While she might look upon it as a journey into Dante&#39;s Purgatory, spending time can help remind her that there are others who still enjoy her presence.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, these can help reinforce that there are certain family values that are likely not going to be emulated amongst her peers.
    What else is going on within the schedule?&amp;nbsp; Many teens are still getting a handle on time management and if they&#39;re not used to keeping a calendar, then they&#39;re liable to be missing something; even if I don&#39;t know exactly what her schedule is, I can still ask her what&#39;s happening with things like school subjects, work, status of chores and tasks to prompt her memory.&amp;nbsp;
    How often has she been around recently?&amp;nbsp; If she&#39;s not been to a family meal in a period of time, then it&#39;s reasonable to expect her presence to check in on things with her parents and siblings.&amp;nbsp;
    If there are younger siblings, do they seem to miss her?&amp;nbsp;
    Likewise, what standards do you think are being set for the younger siblings as they age?&amp;nbsp; If they perceive that the elder sibling is constantly gone, they&#39;re going to expect the same treatment.&amp;nbsp; The problem with the younger one is that they&#39;ll expect it at a younger age since they don&#39;t have a great grasp on time.&amp;nbsp; Senior sibling is going to a local concert and not&amp;nbsp;home until 11 PM?&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll remember the concert and curfew time, but they won&#39;t recall that she was a senior at that time.
    Naturally, what are the details &#45; who, what, when, where, how &#45; and what&#39;s the track record?&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s still a minor and if something goes wrong, you&#39;ll get the phone call, so you can certainly put the kabosh on something even if it&#39;s going to be unpleasant in the household for awhile.
    It&#39;s not selfish to say no if there&#39;s something that you&#39;d like to do with her.&amp;nbsp; If she&#39;s simply going to be stuck in the house while you do whatever you do with no attention paid to her, then you might as well let her go.&amp;nbsp; But if there&#39;s something that you&#39;d like to do, then you&#39;ve got a right to&amp;nbsp;your time with her

There are no simple answers and what one father finds acceptable might be another&#39;s anathema.&amp;nbsp; Parenting teens is sometimes an inexact science, but it&#39;s helpful to have a sense of what some of the considerations are when she&#39;s standing next to your chair with phone in hand and a question on her lips.</body>

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s College Financing:&nbsp; Taking a bite out of the elephant</title>
<body>How do you eat an elephant?&amp;nbsp; One bite at a time.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Friends with a child who&#39;s a HS senior
Senior year is supposed to be the piece de resistance for high school students.&amp;nbsp; In January, the principal at Eldest&#39;s high school actually had a class meeting with the seniors to warn them that they still had obligations and shouldn&#39;t fall prey to senioritis.&amp;nbsp; For parents with kids facing higher education, there&#39;s a definite pressure as the post high school search ensues and plans have to be made for what happens afterwards.
In our household, the pressure is off slightly as Eldest has finally come to a decision on college.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no more questioning and waiting, tapping both literal and figurative toes as her internal gears grind to a conclusion.&amp;nbsp; But that relief lasted only a short time as the reality of the financing comes into play.&amp;nbsp; The captioned quote was made by a friend that I encountered as I passed through a coffee shop; she and her husband were sitting and commiserating after finishing their taxes.&amp;nbsp; The next step for them, as for us, is the completion and submission of the dreaded FAFSA.&amp;nbsp; Even though I haven&#39;t looked at it yet &#45; that occurs this weekend &#45; the form&#39;s notoriety is such that it&amp;nbsp;inspires a palpable dread and desire for a stiff two&#45;finger shot.&amp;nbsp; Once that&#39;s done, then comes the response from the college with the details of what&#39;s offered.&amp;nbsp;
The institution&#39;s response to the financial data is also something that should be interesting.&amp;nbsp; One of President Obama&#39;s higher education reform policies pertains to an effort to simplify and standardize the college financing letters&amp;nbsp;as well as somehow establish a lid on college costs.&amp;nbsp; The rip on the institutions, particularly the for&#45;profits such as Phoenix, is that their information is convoluted enough that the average student and parent finds it difficult to decipher accurately.&amp;nbsp; While I don&#39;t expect an issue from this particular college, the first gander should be an interesting one.
So my friends and I will have similar days.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll bedeck ourselves with ink&#45;proof bibs and like a diner facing an elephantine dish, start eating it just one bite at a time.&amp;nbsp; I guarantee that I&#39;ll have indigestion afterwards, too.</body>

<title>The Take-away on Greece</title>
<body>Regardless of what happens with Greece, whether they come to an agreement with the Troika or not, here are some things that I&#39;ve taken away from watching it.
This is what society will look like when the bills finally come due and money that&#39;s needed goes instead to the lender.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s only so much wealth circulating in a society and when critical mass is reached, that wealth will have to go to pay off the lender.&amp;nbsp; Crucial services will be unmet and the social net will suffer as that wealth is diverted to repayment.&amp;nbsp; As it stands in Greece, pharmacists are having difficulty getting medications filled for people since the government ministry doesn&#39;t have the money to pay suppliers.&amp;nbsp; People on pensions are looking at cutbacks of more than a third.&amp;nbsp; Families with no income are beginning to consider giving children up for adoption or simply leaving them with the village churches. With almost one half of all Americans living in a household receiving some form of government aid, any cutbacks in domestic assistance are going to have outsize effects upon our families.&amp;nbsp;
Family will matter greatly, moreso than is the American case now.
One of the conversations that we had was with a driver who was taking us from Athens International to our hotel.&amp;nbsp; About half of the Greek population lives in the vicinity of Athens, which grew tremendously in the past three decades.&amp;nbsp; What he&#39;s witnessing however, is that more and more are leaving Athens and returning to the villages in which their families reside.&amp;nbsp; There, they&#39;ll find support from their families and weather what&#39;s about to come with the hope that eventually, they&#39;ll be able to return to a semblance of prosperity afterwards.&amp;nbsp; The point is, they have family with which they can shelter the hardship; the geographically extended and transient nature of the American family today makes that possibility dicier than would occur in a stationary, family&#45;centric society like Greece.&amp;nbsp; If things really go to hell, do you have family upon whom you can fall back?&amp;nbsp; Likewise, how far does your own net extend?
He who pays the piper, calls the tune.
Some members of the German government are openly stating that Greece&#39;s intransigence/incompetence/stalling requires that the European government take over the Greek government&#39;s budgeting and spending authority.&amp;nbsp; This is frankly a financial coup d&#39;etat and brings home the point that whoever controls the finances ultimately drives the process.&amp;nbsp; In a recent post on Greece, I equated this threat to a situation in which we&#39;d see the Chinese, who hold large amounts of our bonds, come in and demand control of our spending process in return for their capital.&amp;nbsp; However, this wouldn&#39;t be a realistic alternative since the Chinese are neither the principal buyers nor holders of our bonds anymore; last year, the Federal Reserve System of the United States&amp;nbsp;became the top non&#45;governmental holder of the federal public debt in the world, at $1.65 Trillion.&amp;nbsp; So a private banking entity &#45; which is what the Federal Reserve actually is &#45; is now the top holder of US debt with 46% more holdings than the second place Chinese and with the Chinese cutting back, it will only grow further.
Understand first that the Federal Reserve System in not part of the Federal government, but instead is a private entity owned by the various member banks; as part of the charter granted by the federal government in 1913, it is owned by the member banks but the leadership is confirmed by government, hence the periodic news that one person or another has been confirmed as Fed chairman by Congress after nomination by the President.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, it is a private entity.&amp;nbsp; That scenario worked for decades, but with the repeal of Glass&#45;Steagal and the unregulated growth of derivatives, it&#39;s become apparent that the Federal Reserve now serves the interests of the banking system first and foremost.&amp;nbsp; Now that you understand this, consider the banker/financier excesses of the past years and ask yourself if the holders of the debt are going to be willing to sacrifice for the common good or if they&#39;ll look to their own interests first.
He who&amp;nbsp;pays the piper, calls the&amp;nbsp;tune.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Greece</title>
<body>Two of the better recent chickflicks of the past several years &#45; Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and Mamma Mia &#45; occur in Greece.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;After viewing the former with her girlfriends one evening several years ago, Eldest came into the kitchen and announced that she would love to go to Greece.&amp;nbsp; My wife, loving travel herself and envisioning the Holy Grail of family vacations, mentally went Boo&#45;Yah! and plans were laid.&amp;nbsp; The trip coincided with the summer of Eldest&#39;s upcoming senior year; after college started, all bets would be off as to future availability for a trip with the entire family.&amp;nbsp; After more than two years of saving, we hit the road to Greece and Italy.&amp;nbsp;
The trip was instructive in a real world sense, as well.&amp;nbsp; Along with the Acropolis and other historic sites, the kids got to experience (peaceful) political protests, riot&#45;damaged buildings and the presence of riot police, armed with automatic weapons; it wasn&#39;t what I envisioned originally, but hey, it&#39;s educational nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, what happens in Greece has&amp;nbsp;a more&#45;than&#45;intellectual interest to our family.&amp;nbsp; As we&#39;ve talked about it periodically, including today&#39;s conversation about the impact of any potential return to the Drachma, it&#39;s been important to keep the players and events straight.&amp;nbsp; So where do we stand at the moment?
As of today, the Greek government is having to decide whether to accept the demands of the &amp;quot;Troika&amp;quot; for continued and additional austerity measures, including the abolition a paid national holiday and reduction in pensions to the tune of about 35%.&amp;nbsp; If they don&#39;t, then the Troika &#45; the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission (the governing body of the European Union) &#45; will refuse to release the 130 Billion Euros to the Greek government that it needs to survive.&amp;nbsp; And what happens if they don&#39;t get the money, among other things?&amp;nbsp; At stake is the next installment of 14.5 billion Euros that the Greeks owe on their outstanding debt; they don&#39;t pay it &#45; and without that money, they can&#39;t &#45; and they&#39;re officially in default.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s have some perspective here since we&#39;re used to dealing in dollars.&amp;nbsp; As of 2010, the Greek GDP was about $304 Billion; at the June 2010 exchange rate of .819 Euros to the Dollar, this means that the Greek GDP was about 249 Billion Euros.&amp;nbsp; This 130 Billion Euro payment that the Greeks need to survive amounts to 52% of their 2010 GDP and if this were occurring here in the US, a proportional amount that we&#39;d need would be in the order of $7.3 Trillion (yes, that&#39;s trillion).
Why are the Greeks balking?&amp;nbsp; First, their government is chronically incapable of collecting taxes since tax evasion is as big a national sport as soccer with a resulting chronic shortfall in revenue.&amp;nbsp; Second, the Greeks are unwilling to part with their social welfare/retirement benefits, which are amongst the most generous in the world.&amp;nbsp; This particularly galls the thrifty Germans, who have a retirement age about a decade later than the average Greek and who see their best and brightest go into Manufacturing, while the best and brightest of the Greeks become tax accountants.&amp;nbsp; Third, some Greeks believe that something is owed to them by the Germans, who&#39;ve never actually apologized &#45; ummm, yeah, about that 1940 invasion and famine...sorry, ok?&amp;nbsp; Now pay up, you sheepherding deadbeats &#45; let alone reimbursed them for all of the damage caused during the Second World War.&amp;nbsp; Fourth &#45; and probably the most important point &#45; is that there&#39;s an amount of gamesmanship occurring.&amp;nbsp; The old saying is that if you owe the bank $100 and can&#39;t pay, you have a problem but if you owe them $1 Million and can&#39;t pay, then the bank has a problem and that&#39;s the issue here.&amp;nbsp; Greek bonds are held by European banks to a large extent and any default or significant &amp;quot;haircut&amp;quot; of the bond values will leave them insolvent and these banks are already suffering from too little capital.&amp;nbsp; Greeks believe that if they stall long enough, they can drive a hard enough bargain to minimize the damage that they know is going to occur.
The final reason that the balk has become almost concrete is that the Germans &#45; who as one of the few financially AAA rated countries in Europe &#45; are the real backstop behind the European bailout.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ve seen this continue for more than a year and are at the point that some of their Ministers are demanding that if the Greeks really want the money, then they&#39;d have to give up control of their public budget and spending functions to non&#45;Greek Europeans; the Greeks would essentially be giving up their sovereignty.&amp;nbsp; Consider the backlash here if we were so in hock that the Chinese demanded control of our fiscal autonomy in return for funds.
The situation is simply so impossible that if it were presented to Solomon, he&#39;d sit down with a fifth of Jack Daniels and call it a night.
So if things are that screwed up, why are they worried about Greece?&amp;nbsp; Again, it comes down to the banks.&amp;nbsp; The European banks are badly undercapitalized and any truly significant hit on their Greek bonds could be devastating to them, let alone to their ability to continue making sufficient loans to actually healthy businesses that need money.&amp;nbsp; These banks are tied up amongst one another in a web effect and the great fear is of a financial lock&#45;up that would make the 2008 Lehman collapse look like a cakewalk.&amp;nbsp; The web effect even carries over to domestic American banks and there&#39;s fear of difficulty here, even if not to the extent of Europe.&amp;nbsp; And once Greece goes, next up is Portugal with its own issues and then Spain and finally, Italy.&amp;nbsp;
The final point is that after actually being there, and talking to the merchants and history guides, the fishing captains and average folks &#45; and yeah, even the riot police were pleasant &#45; this is not simply an intellectual exercise.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a devastating occurrence with real&#45;world consequences that are tragic and instructive if you&#39;re willing to pay attention.&amp;nbsp;
So, which do you choose?&amp;nbsp; Painful austerity and loss of sovereignty, or economic collapse and your nation?</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; February Retail Grocery Basket Cost Declines</title>
<body>PracticalDad&#39;s 47 item retail grocery basket actually declined in cost when priced for February, from an average of $189.91 in January, 2012 to $187.14; the index (November 2010 = 100) now sits at 104.90 and is down from January&#39;s 106.46.&amp;nbsp; The three month moving average is likewise down from it&#39;s January peak of 106.17 to 105.95.
There are some comments that go along with this data.

    There is a bias in dealing with a small survey (47 items priced in three stores) in that issues with particular items within particular stores can skew the results.&amp;nbsp; In this case, two separate grocers have had outsized price increases in two separate items (one per each store) over the past several months and since January, these two items have dropped in cost.&amp;nbsp; The result is that there&#39;s a disproportionate change to the downside as well.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s possible that these two items might be indicative of a larger issue within the grocery supply chain, but it&#39;s impossible to know.
    Despite these two items, February is the first month since the November 2010 index inception in which there are more items dropping in price than increasing (12 decreases versus 10 increases).
    One of the items (spaghetti sauce) dropped in price as one grocer decreased both the item size&amp;nbsp;and the cost, even adjusting upwards back to the original size of 26 ounces.&amp;nbsp; This however, does give greater latitude with potential price increases for that item&amp;nbsp;moving forward.

<title>Vocation or Avocation?&nbsp; Parents and Advising on College</title>
<body>Sage career advice to teens and young adults is to find a way to do what you love.&amp;nbsp; But what if what they love won&#39;t allow them to support themselves, let alone a family?&amp;nbsp; What kind of conversation should the parents be having with the kids as they consider adult careers?
There was once a time when the child&#39;s vocational choices were established by the parents.&amp;nbsp; College was for the wealthy and consisted of classes in dead languages and Natural Philosophy, while those in the mercantile class sent their boys off to apprenticeships; daughters were simply married off with the expectation of raising a family and the only hope for them was that the husband was a good provider.&amp;nbsp; If a child truly loved a particular interest, then they would pursue it as an avocation on their own time after they&#39;d provided a roof and food for themselves.&amp;nbsp; Avocations were chosen by the kids, but the vocations were selected by the parents.&amp;nbsp;
The pendulum has swung back to the other side and many kids over the past several decades have gone into college for both satisfaction and career.&amp;nbsp; That was fine in the old, more affordable, model but we&#39;ve run into two major issues in the past ten or so years.&amp;nbsp; First, the cost is far too great to permit the vast majority to study for the sake of intellectual satisfaction since the career path for English Lit majors is exceptionally short and rocky.&amp;nbsp; Second, the hollowing out and zombification of our economy means that even kids coming out with career aspirations are finding that there are simply no positions available.&amp;nbsp; We now have baristas and convenience store clerks with Master degrees for lack of anything else.
With a kid on the cusp of college and two more in the queue, the questions are how directive should I be and precisely what do I say?&amp;nbsp; As full disclosure, I took my own father&#39;s strongly suggested advice&amp;nbsp;that I earn a Business degree instead of Journalism for the sake of employability and decades later, I&#39;m writing a website while raising kids and managing a household.&amp;nbsp; One of the lessons is that you can never know what&#39;s coming down the road.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a ticklish situation since these kids are passing to adulthood with little experience and a potential mortgage before they even hit the workforce, yet choosing the route of one&#39;s life is the hallmark of adulthood.&amp;nbsp; If we&#39;ve raised them to stand on their own and be accountable for the decisions and consequences, then it&#39;s a blow to the ego to suddenly deprive them of their decision and that&#39;s especially given that many kids are coming through with the bills in their own names.&amp;nbsp; Here are some of the things that we&#39;ve either discussed or tried to do in the past several years.

    Talk openly about the non&#45;dischargeable nature of college debt and the need to be able to select a route that at least gives the possibility of an income that covers the debt load.&amp;nbsp;
    Talk openly about the market for certain occupations and whether the average income allows the graduate to cover the nut.&amp;nbsp; When Eldest did an online career assessment survey through her school, I walked through some of the occupations that spit out in response to her questionaire answers and touched base on whether there&#39;s a bit market for such positions as casting director.
    Talk openly about the college marketing circus so that they understand that they don&#39;t have to attend MIT, Caltech or Swarthmore to obtain a good education.&amp;nbsp;
    Spend some time looking at the incomes for that occupation and share it with the teen.&amp;nbsp; One of the kids, who has a talent and drive for the theatre, has already had the concept of income streams introduced and in a later conversation about music, stated that he was seriously working with his guitar so that he could have a fallback income stream when the theatre gigs were light.&amp;nbsp; *Ding*Ding*Ding!
    Share the status of their college savings with them, if any.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, actually walk through what would be required for debt repayment so that they can compare that with the average income and work through a mock budget.&amp;nbsp; If they take on $X debt, what will they be giving up for the foreseeable future after graduation?

The long and short is that it&#39;s going to be their decision and they&#39;re now &#45; or will soon be &#45; adults.&amp;nbsp; But most of them aren&#39;t stupid and if you&#39;re willing to take the time to engage them, they&#39;ll listen.&amp;nbsp; At the minimum, there&#39;ll at least be a semblance of an educated decision and that&#39;s more information than they&#39;ll get anywhere else.

<title>Comments on Becoming an Adult Male Volunteer</title>
<body>The past four decades have been an almost perfect storm for the adult male role model.
Divorce has wreaked havoc upon the American father as families were broken and in many cases, the father was significantly &#45; if not altogether &#45; removed.&amp;nbsp; Simultaneously, two organizations that could provide alternative&amp;nbsp;solid male role models &#45; the Boy Scouts and the Catholic Church &#45; were beset by problems with pedophiles who preyed upon the now at&#45;risk children.&amp;nbsp; Within the span of about two decades, the sense of trust that had previously permeated middle&#45;class America was shattered as male positions that had been respected were viewed with derision and mistrust.
In the ensuing years, litigation has been filed and settled and perpetrators have been locked away.&amp;nbsp; The Scouts especially have taken child safety to heart and instituted criminal background checks of all volunteers with direct child/youth access, coupled with a serious effort to assure that the outrages of the 1960s and 1970s don&#39;t reoccur.&amp;nbsp; Although I&#39;m not Catholic, my understanding is that there have been measures taken by the Church as well.&amp;nbsp; Despite efforts to both improve the recruitment and training&amp;nbsp;of volunteers, we now have the allegations about Jerry Sandusky to throw a dent into efforts.&amp;nbsp; Apart from the entire Penn State administrative debacle, there are concerns and allegations that Sandusky used the The Second Mile Foundation, founded to help at&#45;risk youth, as a personal game preserve during his involvement there.&amp;nbsp; The effect will be an even greater effort to prevent these situations from recurring and, perhaps, another big hit on the adult male role model as childless men who are willing to volunteer steer clear for fear of automatic suspicion.&amp;nbsp; If this occurs, then about the only group of men who aren&#39;t under&amp;nbsp;automatic suspicion&amp;nbsp;will be those of us with skin in the game, our kids.
Children want and need men, and the positive models that they provide, in their lives.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the activities that benefit our kids don&#39;t run themselves and need our involvement to function and thrive.&amp;nbsp;
So if you&#39;re thinking of becoming a volunteer, what are some points to consider?

    Does the organization have any requirements or guidelines on child safety?&amp;nbsp; Most established organizations, such as the Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts and Big Brothers/Sisters, have established criteria for volunteering and guidelines for interactions with the kids.&amp;nbsp; While I personally dislike having to submit to a criminal background check, it&#39;s simply the cost of doing business in today&#39;s society and ultimately serves to help protect both me and the kids.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d frankly feel less inclined to volunteer with any group that didn&#39;t have a vetting process and safety guidelines for fear of setting myself at risk.
    Are there other volunteers or are you carrying the load?&amp;nbsp; Apart from the sheer equity of having others pitch in, are you going to be the only person who&#39;s actually dealing with the kids?&amp;nbsp; More than a few parents will dump their kids and run and if you&#39;re the only adult present, then you are at risk for any sort of allegations.&amp;nbsp; The true heart of a child&#45;safety policy is the idea of &amp;quot;two&#45;deep&amp;quot; leadership, meaning that there&#39;s simply another adult present, and I&#39;ve been fortunate to have parents and co&#45;leaders who&#39;ve been willing to stay behind with me and other kids whose parents are late to pick them up.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve actually cancelled meetings when the two&#45;deep rule has fallen through.
    Are you prepared to control&amp;nbsp;your speech?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been described as &amp;quot;earthy&amp;quot; in my speech and I&#39;ve had to make a conscious effort to monitor and control it.&amp;nbsp; Like the language, I&#39;ve had to learn to monitor the content.&amp;nbsp; If you tend to run at the mouth or aren&#39;t willing to exercise restraint, then you need to find another outlet.
    Are you prepared to control your physical conduct and mannerisms?&amp;nbsp; Some men are naturally more affectionate than others or more physical in their displays of emotions.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re affectionate with your kids, understand that you have to curtail yourself with other children and especially in today&#39;s environment.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fine to hug an upset child in the presence of other adults,&amp;nbsp; but you have to be conscious of physically displaying affection with other people&#39;s kids lest things be misconstrued.
    Are you aware enough to sense when&amp;nbsp;a conversation or situation is about&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;go out of control?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Do you think that you can manage to handle it&amp;nbsp;if does?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Couple spontaneity with poor self&#45;control you&#39;ve got the makings of a decent trainwreck.&amp;nbsp; Can you sense when things are about to go wrong and can you also sense when to bring it to the attention of the parents?&amp;nbsp; On more than one occasion, I&#39;ve had to being situations under control and since it might involve a raised voice, I&#39;ve&amp;nbsp;let the parents know what occurred and what was said.&amp;nbsp; It lets the parents know up front so that they can address things, and gets the facts out instead of the typically garbled walk&#45;about story that kids and teens provide.&amp;nbsp;
    Are you better with different age groups or different genders?&amp;nbsp; Not all age groups are created equal and you need to consider the age level of the kids within that group.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, do you relate better to girls or to boys?&amp;nbsp; Except for coaching a sport, there are more opportunities for men to interact with boys and male teens than for girls.&amp;nbsp; The Girl Scouts have strict criteria for the interaction of men and girls and even if you do well with those criteria, will the other parents be comfortable with a male Girl Scout leader?&amp;nbsp; I was asked years ago to lead my daughter&#39;s troop and when I discussed it with some female acquaintances, their comment was that they&#39;d be comfortable with me as their daughters&#39; leader, but they&#39;d be very wary of a man that they didn&#39;t know.&amp;nbsp; I declined to participate and found some involvement with my daughter via soccer and basketball.

The need is there and even with the increasing attention, the rewards outweigh the cost.&amp;nbsp; But before you decide to throw your hat into the ring, take some time to consider&amp;nbsp;these points&amp;nbsp;so that your decision is the best for you, the kids and the organizations.

<title>Lessons from the Sandusky Allegations</title>
<body>One of my primary jobs as a father to teach my kids, especially about what goes on in the outside world.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s often fun but can be occasionally unnerving, especially when it pertains to protecting your children from sexual predators; you don&#39;t want to ruin their innocence nor do you want to teach that each stranger is a danger.&amp;nbsp; Teaching about the prospect of sexual molestation is something that we&#39;ve done, with age appropriate language, since the kids were in preschool but the questions have arisen again since the onset of&amp;nbsp;the Sandusky allegations out of Penn State.&amp;nbsp; Understand that if the kids aren&#39;t overtly listening to the news, something of this nature seeps over into their conversations with their own peers via over sources.
What surprised me from my own children was a question raised by Youngest, who looked at me one evening and asked, why didn&#39;t any of these kids ever say anything?&amp;nbsp; My response was that there were probably multiple reasons:

    A sense of powerlessness, as these were boys from predominantly broken homes while the adult in question was a widely respected member of the community with many accomplishments and in their minds, who would believe them?
    A sense, perhaps fostered by coming from a home in which there was minimal presence of a father, that they were unworthy of unconditional love and would have to somehow earn that love and attention from a man.
    Fear of what might happen to them if they did say anything.
    Shame that they somehow contributed to what occurred to them and that discovery might damage whatever love they already did receive, principally from their mothers.

These would lead to some of the points that can be covered as you talk with your kids.

    You&#39;ll certainly ask many questions if this kind of situation is brought forward, but asking for information doesn&#39;t mean automatic disbelief; they simply mean that you&#39;re searching for more information in order to help you help them.
    You love them simply because they&#39;re your children and that your love is unconditional, never depending on their actions or attitudes.
    Reassure them that if they do find themselves being threatened in such a situation, you can and will&amp;nbsp;protect them.&amp;nbsp; This is something that a strong&amp;nbsp;father can do&amp;nbsp;better&amp;nbsp;than most&amp;nbsp;mothers.

Another lesson to take away is finding out about the organization itself and whether it has guidelines on adult volunteer/child&#45;teen&amp;nbsp;interactions.&amp;nbsp; If there are,&amp;nbsp;are there repeated circumstances in which an adult volunteer is violating the guidelines?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve been an active&amp;nbsp;cub scout leader for almost a decade and there are stringent child safety criteria in place; these include&amp;nbsp;requirements for all badges that parents review the scout manual child safety booklet with their children, a&amp;nbsp;criminal background check&amp;nbsp;and use of the &amp;quot;two deep&amp;quot; rule in which no scout leader can have&amp;nbsp;private one&#45;on&#45;one interactions&amp;nbsp;with any child.&amp;nbsp; In the past years, I have actually cancelled meetings&amp;nbsp;when I&#39;ve found that no other&amp;nbsp;adult could be present.&amp;nbsp; The point is that&amp;nbsp;once&amp;nbsp;you&#39;re aware of the criteria, you can keep&amp;nbsp;a better eye on&amp;nbsp;the circumstances in which your child is involved.
A final lesson is this.&amp;nbsp; While having a father present doesn&#39;t mean that your child won&#39;t be molested, the reality is that predators actively search for and target children from broken or strained families.&amp;nbsp; Children, whether very young or teens, want and need your love and support and if they perceive that it&#39;s not there, will seek it out and it&#39;s this search that can bring them into the sights of predators.

<title>Controlling Your Kids</title>
<body>One of a parent&#39;s responsibilities is to control their child and nothing is more frustrating than a parent who can&#39;t or won&#39;t control their child in public.&amp;nbsp; When should&amp;nbsp;you&amp;nbsp;step in and provide control&amp;nbsp;if the other parent won&#39;t?
This question arose recently at a scouting event in which boys &#45; fourth and fifth grade levels &#45; were gathered at a&amp;nbsp;science museum to earn an Engineering badge.&amp;nbsp; This was a four and&amp;nbsp;a half hour workshop run by a museum staffer, for which admission was charged.&amp;nbsp; Parents were present and while I&#39;m a scout leader that arranged for the boys in my group to attend, I wasn&#39;t present because of another obligation.&amp;nbsp; According to other parents to whom I spoke, there was a particular boy from another group who simply ran wild and disrupted things; even the other boys from my group were appalled at his behavior.&amp;nbsp; He ruined experiments and talked back to the staffer and in one experiment involving electricity, actually injured one of the boys from my scout pack, who showed several of us the mark on his stomach at a scout meeting four days later.&amp;nbsp; A father who was present backed up the accounts and the event involving the electricity.
On one level, the museum bears responsibility because the staffer didn&#39;t act to control the child when he was found to be openly disruptive.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that this is a staffer who&#39;s paid to present a program and not discipline children who are there with responsible adults, either parents or scout leaders.&amp;nbsp; The boy&#39;s father was present and at no time stepped in, but simply sat back and watched his child misbehave and openly create problems.&amp;nbsp; No other adult stepped in either, apparently for fear of appearing to overstep boundaries and upsetting the father and the result was that when I met with the boys several nights later and asked about the event, what I heard was a story about a trainwreck instead of electrical circuits and bridgebuilding.&amp;nbsp; This was confirmed by the parents who were present with our boys.
It&#39;s an unpleasant and uncomfortable situation, fraught with the prospect of further conflict if the other parent is an ass who won&#39;t like seeing Junior chastised.&amp;nbsp; But when should you step in?

    When you believe that the other parent will simply not intercede AND there&#39;s real prospect of injury should something go wrong, like children throwing rocks at kids who are coming down the sliding board.
    When it&#39;s an event for which you&#39;ve paid money and a lack of control threatens to ruin it for your child and other children.
    When it&#39;s not only misbehavior, but open bullying of your child and the other parent will not intercede.

&amp;nbsp;In the last instance, it might take a little time to see how your own child handles things.&amp;nbsp; Years ago, when Youngest was not quite three, we were at a mall play area when he encountered a child who by size and appearance was several years older.&amp;nbsp; This child would purposefully run into Youngest and knock him down, then return to his mother, who was also clearly watching events.&amp;nbsp; Youngest was knocked down twice and purposefully shoved down once and in the middle of this, she and I exchanged looks as things unfolded.&amp;nbsp; When the last shove occurred, I moved to intercede but stopped as&amp;nbsp;Youngest got up, walked over and punched the bigger kid in the face.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, Youngest proceeded to play while the other boy&amp;nbsp;then&amp;nbsp;left with his mother.&amp;nbsp;
Each of us has a responsibility to monitor and control our children.&amp;nbsp; It can be embarrassing to have to do so in public, but that&#39;s one of the prices paid for having kids in the first place.&amp;nbsp; Each of us likewise has an obligation to step up when we see a child&#39;s misbehavior being willfully ignored by the idiot parent, and I say that because if you don&#39;t, that&#39;s how you look to the rest of us.</body>

<title>Unpleasantries:&nbsp; Discipline and Teens</title>
<body>One of the most difficult aspects&amp;nbsp;of raising a child is&amp;nbsp;discipline, at whatever age.&amp;nbsp; That said, disciplining the child becomes even harder as she ages and in the teen years, it can become a damned unpleasant thing for which&amp;nbsp; parents&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;unprepared.&amp;nbsp; Teens are affected by their peers &#45; some of whom have little or no parental discipline &#45; and frankly, the media.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re affected by their own bodies, which are producing a complex and potent hormonal chemistry regardless of gender and they&#39;re affected by their own sense of growing independence and competence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;re&amp;nbsp;almost three&amp;nbsp;generations removed from the bestselling&amp;nbsp;parent books&amp;nbsp;of Dr. Benjamin Spock, who was mistakenly believed to have taught that it wasn&#39;t in the child&#39;s best interests to be disciplined, discipline being equated with punishment.&amp;nbsp; Parenting experts say that we should be firm and in control with the intimation that voices should never be raised and that if we handle it correctly, then the teen will desist and all will be well.&amp;nbsp; And somehow, the belief has seeped in that we should be our childrens&#39; friend first and foremost and friends simply don&#39;t treat one another in a nasty way.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The final result is, I believe, that there are many parents who will defer to the teen who pushes the limits and boundaries in the belief that what&#39;s required to keep them within them is not&amp;nbsp;acceptable as portrayed in the popular media.&amp;nbsp; And the inmates wind up running the asylum.
Discipline is ultimately rooted in the notion of teaching and learning, which is a far cry from simple punishment.&amp;nbsp; If you have just a quick, quiet conversation to point something out to them, you&#39;re actually engaging in discipline and it&#39;s frequently enough to keep things in order.&amp;nbsp; The difficulty is that as they age, all of the factors already mentioned come into play and make correction more difficult; if you haven&#39;t already been quietly covering things with them, then it&#39;s going to appear even more onerous than it would otherwise.&amp;nbsp;
Even if you&#39;ve paid attention and had the ongoing conversations through all of the previous years, handling discipline with teens will become testy for all of the reasons proffered above.&amp;nbsp; While the teens are motivated by whatever they want &#45; most likely short&#45;term or short&#45;sighted &#45; you&#39;re the one with the sense of the larger picture and that&#39;s fine except that the pressing teen doesn&#39;t see it that way.&amp;nbsp; There will be pushback and questions and even when the questions are answered, the rationale will be challenged and it can happen persistently.&amp;nbsp; Because the kids are now older, any number of issues will be thrown at you in sometimes forcible short order and in the moment, you have to determine the wheat from the chaff and move accordingly, all the while keeping the end goal in mind.&amp;nbsp; You have, in a sense, been ushered by your teens into Hogwarts, where the staircases move while you try to&amp;nbsp;reach where you&amp;nbsp;need to be.&amp;nbsp;
These exchanges&amp;nbsp;aren&#39;t easy as&amp;nbsp;sometimes&amp;nbsp;frustration seeps in amongst both generations and voices are raised against one another.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t a pretty scene and if you&#39;ve consumed the popular parenting media, you&#39;ll feel like a failure because it isn&#39;t as calm, controlled and easy as it is made to appear.&amp;nbsp; When the time is less tense, you can&amp;nbsp;re&#45;evaluate what&#39;s been said and even go back and revisit the issues with your teen; communication is an ongoing process.&amp;nbsp; When these instances occur, it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re a failure as a parent.&amp;nbsp; What it means is that you&#39;re having to grapple with the change that occurs with growing kids and change isn&#39;t easy.&amp;nbsp; What makes a failure is&amp;nbsp;simply taking the easy road, acceding to the demands of frequently irrational teens because it means a few moments of peace.

<title>Plan 9 from the Kitchen</title>
<body>Cell phones can be wonderful tools, but several other parents and I have noted they can be impediments when in the hands of teens.&amp;nbsp; The problem that we&#39;ve all noted is that while the kids can be in almost instantaneous communication with one another to plan something,&amp;nbsp;anyone&#39;s&amp;nbsp;different thought, idea or issue is&amp;nbsp;immediately brought up to the cell&#45;linked hive mind and innumerable alternative plans are spun to the point that ultimately, either nothing occurs or what happens in no way resembles the original plan.&amp;nbsp; Not to say that the &amp;quot;old days&amp;quot; were necessarily better, but with only one line to a house and the pain&#45;in&#45;the&#45;neck nature of plan changes, a plan that was generally agreed upon was maintained.&amp;nbsp;
The term Plan 9 or Plan I came into being in this household when several months ago, I watched Eldest run the gamut in the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; My wife and I were puttering in the kitchen when Eldest entered and announced that she and several friends were going to gather for something or another.&amp;nbsp; Shortly after she entered, her cellphone noted an incoming text and when she read it, she reported that somebody had asked if someone else could come &#45; and naturally, that led to the question of how the newb would be transported and who could do so.&amp;nbsp; As she plunked in a response to the hive&#45;mind, I glanced at my wife and commented that this was going to be&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Plan B.&amp;nbsp; Eldest finished her texting and was in the process of putting down the phone when another came in with someone else tossing out a question, which led to another furious round of texting and a quietly dry Plan C commented to my wife.&amp;nbsp; By now, there was a full&#45;fledged exchange of texts from the hive&#45;mind and my wife and I slowed down to watch the process.&amp;nbsp; I was now standing at the kitchen island nursing a cup of coffee and as Eldest would remark upon the newest response, I&#39;d remark that this was Plan D...wait, now here comes Plan E...whoa, someone else has some input for &#45; wait for it &#45; Plan F...nah, that&#39;s not gonna work so we&#39;re onto Plan G...okay, so it looks like we&#39;re set for Plan H...nope, Plan I.&amp;nbsp; My wife handled it more gracefully than me since I was openly laughing as I&amp;nbsp;remarked upon this trainwreck of a social gathering.&amp;nbsp; Eldest finally harrumphed with a nasty glance in my direction and left the kitchen and to this day, I don&#39;t know if they managed to round the bases to Plan Z.&amp;nbsp;
The upshot of this is that first, Eldest frequently makes her hive&#45;mind plans out of my presence.&amp;nbsp; Second, we&#39;ve learned that there are liable to be changes in the plans between when they&#39;re made and when the car leaves the driveway.&amp;nbsp; Knowing that the hive tries desperately to bend to the needs of the members, changes can occur and our request is that we apprised of significant changes, such as final destination or time of return; we also reserve the right to veto anything that we deem necessary and yes, I&#39;ve kept the prospect of a physical location check on the table.&amp;nbsp;
When a teenager leaves the house with friends, you can never be certain of where they&#39;re actually going to wind up or what the final plan is.&amp;nbsp; Especially with this hive&#45;mind generation, plans seem to change in&amp;nbsp;a heartbeat and you can only lean upon faith and what you&#39;ve taught them as you&#39;ve raised them; that there are such things as respect, limits, consequences and ultimately, right&#45;and&#45;wrong.&amp;nbsp; There can be legitimate changes in plans that entail acceptable deviation and it&#39;s our job as parents to work with that.&amp;nbsp; But ultimately, they need to know that the cellphone connects to home and once that call is made, the constant changes will stop and&amp;nbsp;gel into a firm plan for the remainder of the gathering.</body>

<title>Commercials and Perception</title>
<body>True change only happens incrementally and like anything else, you only notice it at moments when you have an a&#45;ha! moment.&amp;nbsp; For me, one of the primary indicators of changes in the social view is in the content of television commercials and what while most of my time isn&#39;t spent on the television, there have a few commercials which both show considerable change and the potential for generational conflict ahead.
Change Commercials
One of my gripes through the years has been the perception of fathers as portrayed in the media.&amp;nbsp; With only the rare exceptions &#45; Seventh Heaven&#39;s&amp;nbsp; Reverend Camden and Parenthood&#39;s Adam Braverman &#45; fathers have normally been portrayed as lovable dolts (Ray Romano) or complete idiots (Al Bundy, Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin).&amp;nbsp; These are reflections of society&#39;s views of men and fathers from a generation or more touched by divorce and absentee fatherhood.&amp;nbsp; But a recent commercial gave me a pause as its 30 seconds portrayed a reflection of the re&#45;engaging father.&amp;nbsp; In it, two children are preparing to brush their teeth as their father &#45; no mother to correct him or chuckle at his well&#45;meant but errant effort &#45; explains why he purchases a particular brand of dental hygiene product.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s young and dressed &#45; as I frequently dress &#45; in a casual button shirt and khaki slacks.&amp;nbsp; The sense of the commercial is that Dad&#39;s competent and in charge and the kids are alright with that and is a far cry from other commercials in which Mom can be seen correcting Dad for a goof.
The other two change commercials aren&#39;t about fathers per se, but instead about the opposing views of&amp;nbsp;the boomer generation and Generation Y.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been ongoing commentary about the values and behavior of the Boomer generation and the first commercial clearly plays upon that.&amp;nbsp; In the scene, a man is seated at a nicely set dinner table and both he and his wife complain about having been forced to curtail the sushi that they love, yet the woman brings him a small plate of food.&amp;nbsp; At that moment, as he cuts into the dish, their daughter enters and asks if they know what&#39;s happened to her two fish.&amp;nbsp; They each feign ignorance and as the father digs in, quips what are you gonna do?&amp;nbsp;
In the second set of commercials, young adults are in their respective apartments worrying about how their empty&#45;nest parents are doing now that they&#39;re out of the house.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re typically online and the commentary pertains to the vast number of Facebook friends whereas their folks have so few.&amp;nbsp; As the commercial continues, they&#39;re concerned for their folks while the scene flips to a shot of the folks &#45;&amp;nbsp; Boomers &#45; going to a kegger with their friends and another set of Boomer parents gets out to ride horseback.&amp;nbsp; The copywriter is conceivably a Boomer who&#39;s poking fun at the youngsters&#39; apparent belief that life is lived plugged into the Matrix.&amp;nbsp; But what struck me watching it was the contrast between the two generational lifestyles; apart from the real/virtual aspect, was the question of money.&amp;nbsp; While the younger generation is much more into the Matrix than my own peers, I suspect that part of that pastime popularity is that it&#39;s much cheaper than activities as boarding or renting horses as that generation continues to spend money on less than wise choices.
The final change commercial again pertains to the Generation Y adults and money in them, from both State Farm and Toyota, the young twenty&#45;something woman is saving and scrimping to cover either the auto insurance or the down payment for her auto.&amp;nbsp; It differs from years of commercials in which cars were sold with little down and zero percent financing and harks back to a time, generations ago, when necessary items were purchased with hard&#45;saved cash.&amp;nbsp; The clock is spinning backwards in terms of personal finance and we&#39;d better get used to it.
So what do these commercials have to do with me?&amp;nbsp; My sense of them is that first, it&#39;s my responsibility as a parent to recognize the change and work to teach my children accordingly, both through discussion and example.&amp;nbsp; If they have to learn how to live a more constrained lifestyle, it&#39;ll be easier if it&#39;s modeled for them here.&amp;nbsp; Second, change never goes down easily and the anger towards the Boomer generation will only intensify as the youngsters face their national future.&amp;nbsp; While I don&#39;t envision a life of spartan simplicity, I doubt that it&#39;s in my best interests to throw the green years pay away on frivolity to only have to return to the kids in the future for help.&amp;nbsp; Once they&#39;re through, our obligation is to assure &#45; as much as possible &#45; that we don&#39;t unduly burden our children because of our own foolishness.

<title>Housework Minuet</title>
<body>Does&amp;nbsp;your mate ever suddenly leave&amp;nbsp;to disappear, reappearing again in a few minutes with an armload of laundry/stuff/toys?&amp;nbsp; (1&#45;2&#45;3, 1&#45;2&#45;3)&amp;nbsp; Do you ever wonder why your mate gets cranky, occasionally snarling about fair share or even simple appreciation?&amp;nbsp; (1&#45;2&#45;3, 1&#45;2&#45;3)&amp;nbsp; Is there ever a moment in which there&#39;s a sigh as she escapes to respond to a buzzer?&amp;nbsp; (1&#45;2&#45;3, 1&#45;2&#45;3, 1&#45;2&#45;3&#45;4)&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;ve at least noticed these things, you&#39;re ahead of some guys who don&#39;t even recognize that she&#39;s dancing&amp;nbsp;the minuet, a particularly slow and monotonous variety that keeps the rhythm of cooking and housework as everything is done to keep the household moving and everyone on an even keel.
A family is a complex organism and each moves to its own rhythm and tempo &#45; rarely the same and often punctutated by syncopation, especially as the kids age and develop their own interests.&amp;nbsp; The varying tempos means that greater attention must be paid to what&#39;s required to keep everything moving and everyone on an even keel.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t understand if it&#39;s training or some sort of gender hardwiring, but I believe that the average woman is better able to multitask&amp;nbsp;a variety of chores and activities than the guy.&amp;nbsp; Men are certainly able to learn and adapt, but I&#39;ve come to know some&amp;nbsp;women of whom I frankly stand in awe.&amp;nbsp;
There are multiple elements to running the household &#45; cooking, laundry, childrearing, cleaning &#45; and most men would probably view them as discrete items, akin to blocks that can be stacked atop one another.&amp;nbsp; Now the laundry is entirely done and I can move on to the cleaning.&amp;nbsp; Once that is done, then I can read to the kids and afterwards, start dinner.&amp;nbsp; Each item has a finite edge and end and never violates the space of the next block.&amp;nbsp; Women have learned that each element is actually akin to a strip of cloth or thread.&amp;nbsp; Each is discrete but instead of stacking, each element is interwoven with another through the course of the day&#39;s and evening&#39;s activities, resulting in something that appears to have been knit together.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll sort the laundry and get a load of darks going, and then I&#39;ll read to Junior.&amp;nbsp; After a short book, I can move the washer load to the dryer and reload the washer and while that&#39;s running, I&#39;ll take care of early dinner preparation.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a creation of one element followed by another, and then back to the first and then to the third;&amp;nbsp; the result is that the guy&#39;s elements are akin to a colorful Lego tower while the woman&#39;s creation is a well&#45;knit scarf.&amp;nbsp;
The difference between the two is that most men haven&#39;t truly learned that the key to keeping things running is to shift back and forth between the elements, juggling them as deftly as a circus performer.&amp;nbsp; You use a labor&#45;saving device that takes a half&#45;hour to run and then you shift into something that can be accomplished in twenty minutes, such as reading a children&#39;s book or cutting vegetables.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, you fold the laundry and then come back to it later, breaking the larger task into smaller segments.&amp;nbsp; Because they&#39;ve done it for so much longer and been able to watch their own mothers, women have a much better sense of what&#39;s involved and how they interplay.&amp;nbsp; Men can learn it too, but it will take considerable effort, attention and time before they can even begin to create a piece as intricate as their mate&#39;s.&amp;nbsp;
The archetypal father was someone who came home from work and played with the kids, and then did the finite, discrete tasks that were akin to projects &#45; the honeydew list.&amp;nbsp; Fix something, paint something and move on to the next item.&amp;nbsp; There would be singular differences between each which provided some variety and interest.&amp;nbsp; Women have known for generations that even after this was painted or that was fixed, they were left with the same four elements; there was &#45; and is &#45; never an end to the process.&amp;nbsp; The result is a sense of having to dance the same dance, keeping everything moving, with never a difference in the music for variety and worse, no one to watch them or realize how well they dance their particular minuet.&amp;nbsp; Everyone likes an audience from time to time, observing and appreciating them for what they&#39;ve managed to accomplish and for some dancers, this is sufficient.&amp;nbsp; But if you think of it, dancing is something that&#39;s meant to be done with a partner and most women find that the additional dimension of a partner gives meaning to the dance and respite from the boredom.&amp;nbsp;
Stop, observe and think about what you&#39;re seeing if your mate is responsible for the household management.&amp;nbsp; Consider what&#39;s involved and at least acknowledge&amp;nbsp;the job&amp;nbsp;being done.&amp;nbsp; Better yet, find the rhythm and give her a partner in the dance.

<title>The Great Divide</title>
<body>You can understand something intellectually, but that doesn&#39;t mean that you fully grasp the import of its meaning.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this difference that shifts an issue from sterile discussion to true debate, as those who feel it in their gut push the envelope and make their points in ever more forceful tones.&amp;nbsp; This comprehension shift happened to me this past weekend as the ongoing erosion of the American Middle Class took on a far more personal and visceral meaning.
My most important job as a father is to teach my children about the great wide world and help prepare them to survive in it.&amp;nbsp; Doing that means that I also have to pay attention to what&#39;s going on around us and how these things impact the world in which my children will live.&amp;nbsp; The rise of the corporate society and the official preference of the uber&#45;rich at the cost of the middle class has clearly shaped what and how I teach my children about the adult world.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve taught the kids that an education is essential for economic survival and have done what we can to see that it&#39;s obtained with as little debt as possible.&amp;nbsp; But spend a lot of time around kids and teens and you begin to think of many of them as your own; you watch them grow from small children and fill out, physically at first and then in terms of mind, emotion and character.&amp;nbsp; When this happens, you begin to worry about the kids who aren&#39;t being given much guidance and support and it can be painful.
The case in point occurred when I was speaking with Eldest about one of her close, a young man who&#39;s shown significant character and maturity.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d already graduated from high school and was working and our questions &#45; my wife and&amp;nbsp;I &#45; pertained to what was happening with his plans for community college to get the higher ed ball rolling again.&amp;nbsp; As I spoke with my daughter, I reiterated my well&#45;rehearsed commentary on the need for the education but then simply stated if he doesn&#39;t get things moving while he&#39;s young, he&#39;s going to spend his life on the other side of the great divide.&amp;nbsp; It struck me as an odd phrase at the time and when I reflected back on it later, my reaction was far more visceral than it had been previously.
...The Great Divide...
Economic and political policies, as well as long&#45;standing social habits,&amp;nbsp;are eating away at the middle class and if changes aren&#39;t&amp;nbsp; made, future America &#45; our children&#39;s America &#45; will consist of two groups on either side of a chasm.&amp;nbsp; There was once ground which permitted both groups to live together but the existent policies&amp;nbsp;will continue to undermine this until it collapses into an unbridgeable gap.&amp;nbsp; Once this happens, separating the small group on one side from the large group on the other, then there will be nothing to bind them together and our nation will devolve into a state of nightmarish proportions as the larger group struggles to survive and the smaller one fights desperately to maintain its advantage in resources and opportunities.
While I want this young man to succeed, I&#39;m ashamed that my great divide remark was so contained to one person.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve come into contact with so many children and teens and it&#39;s unacceptable that a handful gain the one side while the rest are stranded on the other; each should be responsible as adults for their own movement forward, but permitting the presence of the divide robs the mass of even the opportunity to move.&amp;nbsp; If our Constitution states that each has the right to pursue happiness, the chasm&#39;s existence is inherently unconstitutional as it robs the many of that right.&amp;nbsp; Many will be bound, despite their efforts, to a life without the opportunity to advance themselves beyond their present station and our nation is at a loss for it.
There are no simple, cookie&#45;cutter responses to this erosion and things will change neither easily or quickly.&amp;nbsp; But there are some basic things to remember and adopt.

    Begin to pay attention to what&#39;s going on around you.&amp;nbsp; Question what you read and hear in the main stream media and when you hear a pundit, ask yourself what that person and his or her sponsor has to gain.&amp;nbsp; Then share with your family and friends and spread the word.
    Teach your children not to believe what they hear and see in the media.&amp;nbsp; You cannot have it all and will have to make choices.&amp;nbsp; The newest product model or version won&#39;t make you happy or satisfied.&amp;nbsp; You cannot expect to live on support but will have to hustle to make your way in the world.&amp;nbsp; The old economic model of spend, spend and spend is no longer operative.&amp;nbsp; And yes, you&#39;re going to have to study and above all, think.
    Amend your buying habits so that you don&#39;t automatically purchase the lowest cost item, which will probably be made in China or elsewhere in the world.&amp;nbsp; Think about where an item originates and whether your purchase supports your fellow citizens.
    Likewise, buy local when and where you can.&amp;nbsp; As I age, my buying priorities are becoming local first, domestic second and finally, foreign if necessary.&amp;nbsp; This way, I&#39;m putting my own kids and their peers to work first and supporting their livelihoods.
    Pay greater attention to the electoral process and what the candidates are doing instead of saying.&amp;nbsp; Skepticism is a healthy thing and ask whether they&#39;re consistent in their beliefs; if necessary, turn off the main stream media and shift to the internet.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll have to work harder to skim the wheat from the chaff, but it&#39;s worthwhile.&amp;nbsp;
    Finally, remember that our country has been here before, in the post&#45;Civil War era of the Railroad Tycoons and Robber Barons, when a very few took dominion over our nation&#39;s wealth and resources.&amp;nbsp; Our ancestors dealt with it then and we can deal with it as well.

But remember also that it took the work of many to elect men such as Theodore Roosevelt and his peers.&amp;nbsp; And many, many votes.</body>

<title>Upgrading Dad&#8217;s Hard-Drive</title>
<body>In today&#39;s world, I can&#39;t help but think of computers when I consider the differences between the male and female brains. One of the criticisms of men in family relationships is that &amp;quot;things aren&#39;t what they were&amp;quot; and that&#39;s largely because the hard drive atop a woman&#39;s shoulders is crunching data and work functions almost continuously to the exclusion of the game processes.&amp;nbsp; But even if men are standing up and doing more, there&#39;s an additional difference and that becomes glaringly obvious at Christmas &#45; we&#39;re running completely completely different operating systems at different speeds.&amp;nbsp; Women are at the higher speeds on a Windows 7 while we&#39;re hammering along with XE on a three year old laptop.
I fully believe that men can do as well at raising kids as women, maternal intuition notwithstanding.&amp;nbsp; But I do believe that women are simply better able to multitask than men and especially in the case of details.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In this household, things move along well until late October&amp;nbsp;and then we shift into the seasonal holiday mode in which my wife&#39;s ability to remember the smallest details simply puts me to shame.&amp;nbsp; Youngest is old enough to get a real tie and if we get this, he can wear it with the following outfits...Eldest has a sweater that would go great with this necklace...Let&#39;s face it, I&#39;m the one managing the clothing and laundry and I haven&#39;t the foggiest notion of what they&#39;ve got in terms of colors and style.&amp;nbsp; In case you wonder if I&#39;m just style&#45;impaired, consider the following.
Remember when we got my father that sweater four years ago?&amp;nbsp; Nope.
Would best friend be able to use this purse?&amp;nbsp; Haven&#39;t a clue.
Do you know if Middle needs new dark socks since his feet have grown?&amp;nbsp; Nuh &#45; uh.
The modern Christmas season has become a complex dance with intricate moves along a multi&#45;dimensional dance floor.&amp;nbsp; This is partially due to the influence of the consumer model in which we equate a quality Christmas with the number of gifts given and partially because of the way that the families are now geographically dispersed throughout the country.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s simply more to do and cover for people to have what is considered a good season.&amp;nbsp; The other influence is probably due to the simple difference between men and women; I believe that women are hard&#45;wired to be more empathethic and concerned with the feelings of others than men, so they place a greater emphasis on these details than their mates.
But the reality is that if you hooked up a wife and mother&#39;s brain to a computer diagnostic, you&#39;d probably find more processes running than that of their mate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;suspect that&amp;nbsp;if the men made more of an effort to upgrade their processes, they&#39;d probably find that their mate would correspondingly let the processes slow down.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s still be a qualitative difference however, and I don&#39;t think that that leap is going to be easily made.

<title>Ghosts of Christmas Present</title>
<body>``You have never seen the like of me before!&#39;&#39; exclaimed the Spirit.
``Never,&#39;&#39; Scrooge made answer to it.
``Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers born in these later years?&#39;&#39; pursued the Phantom.
``I don&#39;t think I have,&#39;&#39; said Scrooge. ``I am afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?&#39;&#39;
``More than eighteen hundred,&#39;&#39; said the Ghost.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Scrooge&#39;s Encounter with the Ghost of Christmas Present, Dickens&#39; A Christmas Carol
None of us have walked with all of the previous ghosts, now numbering more than 2000.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When you&#39;re enmeshed&amp;nbsp;in the fabric of life with children, it sometimes seems as though it will always remain the same &#45; Santa Claus pictures, toys and after&#45;bedtimes evenings spent wrapping and hiding.&amp;nbsp; But step back and observe and you find that while the ghosts are very similar,&amp;nbsp;they are subtly different over time until you&amp;nbsp;realize that the being is entirely different; simpler, quieter and more genteel.&amp;nbsp; This is the progression of Christmases as the kids age and move further into the outside world.&amp;nbsp;
As the kids age, they take the commercial idea of a gift&#45;wrapped, shiny Christmas and unknowingly burnish it&amp;nbsp;to a marvelous core that really doesn&#39;t require all of the accompanying bells and whistles.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a core composed of the elements of family and friends and if you believe, faith.&amp;nbsp; Listen to the kids&#39; memories and you find that it usually isn&#39;t the toy that&#39;s remembered from any particular year so much as what happens with the toy afterwards, all of the memories that come from playing with it and frequently, with you.&amp;nbsp; Take a moment to consider each ghost and examine it for what it is,&amp;nbsp;then burn it into your memory alongside each of its siblings.&amp;nbsp; It will make you appreciate what you have all of the more.
May you &#45; and your family &#45; have a wonderful Christmas season.

<title>Keep Talking, Somebody&#8217;s Listening</title>
<body>Most parents can identify the moment when the kids tune out since the eyes glaze over and with a few, the mouth actually drops open.&amp;nbsp; When younger siblings are present however, I continue what I&#39;m saying since I want them to hear what&#39;s being said.&amp;nbsp; In a sense, I&#39;m playing to an audience and there are instances in which it&#39;s apparent that they&#39;re taking the commentary to heart.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>OWS/Tea Party:&nbsp; Two Sides, Same Coin</title>
<body>Think of the faces of OWS and the Tea Party and you have two seemingly very different groups.&amp;nbsp; OWS is young, and if you read the more recent media accounts, slovenly and prone to the goofy, odd behavior exemplified by the younger generation.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, those who identified themselves as Tea Partiers are typically middle&#45;aged or older and notable for their self&#45;control and law&#45;abiding approach.&amp;nbsp; I suspect that if you were to randomly pluck two hundred individuals from each group and ask them to gather in an open area, the OWS group&#39;s outline would resemble a pulsing amoeba while the Tea Partiers would assume a shape with defined corners.&amp;nbsp; As different as they are however, these two groups are akin to a coin.&amp;nbsp; Each side of the coin has a different image and label.&amp;nbsp; But each is minted from the same material so that beneath the disparate images&amp;nbsp;facing in seemingly opposite directions, the core substance is the same.&amp;nbsp; In this matter, the substance is composed of disagreement with, and opposition to, a power structure that is now functionally fascist.
Fascist is a term that&#39;s been bandied around for decades as protestors proclaim one person or another as a fascist, akin to a&amp;nbsp;jackbooted thug who&#39;s happier with a trudgeon than a pen.&amp;nbsp; But fascism is actually a political structure in which the interests of big business &#45; controlled by a small group of individuals &#45; are allied closely with big government, also controlled by a small coterie of people.&amp;nbsp; Each element provides the other with the wherewithal to prosper and that prosperity generally comes at the expense of the large majority of the society.&amp;nbsp; Any democratic nation is predicated upon the notion that the various elements are able to compromise in such a fashion that the setting exists for the majority to prosper.&amp;nbsp; In the fascist state however, the two minorities are so self&#45;absorbed that they wish only to further themselves and the remainder be damned; in the extreme cases, if it takes a jackbooted thug to cow and subdue the remainder for the benefit of the minority, so be it.&amp;nbsp;
America&#39;s present power structure is ostensibly democratic, but the interconnectedness of the corporations and government as shown by their actions is functionally fascist.&amp;nbsp; At the end of his second term, then&#45;President Dwight Eisenhower warned of the potential dangers of what is referred to as the &amp;quot;military/industrial complex&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; His concern was predicated on the idea that the rewards of power and money would corrupt the political system to the benefit of these two groups alone.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve outsourced much of our manufacturing, but the industrial faction has since been joined by the financiers, who&#39;ve demonstrated their willingness to spend huge amounts lobbying to curry the favor and votes needed to build their parasitic fiefdoms.&amp;nbsp; The end result is that corporations, benefitting only a few shareholders and senior executives, retain outsized profits&amp;nbsp;while&amp;nbsp;the control of our currency has been effectively turned over to a private entity that enables and defends the foolish, short&#45;term actions of its banking wards.
Here&#39;s where the two nascent political groups are both alike and differ.&amp;nbsp; Each opposes a separate head of this two&#45;headed creature, Orthrus, which exists in a body that cannot prosper and function outside of its present form.&amp;nbsp; Think of the prototypical Tea&#45;Partier and what comes to mind is a middle&#45;aged middle class causcasian, who is aghast at the out&#45;of&#45;control spending of an intrusive government that exists simply to grow.&amp;nbsp; If the average American reaches some form of political consciousness during their late teens and early twenties, then these folks awoke to Ronald Reagan, who famously stated that government isn&#39;t the solution, it&#39;s the problem.&amp;nbsp; Reagan&#39;s ability to effectively communicate and encapsulate ideas laid the cornerstone of today&#39;s Tea Party and fostered their antipathy to Orthrus&#39; governmental head.&amp;nbsp; OWS is comprised of the Tea&#45;Party&#39;s children, who awakened to find that their hopes for a decent, prosperous future had been outsourced by Orthrus&#39; corporate head.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;d bought into the premise that there were jobs available to help pay off the permanent debt that they accepted for the ticket that gave entrance to the middle&#45;class life.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, if I&#39;d hocked my next decade of earnings for a World Series ticket and found myself watching sandlot ball, I&#39;d be upset, too.&amp;nbsp; But don&#39;t be fooled by the photos of the group members; in the instances in which I&#39;ve gone past the OWS encampment in my local city, the graybeards (and graybeardlesses as well) have been present.
Each of these groups has arisen &#45; regardless of who&#39;s purportedly funding it &#45; because the citizenry is looking around and finding that Orthrus&#39; foes are either broken or co&#45;opted.&amp;nbsp; The unions that arose to challenge the industrial order in the early 20th century are broken, a shadow of their former selves.&amp;nbsp; Even the public unions are on the retreat as the populace wonders why they should continue to receive top&#45;tier benefits while they, the taxpayers, take it in the teeth.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the media that portrays the OWS members as unkempt, lazy kids is principally controlled by a handful of major corporations who are part of the group being protested by OWS.&amp;nbsp; Consider the verbiage coming from FoxNews, controlled by one Rupert Murdoch, whose minions were turned out in England when it was found that they were actually hacking the phones of public figures.&amp;nbsp; Even if this &#45; hopefully &#45; isn&#39;t occurring here, do you believe that similar beyond&#45;the&#45;reach attitudes aren&#39;t occurring here just because we&#39;re across the pond?&amp;nbsp; So why are they separated, despite their similarities?&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re separated because the image is manipulated into the classic left/right standoff, when the reality is that it really is an upper/lower conflict in the offing.&amp;nbsp; When you hear the commentary about the youngsters, ask yourself who&#39;s talking and more importantly, who&#39;s paying the speaker&#39;s salary?
While we&#39;re functionally fascist, this isn&#39;t the first time in our history that we&#39;ve been in this situation and I&#39;m not certain that the jackboots will march down Main Street and Constitution Avenue.&amp;nbsp; But the recent passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, which throws open the prospect of the open&#45;ended confinement of American citizens, does show that Orthrus is aware of its enemies and is willing to act to defend itself accordingly.&amp;nbsp; In that case, we&#39;ll all be better off if we&#39;re not isolated in our own small encampments wishing the plague upon one another.

<title>&#8220;Do I Hafta?&#8221;&nbsp; Taking Kids Along</title>
<body>One of the common questions for parents with kids is do I hafta?, particularly regarding going along to another sibling&#39;s event or activity.&amp;nbsp; The answer is a no&#45;brainer when the child is too young to be home alone but when they can be left alone for a short period, or longer, but then it does take greater thought.&amp;nbsp; When can, and should, kids be allowed to stay home alone instead of tagging along for the sibling&#39;s activity?
Most kids are egocentric and this ramps up to a roaring crescendo in their early to mid teens.&amp;nbsp; If their sibling has something going on, the chronic refrain is the plaintive do I hafta?&amp;nbsp; It can be irritating since the question is repetitive and when there are more than one child involved, the decision may lead to discord as the budding jailhouse lawyers pick the answer apart.&amp;nbsp; She didn&#39;t have to go, why do I?&amp;nbsp; But he got to stay home and I have to go?&amp;nbsp; Where&#39;s the justice?&amp;nbsp; (Seriously, one of my kids lofted that comment and I simply laughed aloud in the child&#39;s face).&amp;nbsp; What are some considerations on whether the child stays or goes?

    How long can the child reasonably be home alone?&amp;nbsp; Kids don&#39;t mature at the same rate and some elementary schoolers could be home while you run older sibling to a practice.&amp;nbsp;
    Is there the possibility of intervening stops?&amp;nbsp; With cellphones, the prospect of plan changes rises as you&#39;re called with a request to stop somewhere and pick something up.&amp;nbsp; How far out of the way does that take you and can the child manage that (with a phone call letting him know)?&amp;nbsp; There have been instances when I&#39;ve refused the request because it didn&#39;t seem right to leave the child home any longer than was already the case.
    Is the sibling&#39;s activity a practice or an actual event, such as a game or a concert?&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s only a practice, then the questions&amp;nbsp;are whether you need to stay for the practice and it&#39;s duration.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s just a drop&#45;off, then perhaps the other can stay home but if it&#39;s far enough away that it&#39;s better to just stay, then toting the sibling makes more sense.&amp;nbsp; Our school district is geographically large and rec league soccer practices could be far enough away that it was impractical and expensive to come home and on those instances, I made it a point of bringing the others along and they could bring their books or games.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s an actual game or concert, then only a sibling&#39;s competing activity or schoolwork could keep the child home and in those instances of schoolwork, it&#39;s been understood that we&#39;ll check homework or quiz.
    Do you actually trust the kid to be home, either alone or with siblings?&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t, then you can anticipate considerable blowback but the risk of something bad occurring outweighs that.&amp;nbsp; Some years ago, an acquaintance related that&amp;nbsp;she went to the grocery store, figuring that she&#39;d be gone only for an hour and that her &#39;tweener son could be alone with her teen daughter and friend.&amp;nbsp; She returned home to find the boy handcuffed to a chair with his hair full of bows.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d cuffed himself to the chair, not knowing that there was no key, and sister and friend decided to take the opportunity to do his hair for him.&amp;nbsp; As she stated at the time, so I won&#39;t be leaving him home alone with her for awhile.
    This leads to the next question,are any of their peers going to be there?&amp;nbsp; Stupidity is contagious and the ability of &#39;tweeners and teens to assess risk ranks up there with the ability of Lindsay Lohan to make a community service date.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a very short list of kids with which I&#39;m comfortable being at the house unmonitored.

So what do I say when the kids, of whatever age, find that they&#39;re coming along to sibling&#39;s game?&amp;nbsp; The language that we&#39;ve used is that this is simply something that family does for one another, a visual way to show that we support each other in our chosen activities.&amp;nbsp; While I can say that other parents say the same, it&#39;s nice to find out that the kids talk with one another and find that the other parents really are saying the same thing as Middle noted during a chat with an acquaintance at school.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, my folks say that I&#39;ve got to go my brother&#39;s ballgame because that&#39;s what a family does for one another.&amp;nbsp; A tack that I&#39;ve taken with the older kids is this:&amp;nbsp; While a good part of your life was spent without Youngest in the picture, you&#39;ve always been a part of his life and he&#39;s never known life without you.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll be going off to college &#45; or wherever &#45; and you simply won&#39;t be around to see all of the cool things that he&#39;s probably going to do as he grows, and while he&#39;s always been there for you, you won&#39;t be there for him.&amp;nbsp; This is a comment that I&#39;ve only had to make once or twice and with each of the older kids and each time, it was met with a quiet look as each assessed its validity and acknowledged its truth.&amp;nbsp; It might not work with all kids, but I was gratified that neither Eldest nor Middle scoffed and derided it.
Like other parts of parenting, it can be frustrating to listen to the backtalk and griping.&amp;nbsp; But this is how the kids are learning that a family is more than just an accumulation of biologically related bodies within a household.

<title>Explaining Real World Consequences</title>
<body>Teens might be great with electronics and technology and their superiority gives them bragging rights over many parents; unfortunately, they then think that this transfers over to their understanding of what goes on in the real world.&amp;nbsp; Part of my job is to explain the real world to them, a world that is more complex and less forgiving than they&#39;ll understand for years to come.&amp;nbsp; Such is the case of explaining the consequences of stupid and/or illegal actions.
One of the kids shared that some friends were caught shoplifting $2 rubber wristbands from a mall retailer that caters to teens.&amp;nbsp; As explained to me, the manager caught them trying to exit the store with the trinkets and took them back to the office, where they subsequently were interviewed by both mall security and the local police.&amp;nbsp; Parents were subsequently contacted and the kids were released to their custody.&amp;nbsp; The subsequent conversation ran along the lines of...
But it&#39;s not a problem.&amp;nbsp; The cops said that it happens all of the time and nothing&#39;s going to hit their record if they don&#39;t do it again.&amp;nbsp;
So you&#39;re telling me that the police just released them with no actions taken by the store?&amp;nbsp;
My kid responded, well, they do have to pay a fine but nothing&#39;s going on their record, so it&#39;s really okay.
Kid, I retorted, if there&#39;s a fine to be paid, then there&#39;s a paper trail and believe me, something is going to hit their juvenile record.&amp;nbsp;
No, really, Dad &#45;&amp;nbsp;he interjected &#45; there&#39;s no record.&amp;nbsp;
It was at this point that my kid got a real&#45;world lesson.&amp;nbsp; Lemme tell you, there&#39;s a juvenile record and there&#39;s an adult record.&amp;nbsp; Your buddies have three years to not do something like this again in order for it to avoid their adult record.&amp;nbsp; If they screw up again, then they start off their adult life with a criminal record.&amp;nbsp; Period.&amp;nbsp; What does this mean?&amp;nbsp; When these kids go out to apply for summer&amp;nbsp;jobs and are asked on the application if there&#39;s any criminal history, they&#39;re screwed.&amp;nbsp; Forget about lying on the application because more and more employers are doing background checks and who wants a thief working for them?
My child pursed his lips and said nothing for a few seconds as he digested this.
So what did their parents say?&amp;nbsp; I asked.
My kid shook his head.&amp;nbsp; One guy&#39;s parents were super&#45;pissed and he&#3#39;s not only grounded, but he&#39;s lost all electronics and his guitar.&amp;nbsp; Same with the other guy, but his folks didn&#39;t yell.&amp;nbsp; They just shook their heads and asked what he&#39;d been thinking since he had at least $20 in his wallet.&amp;nbsp; Not much of a problem.
No, I said, it&#39;s a problem because he&#39;s truly disappointed his parents.&amp;nbsp; Their kid doesn&#39;t even have the excuse of saying that he didn&#39;t have any cash.&amp;nbsp;
Kids and teens will screw up and sometimes in a way reminiscent of a 20 car NASCAR wreck.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t have the experience and understanding to place events in a proper context and it&#39;s our job to teach them what the consequences of their actions will be.&amp;nbsp; If we don&#39;t do so, either because we&#39;re busy or it&#39;s unpleasant &#45; whatever the reason &#45; then they&#39;ll fall back to the default position of getting their information from their peers and in this case, the peers who actually screwed up.&amp;nbsp; The same kids who will minimize&amp;nbsp;out of embarrassment, a desire&amp;nbsp;to look cool or sheer incomprehension of what&#39;s actually happened.
The kids will make all manner of comments that can lead to conversations and some can be postponed to a more opportune moment.&amp;nbsp; This conversation however, was one that had to happen at that moment for fear that not making the point could lead to the conclusion that even Dad didn&#39;t consider it a big deal.&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, it&#39;s a big deal.

<title>Kids, Christmas and the Recession</title>
<body>On a short trip out of state today, I stopped at a sandwich joint for a quick lunch and as I waited, two of the counter waitresses talked about their Christmas shopping plans.&amp;nbsp; One listened as her coworker spoke of continuing to search for great deals so that her kids could have a good Christmas day.&amp;nbsp; The listener then complained that she now felt guilty for cutting back on Christmas presents.&amp;nbsp; On the cusp of a syndicated story about kids&#39; letters to Santa during recession&amp;nbsp;and how they&#39;re feeling the pinch, it begs the question of how to handle Santa and the kids when the money is truly tight.&amp;nbsp; Do you further impoverish yourself to keep appearances for the kids?
On the appearance hand, many parents want their children to believe in Santa for as long as possible.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a bittersweet wistfulness in the soul when the kids are old enough to leave Santa and what he represents; there&#39;s still years of their presence &#45; but an innocence is gone.&amp;nbsp; For the parents who are caught in a financial bind, Santa also represents a reprieve from the daily tension that the kids certainly notice when Mom and/or Dad are confronted with financial hardship.&amp;nbsp; What do I pay now?&amp;nbsp; Can I get an extension on this?&amp;nbsp; Children are sensitive to their parents and can easily discern when something&#39;s not right and the thought is that, at least on Christmas Day, things are as they&#39;re presented in the media and popular culture.
But appearance can and does give way to hard reality.&amp;nbsp; This particular story line has run before with similar stories in 2008, 2009&amp;nbsp;and 2010&amp;nbsp;and this reappearance is sympomatic of the ongoing implosion of the American Middle Class.&amp;nbsp; Kids are acutely aware that things are bad and are going to the one source that can work some kind of magic for their families, Santa Claus.&amp;nbsp; The key point however, is that in the midst of the correspondence, they aren&#39;t asking for themselves but instead for either what benefits the family or their parents, so that some sense of stability can be gained.&amp;nbsp; This, I think, is the key to the entire situation.&amp;nbsp; Parents have grown in an era of materialism and are almost programmed to think of the season in terms of things and wrapped presents; but these kids are now in the fourth year of a Great Retrenchment and those in the bind are writing off the materialism for something more fundamental, and that&#39;s a sense of stability and control.&amp;nbsp; Santa, forget the RC car and just help Dad find a job.&amp;nbsp; Then we can get back to what we had before.&amp;nbsp; What the kids are truly looking for is a sense of family, belonging and stability and that doesn&#39;t come from a specified number of wrapped gifts but instead from the time and efforts that we fathers and parents put into them.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s no clear answer to this question and some will disagree with me profoundly.&amp;nbsp; But in the final balance, what&#39;s the point of pushing Santa for the kids if the ensuing angst over how to cover the rent ruins the holiday season?&amp;nbsp; The kids would much rather know that the parents are doing everything that they can to keep things together and if they can contribute, then that&#39;s one way that they&#39;re probably willing to do so.&amp;nbsp; Our job as parents is to maintain as even a keel as possible and that&#39;s truly what the kids want, is to know that things are covered as much as possible.
If you&#39;re uncertain, then talk to the Santas when you see them in the store.</body>

<title>Kids and Pets:&nbsp; What to Consider</title>
<body>The lives of families are usually intertwined with animals.&amp;nbsp; It might be because the young couple got an animal after settling down or simply because the kids want one.&amp;nbsp; With the PracticalDad household now the residence of yet another cat and a purchased&#45;but&#45;not&#45;yet&#45;brought&#45;home snake, the questions remain, what are the issues regarding pets and when is it too much?
What to consider with kids and pets
The first and simplest question is, can your family actually handle having a pet?&amp;nbsp; All parents talk with the kids, once they&#39;re a little older, about their need to take some responsibility in caring for the animals.&amp;nbsp; Preschoolers can certainly be taught to parcel out the dog and cat food, or sprinkle a little bit into the fishtank, but the reality is that actually remembering to do it is going to probably devolve upon the parent.&amp;nbsp; The corollary to this is that if the kids are already involved in some other activity and the animal needs to be fed, then consider how you&#39;ll react when you&#39;re reminder is met with either inaction &#45; requiring another, more pointed reminder &#45; or the roll of the eyes.&amp;nbsp; If your schedule is full enough that a small activity such as even feeding, let alone walking and fecal duties, creates a mood&#45;altering imposition, then reconsider it again.
Will the pet continue to stay small and cute, or is it going to grow into some else entirely?&amp;nbsp; Kittens and puppies are cute enough for many that it makes up for the actual work that&#39;s involved with very young animals.&amp;nbsp; But these grow up to be adult animals with their own personalities and quirks and the ongoing care will no longer be outweighed by the cuteness factor.
Does the animal even make sense?&amp;nbsp; About a year ago, Eldest showed up at the backdoor with a friend that she wanted me to meet &#45; that&#39;s a danger signal by itself &#45; and the box that the friend had brought along.&amp;nbsp; After the introduction, during which my eyes periodically wandered to the magic wonder box, she divulged that the inhabitant was a duckling for whom her friend was trying to find a home.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because her friend had thought that a duck would be a wonderful addition to the family and her own father had laid it at her doorstep.&amp;nbsp; Not only are we not taking in a damned duckling, but you&#39;re going to find it a decent home.&amp;nbsp; We were probably the fourth stop on the duckling&#39;s home adoption tour and when the girls couldn&#39;t even identify what it would do in the coming wintertime &#45; I think that it&#39;ll head south... &#45; her mother and I agreed to foster the duckling until we found a decent farm on which it could live.&amp;nbsp; Dogs and cats make sense, even hamsters and snakes, but to consider taking in a duck solely because we have a small fishpond is lunacy.
What&#39;s the cost of the animal?&amp;nbsp; Well cared for animals typically have their own particular foods and diets and that&#39;s a cost.&amp;nbsp; Cats additionally require litter and when you factor in the vet bills, having pets can be expensive.&amp;nbsp; Wander through the local humane league and you&#39;ll probably find any number of sad animals who&#39;ve been given up their owners because they couldn&#39;t handle the cost.
When is it too much?
Apart from clear factors such as cost and sheer generated workload, this is a highly subjective question.&amp;nbsp; In our household, the kids who want to bring in additional pets had better be able to answer certain questions and get their information straight for the verbal quiz.&amp;nbsp; While Eldest campaigned for years for a reptile or snake, she could never quite get the information straight and her answers led to other questions.&amp;nbsp; So this thing doesn&#39;t eat mice, but just crickets?&amp;nbsp; Do they have to be alive or dead crickets and must I concerned about crickets escaping into the house?&amp;nbsp; What about the noise that these crickets are going to make through the night?&amp;nbsp; Youngest however, was watching this and through the years, prepared himself so that when we talked about it, he was clear on what was involved in caring for a reptile or snake.&amp;nbsp; For his part, he&#39;s willing to feed it a mouse each week and is very clear that the day that I have to stun a live mouse and feed the snake is probably the snake&#39;s last day in this household.
The upshot is that he purchased a snake with his own money this weekend and we covered the habitat for his Christmas.&amp;nbsp; When we assembled the various parts of the habitat last night, he didn&#39;t grumble when I made him read the instructions aloud to me and he even commented that this item or that was something he didn&#39;t realize.
The other aspect to whether it&#39;s too much is the question of time.&amp;nbsp; Eldest still campaigns for yet another pet in her room but we&#39;ve told her no since with less than a year until college, she wouldn&#39;t be around to care for whatever it was she wanted and the uncertainty as to college dorm regulations made it impracticable.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s one thing to take in a family pet with run of the household, but another entirely to take in a creature which has appeal to only one person, who&#39;s only there for a certain time longer.
So as it stands now, we&#39;re up to one dog, four cats and in the next day, a corn snake.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s enough for me.

<title>Teachable Moments:&nbsp; Torture, Politics and Honking</title>
<body>There are any number of teachable moments for kids, instances in which you can seize the opportunity to explain what&#39;s seen as well as what&#39;s happening in the world.&amp;nbsp; Such was the case this weekend as I drove Youngest to the library in a nearby city and passed the small local Occupy encampment, which presented a spectrum of topics to consider.&amp;nbsp; This was especially the case as I honked at a middle&#45;aged man holding a sign which read Honk if you remember when torture wasn&#39;t an American value!
Dad, why were you beeping the horn?&amp;nbsp; I responded as to why I honked the horn and what the sign said, which led to a conversation about torture.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, Youngest &#45; at age&amp;nbsp;nine &#45; knew precisely what waterboarding was and we chatted about both why it was used and why people were opposed to it, now including me.&amp;nbsp;
Is that the only torture that we use?&amp;nbsp; My answer was that while it was the only torture technique that our country utilized (so far as I know), we did ship prisoners off to other nations who were open to other, more imaginative methods.&amp;nbsp; Well, what&#39;s the difference then?&amp;nbsp; By this point, we&#39;d pulled into the library parking lot and I could only tell him that so far as I could see, he was right in that there was no difference.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t mention that those who assigned a difference were only raising a facade &#45; frankly because then I&#39;d have to explain the meaning of the term facade.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The exchange, from honking to parking, took about five minutes and that was a decent timeframe for his age level.
Bill Cosby once performed a hilarious routine about kids and questions, entitled Why is there air?&amp;nbsp; The Cosby response was a simple four words:&amp;nbsp; to blow up basketballs.&amp;nbsp; The gist is that kids are curious and want to know what&#39;s going on around them and it&#39;s one of my primary responsibilities to explain the world to them.&amp;nbsp; But the younger ones neither want nor need lengthy lectures or conversations.&amp;nbsp; They simply need a few minutes at most to give the basic reasons.&amp;nbsp; In Cosby&#39;s monologue, the child was probably a preschooler and not into upper elementary school, but the point is the same.&amp;nbsp; Keep it simple and neat, and then break it off lest the kid go into his yada yada yada mode.
Daily life is rife with teachable moments, some sweet and others not so &#45; like waterboarding and torture.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, keep your ear tuned for the question and be ready to engage whenever it arises.

<title>December PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Prices Up Again</title>
<body>December&#39;s marketbasket was priced and the data from the three unrelated stores shows that prices are up again after a three month respite, to an index level of 106.49, or about 6.5% from the original prices in November 2010.&amp;nbsp; This is a rise of almost one full percentage point and is the highest monthly increase since July&#39;s jump of 1.14%.&amp;nbsp; This increase is on the back of four items &#45; store brand frosted flake cereal (5.1%), peanut butter (4.7%), Gorton&#39;s Fish Sticks (9.7%) and potatoes (18%).&amp;nbsp; The peanut butter increase is purely a function of supply as the crop suffered and the fish price is on the back of a 28% rise at one particular store, so it&#39;s uncertain if this is a precursor to the other stores raising prices or simply a&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;one&#45;off&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;abnormality.&amp;nbsp; The other item of note is that once again, the number of items with a price increase (15) is higher than those with price decreases (7), a reversal of the November situation in which prices actually dropped.

<title>PracticalDad and Black Friday</title>
<body>With the news that the 2011 Christmas shopping season opened with Black Friday sales up about 6+% from last year, it might be interesting to compare &#45; on a personal level &#45; how this Black Friday compared with previous Black Fridays.&amp;nbsp; For more than five years, I&#39;ve been one of those folks who showed up in line for the earliest sales in order to get the sales items under the Christmas tree and with the older kids, it&#39;s become a family tradition to go out in the middle of the night with close family friends and tagteam different stores and sales.&amp;nbsp; This year, the kids are getting older and we&#39;ve made it abundantly clear that our summer family vacation was the big gift, so I almost didn&#39;t go; Middle asked so that he and a friend could do some shopping on his very limitied budget and I agreed and spent my time people&#45;watching with a cup of coffee.&amp;nbsp; So what&#39;s different this year?
The first difference is how the marketing gurus and retailers are now playing up the shopping with advertising and the sales of &amp;quot;loss leading&amp;quot; items to get people in the doors.&amp;nbsp; I rarely shop at Toys R Us anymore but was there&amp;nbsp; one morning last week and in a chat with the sales clerk, she commented that instead of opening at midnight like other retailers, they were actually opening at 9 PM on Thanksgiving night and that she&#39;d be there even earlier.&amp;nbsp; She shook her head and simply said, they&#39;re taking our holiday from us.&amp;nbsp; In the moment, she meant her employer while I saw it as the entire economic machine.&amp;nbsp; Throughout the days prior to Thanksgiving, the media was filled with ads and reminders about the offers that would be available and how the earlier hours were there to be even more hospitable to the customer.&amp;nbsp; While the ostensible thrust is great deals and savings for the debt&#45;laden consumer, the reality is that this is purely another way to gin up sales figures for the retailers, another in the panting gasps of the consumerist mentality.
Second, there were far more small children out than I recall seeing when I first started going out years ago.&amp;nbsp; Seven years ago, the stores that were open at 4 AM had lines snaking through the cold outdoors and were populated entirely by adults, more than a few of whom were grandparents.&amp;nbsp; This year, the doors to the mall themselves were open by midnight and when I wandered through the food court about 2 AM, the child&#39;s playarea had at least a half dozen small children running and playing.&amp;nbsp; Are the parents so strapped that they&#39;ll take the kids out at those hours in order to help assure that the tree has gifts?
Third, there are far more stores opening at the early/late hours than there were eight years ago; so much so that the mall itself opened its doors at midnight.&amp;nbsp; When I first started going out, there were only a small handful that opened at 4 AM and a line would form outside a mall entrance, people prepared to enter when the mall doors were opened.&amp;nbsp; By the time that I left at 330 AM for breakfast with the kids, roughly half of the mall stores were open and the place was crawling with more people at that hour than on a typical weekend evening.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s also of note is that a number of those stores open early eight years ago are now consigned to the retail morgue &#45; Linens N Things, Circuit City, KB Toys &#45; and I wonder, how many of these stores now opening at these hours are also not long for this world?
Fourth, despite the news reports of shopper violence, it&#39;s apparent that the retailers are pushing to maintain control.&amp;nbsp; Walmart now staggers when certain items are put on sale and those interested have to come early for a ticket and then return later to a predetermined line.&amp;nbsp; Other retailers have staff outside beforehand helping to maintain order and there was significant police and security presence at the Walmart and mall.&amp;nbsp; It left a bitter taste in my mouth as it reinforces the notion that we consumers exist solely to enrich the corporations and must be controlled as they happily take our money.
Even after Black Friday had ended, the retailers were ginning up the sales machine for what they refer to as Cyber Monday.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t want to go out because you&#39;re working the next day?&amp;nbsp; Not to worry since you can now get all of the deals online!&amp;nbsp; Because we have a UPromise credit card and take the rebates as they&#39;re needed, my wife went online last night and noted that at some retailers, such as Sears, the rebates were not only higher at 10% of the sale price, but that using the credit card for the purchase would yield rebates of 21%.&amp;nbsp; Rebating one fifth?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s telling about the health not only of the retailer, but also of the credit card bank, which is Bank of America.&amp;nbsp; The credit card rate is in the teens &#45; we usually pay ours off monthly &#45; and with most cardholders carrying a balance, the drive is to keep the balances high&amp;nbsp;and collect the interest and fees for the bank&#39;s bottom line.
What&#39;s happening is a huge exercise in what financial types call pulling the demand forward.&amp;nbsp; The premise is that there&#39;s an organic demand for merchandise as people replace what they have or either shift upwards or downwards and that offering such deep discounts will cause them to buy what they need or want now instead of waiting until later.&amp;nbsp; But the problem is that once that demand is pulled forward, what&#39;s going to sustain it in the future?&amp;nbsp; With declining real incomes and uncertainty as to jobs, people are likely to grab what they can now, but the wallet will be closed later.
And my spending through this year?&amp;nbsp; With the kids growing and the checkbook shut, my purchases were minimal.&amp;nbsp; The bulk of my time was spent nursing&amp;nbsp;a cup of coffee and enjoying a very early egg breakfast with Middle and his friends.&amp;nbsp; My expectation is that next year, it&#39;ll simply be the breakfast.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Slang:&nbsp; Of Opies, Forcepushing and Duckpecking</title>
<body>Every job has its own slang and over the years, I&#39;ve heard any number of words and phrases to describe childrearing.&amp;nbsp; Here are some of my favorites.
Blowout (n)
A blowout is anytime that an infant or toddler defecates in such volume or force that the mess escapes the diaper and travels throughout the clothing.&amp;nbsp; The worst blowout occurs with the mess traveling up the back and soiling the clothing; since much infant clothing involves something that&#39;s pulled over the head, this type will throw a wrench in the schedule as removing the clothing &#45; and mess &#45; will almost certainly get into the hair, requiring a bath.
Junior&#39;s blowout was so massive that I almost called in the National Guard.
Colt (adj, n)
The stage in development in which a child&#39;s body has outgrown it&#39;s own capacity to adequately control and manuever it, marked by outsized hands and feet.
(After watching Junior trip twice and fall once enroute to the curb)&amp;nbsp; Junior&#39;s looking rather coltish this morning, isn&#39;t he?&amp;nbsp; See Also:&amp;nbsp; Now that his shoe size is higher than his ability to count, he&#39;s officially in the colt stage.
Charlie (n)
The spoken part of the phrase, the unspoken first part being &amp;quot;half&#45;ass&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Half&#45;ass Charlie refers to those kids and teens who will do the most slapdash job possible just to say that it&#39;s done.&amp;nbsp; This term was used by a school custodian in a conversation about students who&#39;d been tasked with helping to clean as discipline for misbehavior.
She should know better than that, that job&#39;s the work of an absolute Charlie.
Duckpecking (n, v)
Source:&amp;nbsp; A mother who was commenting on the parenting of teens, it&#39;s like being pecked to death by ducks.&amp;nbsp; The repeated and sometimes infuriating practice of being hounded by &#39;tweeners and teens who persist in their interruptions and requests, even despite having been consistently given an answer already.
When Junior doesn&#39;t like the answer that he&#39;s given, he goes right into duckpecking mode.&amp;nbsp; See Also:&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s a nasty little duckpecker, ain&#39;t he?
Facepalm (adj)
The physical reaction of rubbing one&#39;s face with the hand out of sheer disbelief at what Junior has just done or said.&amp;nbsp; This is&amp;nbsp;sometimes a precursor to a massive headache or mild stroke.
Mike had a facepalm moment when he walked into Junior&#39;s room and found that the boys had used the wall for knife&#45;throwing practice after practicing their signatures with permanent marker on the bedroom&#39;s hardwood floor.&amp;nbsp;
Force Push (n, v)
An action, typically used by kids and tweeners, to keep annoying people away.&amp;nbsp; When the user is being bothered by someone, he either spits or heavily licks his palm so that it&#39;s copiously wet and then sticks it in the face of the annoying party,&amp;nbsp;thus repelling him backwards to avoid having spit rubbed in his face.&amp;nbsp; The term is inspired by the Jedi of the Star Wars films (although I&#39;ve never seen a clip of Obi&#45;Wan hocking a loogie into his hand).&amp;nbsp;
Randy wouldn&#39;t stop looking over my shoulder during free reading so I did a force push to get him to go away.
Monkeyhammering (adj, v)
Based upon the premise that if you give a monkey a hammer, that&#39;s what he&#39;ll use for every problem and challenge.&amp;nbsp; This is the situation in which a child of any age uses what they know to achieve the task at hand, regardless of the damage done to the item.
Several days after reading this and mentally noting the phrase on Zerohedge&amp;nbsp;just last week, my wife and I got to experience it first hand.
The kids really monkeyhammered the KitchenAid Stand&#45;up Mixer; when I asked them to clean the dried&amp;nbsp;batter off of&amp;nbsp;it, they tossed it into a sink full of hot, soapy water and then rinsed it off with the spray nozzle.
Opie (n)
Name used to describe any (O)ther (P)erson&#39;s kid.&amp;nbsp; Even if the kid winds up spending more time with you than at their own home, they&#39;re an Opie.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, your own kid is someone else&#39;s Opie.
I went to pick up Junior after practice and ended up giving rides home to three other Opies.
Waldo (n)
A child with a tendency to wander away, as in Where&#39;s Waldo now?
Oh great, I&#39;m chaperoning Fiona during the field trip.&amp;nbsp; I hear that she&#39;s a Waldo.
Windowlicker (n)
A term once used by another father as we discussed the upcoming Kindergarten year for our respective sons, who are two weeks apart in age.&amp;nbsp; It refers to a kid who, while not retarded or dumb, is simply odd and spastic.
Y&#39;know, every father&#39;s fear is that when the bus pulls away on that first morning, his kid&#39;s gonna be the windowlicker.&amp;nbsp; The one kid who, while all the other kids are waving goodbye, is licking the back window instead.
I still laugh when I think about that particular remark.

<title>Some Thoughts on Becoming a &#8220;Stay-at-Home Dad&#8221;</title>
<body>What should I be aware of if I&#39;m going to stay home with the kids?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a move that&#39;s being increasingly made by men, whether by choice or by necessity, via job loss.&amp;nbsp; Whatever your situation, there are certainly things to be considered since the overwhelming majority of men were never raised with the thought that they&#39;d be the primary caregivers for their children and it was never in their top 25 list of occupational choices when they were kids.&amp;nbsp; So what should you consider?
What is your timeframe?
Is this something that you&#39;re doing while you&#39;re looking for a paying job or is this a more permanent role?&amp;nbsp; It matters because it impacts how you structure the day with the kids, and with kids, structure is crucial.&amp;nbsp; Children thrive when they have some sense of structure and routine because this creates a sense of security and with this sense, they&#39;re more likely to actually feel more secure and confident of their ability to handle life.&amp;nbsp;
If you understand that this is a one year gig, then give serious consideration to maintaining a bedtime/morning routine that reflects the fact that your child will have to arise early enough to make it to daycare in the future.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that every morning has to be up and moving by 6:15 AM, but if you get into the habit of letting the kids awaken later, then you&#39;ll have to be prepared to gradually work them back into that schedule when the return&#45;to&#45;work date becomes closer.&amp;nbsp; Kids can be flexible but most will do better if they&#39;re eased into something over a period of time.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re staying home with the kids while you&#39;re looking for a job, then try to take the kids into account as you do the followups.&amp;nbsp; If the kids need to be quietly occupied while you handle phone calls, then&amp;nbsp; consider when those calls have to happen and build the television time into that time frame; early afternoon calls dictate that screen time occurs in the early afternoon.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind however, that having the kids in front of the television or computer for the average six hours daily is probably one of the worst things that can happen so you also have to structure other activities for the morning and late afternoon.
How do you handle being the odd&#45;man out?
Everybody&#39;s talked about job discrimination for women and it&#39;s a legitimate issue with true grievances, but most aren&#39;t aware that the issue has also existed for men who are at home with the kids.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s certainly better than it was and there are many women who have happily accepted my children and I into their lives, the fact is that there have been some who aren&#39;t comfortable with their children playing at the home in which the man is the primary caregiver.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s not an issue now that my kids are a bit older &#45; and we actively encourage our kids to bring their friends here &#45; there were definitely periods when they were very young that I, and my kids by extensions, was the odd man out.&amp;nbsp; When Eldest &#45; now a high school senior &#45; was very little, I had a real sense of being isolated as neighborhood mothers that I met at the park would balk at establishing playdates when they discovered that I was the one with whom they and their kids would be spending time.&amp;nbsp; In the moment, it was terribly frustrating as my toddler was unable to play with her peers outside of the park.&amp;nbsp; Was it because of me personally?&amp;nbsp; Were there concerns about the appearance of any sexual impropriety?&amp;nbsp; Were they uncomfortable with the fact that a historically female role was now being filled by a man?
Do you and your mate have common expectations?
The blending and shifting of parental roles has really grown in the past quarter century and while it seems like a long time on a personal level &#45; I wasn&#39;t even married then &#45; it isn&#39;t a long span on a societal level.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve now had roughly two generations of women who have been raised with the idea that they are every bit as capable as men professionally, but the offset is that we&#39;ve only had about one generation of men who have begun to literally decide that they are every bit as capable raising children as their mates.&amp;nbsp; Does it make the women bad mothers?&amp;nbsp; Absolutely not.&amp;nbsp; Does it mean that men are automatically great fathers?&amp;nbsp; Absolutely not.&amp;nbsp; But it does mean that there are very different levels of expectations by both parties on what&#39;s involved in raising the kids and running the household.&amp;nbsp; It also means that there&#39;s real potential for anger, miscommunication and discord on the part of both of you.
Where&#39;s the balance between housework and hands&#45;on childrearing?&amp;nbsp; Who&#39;s responsible for paying the bills and the everyday finances?&amp;nbsp; Who&#39;s responsible for the longer&#45;term financial planning?&amp;nbsp; Is it one of you or do you&amp;nbsp; share?&amp;nbsp; Who decides the menu and does the cooking?
Even if and when you and your mate answer these questions, consider what the expectations are within each of the categories and even whether the expectations are achievable by the parent charged with the role.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case regarding men and housework since most men were never purposefully taught about housework by their parents, either what should be done or how it&#39;s done.&amp;nbsp; The result is that working women returning home are frustrated that one thing or another either hasn&#39;t been accomplished or else is poorly done with the woman doing it herself to much exasperation on both her, and the man&#39;s, part.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, this is an area which has periodically plagued me and it&#39;s only been through considerable effort and time that my wife has come to realize that housework simply wasn&#39;t something that I was ever taught;&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had to learn to acknowledge that questions borne out of frustration are simply that and that I really should learn so that&#39;s it done properly in the first place.
Do you define your value to the family in terms of money alone?
Men have historically been the breadwinners and have come to very narrowly define their contribution to the family in terms of how well they provide, and that&#39;s measured in dollars and sense.&amp;nbsp; Women have viewed their role in a wider sense apart from money, although that&#39;s also been included to some degree as economic necessity dictates.&amp;nbsp; Spend some time deciding how you view your role/contribution to the family and whether you actually believe that there&#39;s more to it than money alone.&amp;nbsp; Just as I&#39;ve met women who didn&#39;t quite know what to do with a male homemaker, there have also been men who&#39;ve been dismissive because I have no income so you&#39;re going to periodically hear it from both genders.
How comfortable are you with uncertainty and doubt?
This sounds odd and it&#39;s taken me some thought&amp;nbsp;to consider whether to include it, but raising children is an uncertain proposition.&amp;nbsp; The uncertainty starts early &#45; why is she crying?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s going on with her teeth? &#45; but is localized to a specific area bounded by the child and the immediate vicinity.&amp;nbsp; But as the child grows and moves out into the world, and that&#39;s precisely why we&#39;re raising them, the circumstances and the reasons for the uncertainty change from the physical and concrete to the mental/emotional and the abstract.&amp;nbsp; How is she developing?&amp;nbsp; Who are his friends and how is he interacting with them?&amp;nbsp; Because men have historically directed themselves outwards, it&#39;s been the women who&#39;ve focused on these aspects and these questions and concerns.&amp;nbsp; Now that women are increasingly spending their time and attention with the outside world, it&#39;s up to the father to begin taking up that particular slack.&amp;nbsp; These are questions for which there are no easily discernible answers and it&#39;s a world of grey.&amp;nbsp; Understand then, that if you&#39;re going to take much greater responsibility for the childrearing, then you have to be both willing and able to consider these amorphous areas.
Becoming the primary caregiver &#45; the &amp;quot;homemaker&amp;quot; &#45; was never something on my radar and when my wife first suggested it years before the birth of our first child, my response was incredulity.&amp;nbsp; But despite the challenges and trepidation, it&#39;s been an experience that I&amp;nbsp;wouldn&#39;t trade for the world; in a sense, a journey in a country largely unexplored by many of my male peers.&amp;nbsp; Like any successful expedition however, the trick is to have a sense of what lies ahead and some decent preparation for what&#39;s to come.

<title>Object Lessons</title>
<body>Keep talking, they&#39;re listening is a constant refrain in my head with my kids, even if the eyes roll and the response is an exasperated FINE!&amp;nbsp; But that only goes so far and even if they&#39;re listening, they might simply choose to ignore it.&amp;nbsp; In that case, when should I stop simply saying anything at all?&amp;nbsp; Is there value in the object lesson and is the potential severity of an incident such that there&#39;s benefit in there&#39;s actually greater value in an object lesson learned?
Parenting is partially a job in assessing risk &#45; what can go wrong and just how bad can it be &#45; and reacting to it accordingly.&amp;nbsp; In the child&#39;s early years, the great majority do everything possible to protect our kids.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s an entire industry built around safety devices and we buy into it accordingly.&amp;nbsp; As a former claims adjuster, I remember the times when Eldest was napping in her crib and I dropped to hands and knees to survey the world from the baby&#39;s level, asking myself what are the hazards here?&amp;nbsp; At those ages, the child simply doesn&#39;t recognize what can hurt her and it&#39;s my job to protect her.&amp;nbsp; But as she grows, she begins to understand and put things together and can actually modify her actions to Dad&#39;s instructions and that&#39;s where the fun starts.&amp;nbsp; If I take her to the park and she persists in doing something stupid, at what point do I simply decide to let her have an object lesson?&amp;nbsp; What could go wrong and how bad could the likely results be?&amp;nbsp; There are no clear answers and what one father perceives can be very different from another father.
The nature of the situation changes as the kids age and grow, but it continues to exist.&amp;nbsp; By a certain point, you can&#39;t protect them from their own stupidity all of the time because you&#39;re simply not around and you can&#39;t wrap them in a bubble, but there are other ways to teach the object lesson; it now goes more frequently to the concept of self&#45;responsibility.&amp;nbsp; In my case, it goes to the world of school and the ubiquitous permission form because as I&#39;ve told Middle repeatedly, Dude, these exist for a reason apart from killing trees.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been often enough that deadlines have passed simply because no form was ever delivered and in some cases, never even remembered that forms were even handed out; the resulting angst as we scramble to keep situations under control creating sufficient uproar that it becomes apparent that jawboning simply won&#39;t work.&amp;nbsp;
Hence the object lessons.&amp;nbsp; The beauty of the internet is that we can surveille what&#39;s happening via the school district website and see what&#39;s on the horizon and that was the case several months ago as the word went out Remember to have your forms in by April 1 in order to attend the end&#45;of&#45;year field trip to the Amusement Park!&amp;nbsp; Given the repeated situations, the decision was to sit on it and sure enough, the form wasn&#39;t turned in and Middle missed the field trip.&amp;nbsp; However, since his option was to then sit in a classroom for an all&#45;day study hall, I kept him home and he did significant yardwork.&amp;nbsp; We thought that the lesson was learned but sure enough, the missed form occurred again last week as a Fall play cast party was thrown in doubt and when I responded to another parent that he probably wouldn&#39;t attend because of a blown form, her response was that it was a harsh lesson.&amp;nbsp; Since I&#39;d also stated that I suspected that there was a permission slip out there that I&#39;d never followed on, the comment was directed at me.&amp;nbsp;
Is it harsh?&amp;nbsp; Probably so since the kid truly did an outstanding job with the show.&amp;nbsp; But I, like many parents, tire of the constant picking that occurs because the kids can&#39;t or won&#39;t step up to the plate on issues of responsibility and when the opportunity to let the system teach a lesson, I&#39;m going to grab it with both hands and ride it for all that it&#39;s worth.&amp;nbsp; The kids will learn that a favored activity isn&#39;t going to happen not because Dad didn&#39;t make it happen, but&amp;nbsp;because they didn&#39;t make it happen.
As it went, Middle did make the cast party since he found out that the form was due at the door and had it to me that morning before the final show.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, they were nicer than I&#39;d have been.</body>

<title>Playing the College Numbers Game</title>
<body>Eldest leaves this afternoon with her mother for the last college visit, an out&#45;of&#45;state overnighter and with that, it then becomes a game of wait&#45;and&#45;see.&amp;nbsp; Wait and see who finally accepts her &#45; although she&#39;s a rocket scientist, like her mother &#45; and wait and see what the final numbers are for the cost after the financial aid packages are received.&amp;nbsp; But does it have to be a wait&#45;and&#45;see scenario or&amp;nbsp;can she just acknowledge an acceptance and be done with it before Christmas?
The biggest lesson that we&#39;ve learned from watching others in the past several years is that you should never, never, ever apply to a school early admission and that is because it&#39;s a question of timing.&amp;nbsp; The typical early decision process is meant to be completed in the November/December timeframe, which is at least weeks in advance of when the standard FAFSA financial aid paperwork is due from the families to the institutions.&amp;nbsp; Any student who applies early decision is contractually locked into attending without ever knowing what the financial aid package is going to be and we&#39;ve witnessed multiple situations in which the final package from the early decision institution wasn&#39;t what the teen and parents expected.&amp;nbsp; There are&amp;nbsp;occasions when early decision isn&#39;t an issue, but the implications can make it problematic.&amp;nbsp; The consumer advice given to parents has been that early decision should be largely avoided, with the student and parents using the various aid packages as negotiating levers to improve the financing from the favored college.&amp;nbsp; If you can shift $5000 from Parent Loans to grants, then Fiona can make it as one of your incoming students and boy, what an asset she&#39;d be!&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s a poster child for Ol&#39; Wassamatta U and can&#39;t you just imagine that tousle&#45;haired, cross&#45;eyed, gap&#45;toothed smile on the cover of your 2014 recruitment brochure?&amp;nbsp; The institutional rejoinder is that the demand for their services is high enough that there are other students who can fill that spot, as though our kids are cogs in the Big Ed machinery.&amp;nbsp; But the drumbeats about the college debt are sinking in as my wife learned in a recent admissions lecture that the number of schools being applied to by high school students has increased significantly in the past several years; the upshot is that the colleges are no longer certain how many students will actually accept offers and these institutions are in business, with seats to be filled come September.&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s still worth the effort to take a shot at negotiating the package.
In our case, Eldest is interested in a college that is upfront about this early decision dilemma.&amp;nbsp; Their practice is to give the families a best&#45;guess estimate on what they could expect from an aid package should their child want to enter via early decision.&amp;nbsp; The caveat is a quid&#45;pro&#45;quo in that the family provides a non&#45;FAFSA financial statement in the Fall and the school provides an estimate of what to expect with an aid package in the Winter/Spring.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s some uncertainty on both sides as the family numbers might not be what in January what they were earlier and the aid package might not be exactly what was promised, but the numbers might be enough to actually make the case on whether or not early decision should even be on the table.&amp;nbsp; This past weekend, my wife and I sat down with the financial paperwork to complete this college&#39;s process and we&#39;ll now see what the prospect looks like.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s out of the ballpark, then we&#39;ll have to consider whether the application is early or regular decision.&amp;nbsp;
So it&#39;s still wait&#45;and&#45;see.

<title>(huh)Whipped</title>
<body>If you&#39;re like me, you sometimes think if I had said that to my old man, he&#39;d have had me against a wall.&amp;nbsp; Such was the sense the other evening as an encounter with my teens and a few of their peers blossomed into a surreal fencing match over Seth McFarlane&#39;s Family Guy.&amp;nbsp; The point of the conversation was whether I was (huh)whipped, and if you watch Stewie, you get the reference.
For the record, I find Family Guy to be screamingly funny even if it does occasionally veer into the realm of the insensitive; McFarlane&#39;s parody song about Terry Schiavo is a case in point.&amp;nbsp; My wife however, finds it utterly distasteful.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, I &#45; and the older kids &#45; have watched it in her absence but make it a point to keep it off when she&#39;s around out of some respect for her opinion.&amp;nbsp; Years ago, I even purchased Season One on DVD but after realizing how much she hated it, I put it away in a secure place and have never actually watched it, again, out of respect for her real dislike of the program.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve never actually gotten rid of it because I&#39;d forgotten about it.
The situation occurred when the two teens, along with several of their peers, asked if they could watch the DVD collection and I refused to get it for them.&amp;nbsp; They persisted &#45; no self&#45;respecting teen stops at the first shot &#45; and when I held my ground and explained that I&#39;d put the set away out of respect, was informed that I was whipped.&amp;nbsp; The sparring continued and in reference to the fact that it was Family Guy, I corrected them by stating that I wasn&#39;t whipped, but actually (huh)whipped (for the uninformed, when a word starts with &amp;quot;wh&amp;quot;, Stewie pronounces it by saying &amp;quot;huh&amp;quot; in front of the &amp;quot;w&amp;quot; and hence the joke).&amp;nbsp; My initial thought was that the comment was truly disrespectful and I admit to almost losing my temper, but decided in the moment to pursue the discussion.&amp;nbsp; My goal was to make them think about adult relationships and the question of what a&amp;nbsp;couple owes&amp;nbsp;one another.&amp;nbsp; This multi&#45;level, multi&#45;player conversation continued on one level, funny, and on another, deadly serious as different scenarios were explored.&amp;nbsp; What does it mean to be &amp;quot;whipped&amp;quot;?&amp;nbsp; Several of you have boyfriends or girlfriends &#45; if you refuse to do something out of respect for them, does that make you whipped?&amp;nbsp; How do you feel if your significant other does something, knowing that you really detest it?&amp;nbsp;
The encounter lasted for several minutes, about what you&#39;d expect from a pack of teens looking for a few yucks, with the result being that they settled on another movie and they then disappeared downstairs.&amp;nbsp;
The points&amp;nbsp;are these.&amp;nbsp;

    &amp;nbsp;Parenting is going to take you outside of your comfort zone as you&#39;re challenged by kids who are pushing the boundaries in their testing of independence.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s much easier to somehow simply slough off the topic but it&#39;s our obligation as parents to swallow our bile and stick through the unpleasantry just so that the words are out there.&amp;nbsp; The kids might not like it, but I guarantee you that they&#39;re listening and processing if you&#39;re willing to proceed.
    The kids will learn about how to manage their relationships by watching you and how you consider your mate.&amp;nbsp; Each adult relationship has its dysfunctionality and the kids will pick up on that, but they&#39;ll also pick up on the good things that you do and how you choose to honor your mate.&amp;nbsp; In that moment, to allow myself to be manipulated by a pack of teens so as to not appear (huh)whipped by my spouse would have taught horrendous unspoken lessons.

And for the record, I&#39;m throwing out the Season One DVD set when I can remember where I put it.</body>

<title>The King is Dead, Long Live&#8230;?</title>
<body>The King is Dead.&amp;nbsp; Long Live the King!
The classic lines were to be uttered by a Royal Chamberlain to announce the death of a monarch, followed by an oath of fealty to the new king.&amp;nbsp; These words stay with me as I consider what&#39;s occurring around me, and I&#39;ve actually paraphrased them to my older children as we talk about financial issues and money.&amp;nbsp; The old model is dead, long live whatever it is that&#39;s coming, but I&#39;ll be damned if I know.
For the past several generations, our economic model has been predicated upon end&#45;user consumption.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s us, folks, as we spend unbelievable amounts on stuff and then in a few years, try to sell it at a garage sale to make some more to either cover the bills that should&#39;ve been paid in the first place, or else buy a bit more stuff.&amp;nbsp; But with the wall of debt that&#39;s been built over the past 25 years &#45; personal, corporate and public &#45; there&#39;s simply no way that we can continue with this model, and all of the drama in Europe is ultimately about the realization that there simply aren&#39;t enough productive assets to support their Picasso&#39;s version of a Jenga tower.&amp;nbsp;
I&#39;m not smart enough to foresee what&#39;s coming and frankly, don&#39;t believe anyone else who states that they do because much of the policy response is being made up on the fly.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s become very clear that this model of economic growth based upon consumerism is dying, and doing so quickly.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the message that I now try to hammer into the heads of my children as they grow into a very different economic environment.&amp;nbsp; The principal lessons?

    Learn to live on less and save your money.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s presently a war on savers as rates are kept excruciatingly low, but rates swing on a pendulum and at some point, they&#39;ll be forced upwards again.&amp;nbsp; Those who will do well at that time will be those who have learned how to live within their means now and the psychic adjustment will be much less difficult.
    Understand what your priorities are.&amp;nbsp; Do you want a home of your own?&amp;nbsp; Then work towards that.&amp;nbsp; Do you want to educate the kids with little debt?&amp;nbsp; Then work towards that.&amp;nbsp; But remember that despite what the advertisers proclaim, you can&#39;t have it all.
    Figure out what really matters yourself and then actively share that with the kids.&amp;nbsp; Share with them that there are people who don&#39;t have such basics as a secure home and food, then share with them how important these things are in comparison to new cars or the latest electronic gear.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, when I pray with Youngest at night, I purposefully give thanks for food and four walls and a roof; he learns that if I&#39;m thanking God for that, then it must be important.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re not a believer or don&#39;t pray, find another way to get the message across.
    Teach the kids about needs versus wants.&amp;nbsp; Talk with them about the concept of friendship and help them determine who really cares and matters.&amp;nbsp; Dad, isn&#39;t it cool that General Mills will donate a dime of each cereal box sold to our schools?&amp;nbsp; Well, Daughter, if they really cared about education, then they&#39;d just go ahead and donate the money anyway, wouldn&#39;t they?&amp;nbsp; Why does a multinational corporation need my help to support education?&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re not so much a society anymore as a multi&#45;dimensional marketing cohort.
    Learn to pay attention to the world around you.&amp;nbsp; Observe what your&amp;nbsp;peers are doing and ask yourself,&amp;nbsp;does this make sense?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a wildly difficult concept for most teens, but&amp;nbsp;talking about it helps to&amp;nbsp;lay the groundwork for the future and that&#39;s what this whole process of childrearing is about, preparing them for the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My own father would talk to me about things and in the moment, he&amp;nbsp;sounded as if he were speaking Greek, but it then began to register and things made much more sense.&amp;nbsp; You are, in a sense, planting seeds.
    Make it a point to start telling your child no.

Economic models don&#39;t change immediately and certainly not quietly.&amp;nbsp; But if you can recognize things and at least begin to&amp;nbsp;prepare the kids for the future, they&#39;ll be ahead of the pack when push comes to shove.</body>

<title>Co-ed Sleepovers</title>
<body>This only happened to other people.&amp;nbsp; People who didn&#39;t provide clear guidelines to the kids as they grew and who didn&#39;t pay attention to what was going on.&amp;nbsp; People whose kids obviously didn&#39;t know what they would say on a particular question.&amp;nbsp; And yet, it happened to me and it was stunning.&amp;nbsp; Within a two week span, each of the older kids asked if they could attend a co&#45;ed sleepover.
For the record, most of the comments in the above paragraph are snark although the requests did have me asking them do you honestly think that I would even consider saying yes to this?&amp;nbsp; The reality is that no matter what you do in raising the kids, no matter how clear the expectations and how insistent you are upon those pesky, stupid values thingies, the kids will frequently want to go do something that is contrary to what you believe is right, let alone proper.&amp;nbsp; Coed sleepovers are just one more instance of the ongoing conflict between the family&#39;s values and society&#39;s values.&amp;nbsp;
The separate questions led to a reasoned conversation with one child and a more testy exchange with another who didn&#39;t like the exasperatedly blunt no that came in response to the question.&amp;nbsp; And I admit that I could have handled the question better in the moment.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, why would I say no to such a request, especially since the parents are going to be there?

    Parents are older and at some point, are probably going to sleep and when that happens?&amp;nbsp; Well, gasoline, meet match.&amp;nbsp; Teens in groups are frequently combustible&amp;nbsp;with a noxiously potent stew of testosterone, estrogen and poor judgment and putting a bunch of them in the room together for a prolonged period without supervision is asking for major trouble.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t mean that there will be issues or problems, but it ranks up there with &#45; as PJ O&#39;Rourke once wrote &#45; giving whiskey and car keys to a bunch of teenage boys.&amp;nbsp; Remember, the teen battle cry is What Could Go Wrong?
    Are the parents even going to be there?&amp;nbsp; Teens are exquisitely sensitive to perceptions of parental overinvolvement and any infringement upon their growing independence and will actively discourage any contact between parents, whether because they&#39;re actually plotting or just hate the concept of checking up.&amp;nbsp; There is an active divide and conquer strategy among some teens and it can become unpleasant for parents who override their wishes.&amp;nbsp; That said, I&#39;ve never had a poor exchange with another parent and have actively defended parents who have come to our front door for pickup or dropoff.&amp;nbsp; Four minutes of facetime doesn&#39;t mean that Frank can tell whether I&#39;m an axe murderer, but it does give a decent insight into what&#39;s going on in the household.
    There&#39;s also the question of propriety, the increasingly antiquated noun which the root of (in)appropriate.&amp;nbsp; What does it matter what a bunch of people think of what I do?&amp;nbsp; These are the same people that might be called upon to hire you for a part&#45;time job, write a job or college recommendation or even wonder whether they want you to date their own child in two years.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, it also bears upon my own reputation and I have no intention of placing my reputation in the hands of a tribe of teenagers.&amp;nbsp;
    Everyone does it and besides, almost all of the kids there are either&amp;nbsp;lesbian&amp;nbsp;or gay.&amp;nbsp; Really?&amp;nbsp; And are you lumped into that category by the other kids trying to finagle their folks into agreeing to this?
    Finally, it simply isn&#39;t right.&amp;nbsp; When the kids are adults and on their own, then their actions are their own responsibility and they live with the consequences.&amp;nbsp; But as a parent, I do have a say in what&#39;s considered to be acceptable behavior and letting legally minor children cohabitate, even for one night, isn&#39;t right.

The question hasn&#39;t been raised again but I suspect that it might and once again, it will probably be a tense exchange as the kids test the boundaries and limits.</body>

<title>November PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; The Market Basket Cost Declines</title>
<body>For the second consecutive month since the 47 item market basket peaked in September, 2011, the cost of the market basket actually declined.&amp;nbsp; The November market basket cost was $188.31, down from October&#39;s $188.34 and September&#39;s high of $188.57.
In each month, there are a number of items with price changes, either higher or lower, but what&#39;s notable about the November pricing is that for the first time, the number of items with price decreases was larger than the number with price increases.&amp;nbsp; For the record, 12 items dropped in price versus 11 items with increases; this figure is double October&#39;s finding of only six items with price declines.

<title>Another Look at the Report Card</title>
<body>The marking period is just ended and when the report card comes home from elementary school, I&#39;ll think twice about which segment my eyes run to first &#45; the grades or the social development/class behavior comments.&amp;nbsp; This is on the heels of a conversation that I had with another father as our boys got ready for a Fall baseball game, and the father, Scott, &amp;nbsp;presented me with a viewpoint on an issue that I never truly considered before.
Although the format might differ, almost all elementary schools break out their report cards into two sections.&amp;nbsp; The one section pertains to the grades that were earned while the second covers the social development and behavioral aspects of Junior&#39;s time at school.&amp;nbsp; The teacher usually also provides a brief written synopsis of how Junior&#39;s developing and interacting with the teachers and peers.&amp;nbsp; I can&#39;t speak for other districts, but our elementary report card lists the grades on the left hand side of the page, which are then followed by the development/behavior aspects in the remainder; the teacher&#39;s assessment paragraph is written on a separate sheet of paper.&amp;nbsp; As we read from left to right, and the grades are placed on the left side, they are naturally the first thing to be seen.
Scott&#39;s take on the report card was that he really went right past the grades and focused on the developmental/behavioral aspects of his son&#39;s school experience.&amp;nbsp; In his view, the more important aspect at this level of school was how his son was developing and interacting with his peers; grades certainly mattered, but a poor grade could flow from simply not understanding the material or else from something that was discussed in the development/behavior section.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the former, measures could be taken to help the child understand the material better and bring the grade up.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the latter, then it didn&#39;t matter what you did with assistance and remedial work, but would still require more intentional &#45; and usually more difficult &#45; work on the question of behavior and development.&amp;nbsp; Drilling a kid on the multiplication tables to improve performance is far easier than trying to parse through why Junior behaves a certain way or whether there&#39;s something else coming into play in development.
This viewpoint was simply something that I&#39;ve never considered.&amp;nbsp; Ours is a grades first household &#45; You want to try this?&amp;nbsp; Then show me the grades, first. &#45; and while the other aspects are indeed just as important, they were something that I went to after I&#39;d satisfied myself that the grades were in order.&amp;nbsp; The father has a legitimate point in his comments.&amp;nbsp; Grades are frequently symptoms of a deeper, underlying issue and even if the immediate issue of the grade is corrected, the developmental side can fester until it erupts much later if it isn&#39;t addressed early.
When the report card comes out of the backpack in about a week, I&#39;ll be remembering his comments before I read the report.

<title>Reading with the Kids - When Do I Stop?</title>
<body>Experts say that you should start reading with the kids when they&#39;re very young, but when are we supposed to stop?
The benefits to children of reading with them are manifold.&amp;nbsp; From the earliest age &#45; and my wife and I read to ours from the earliest days &#45; the child learns much.&amp;nbsp; At first, the child learns to listen to the cadence, tone and inflection to assist them as they themselves learn to speak, even from learning the most basic sounds.&amp;nbsp; As they grow and begin to master the various sounds, their brains can start to follow basic concepts that might be found in very simple books, such as shapes, colors, animals, textures and trucks.&amp;nbsp; Hold a child in your lap with a cardboard book with easy&#45;to&#45;manipulate pages and the child can even start to get in some manual dexterity practice as she improves at grasping and turning the pages.&amp;nbsp; By the time that they&#39;re in preschool, you&#39;re off to the races with stories that not only feed their imagination, but help them with practical skills such as learning how to sit and listen for a short period of time; as they age, the skill increases and enhances their ability to concentrate for longer periods also.
With the first two children, it was simple as they were only about two years apart and by the time that they were in early elementary school, they&#39;d heard stories such as Peter Pan, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Hobbit&amp;nbsp; and A Christmas Carol.&amp;nbsp; Each has since moved on to their own preferred genres and are now fully into adult fiction; Eldest loves chick lit and Middle prefers F Paul Wilson&#39;s Repairman Jack.&amp;nbsp;
But it&#39;s been far more sporadic and intermittent with Youngest, who&#39;s still in Elementary School and whose reading times have been greatly affected by the general uproar that comes with active older siblings.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s an advanced reader and unlike his elder siblings, prefers non&#45;fiction and science to the fiction realm, which makes it difficult to stay awake in the evening hours while reading with him.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, alligators and gecko lizards put me to sleep.&amp;nbsp; His technical skills haven&#39;t suffered in the least and the verbal acuity has only been brought even further along by trying to keep up with precocious siblings; I was appalled to discover last week that he&#39;s even been introduced to Urban Dictionary, although I&#39;m unclear if that&#39;s courtesy of Middle or someone from elementary school.&amp;nbsp; Youngest however, still wants to read with me and while it does crimp into the evening hours and activities, it&#39;s something to which I look forward.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not even about story anymore, although it certainly makes a difference.&amp;nbsp; Instead, it&#39;s about spending some quiet moments alone with one another and enjoying something together.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had to learn to decide in advance what I&#39;d like to introduce and do so in enough time to make it timely.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, we began Ray Bradbury&#39;s The Halloween Tree&amp;nbsp;in the latter part of September and finished it a week before Halloween itself.&amp;nbsp; While Youngest has pulled out Joshua Mowll&#39;s Operation Red Jericho&amp;nbsp;and we&#39;ve begun that, my intent is to finish it as quickly as possible so that we can introduce him to Dickens&#39; A Christmas Carol.
The time is coming when he&#39;ll outstrip the desire and choice of literature as did his siblings and reading with Dad will go the route of toy soldiers and teddy bears, and as my own father said that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.&amp;nbsp; But he&#39;s still got the desire and amidst all of the general hoopla, I&#39;ve realized that these are moments that I&#39;ve got to grab onto with both hands because the days are dwindling fast.&amp;nbsp; So after Halloween tonight, we&#39;ll come back and split out the candy and after he&#39;s ready for bed, we&#39;ll curl up with the Guild Specialists of Operation Red Jericho.
And while I&#39;m thinking about it, perhaps I&#39;ll yank out my old tape recording of Orson Welles&#39; War of the Worlds broadcast and we&#39;ll curl up to the Martians landing at Red Hook, New Jersey.</body>

<title>Student Lending Modifications:&nbsp; Hey, It&#8217;s a Start&#8230;</title>
<body>...but only that.
The word is out that the President will be announcing executive orders to assist college students and graduates who are mired in debt.&amp;nbsp; The changes, which accelerate congressional actions, are threefold:

    The maximum repayment is to be capped at 10% of income instead of the present 15%;
    Any debt remaining will be forgiven after 20 years instead of the present 25 year period;
    Loans from two existing programs will be consolidated at a rate approximately .5% lower than it currently is.

The expectation is that the changes will apply to approximately 7.5 million people with individual savings of about &amp;quot;several hundred dollars&amp;quot; monthly.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s do a back&#45;of&#45;the&#45;envelope exercise to ascertain the effect here.&amp;nbsp; Assume that there are 7.5 million affected with an average monthly savings of $300, or $3600 annually.&amp;nbsp; The total annual savings are in the vicinity of $27 billion (7.5M @ $3600), which is less than 3% of the approximately $1 T owed for higher education.
It&#39;s a start, but it amounts to tinkering with the machinery.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t go to the root issues that face our youngsters.&amp;nbsp; First, that the rate of inflation for tuition continues to rise at a clip disproportionate to the overall CPI and is now far more outsized to the average family income than it was several decades ago.&amp;nbsp; Second, it doesn&#39;t address the fact that there are simply very few sustainable, living wage jobs for graduates.&amp;nbsp; Until these core issues are addressed, either by the market or the government via some workable, commonsense policy, then the kids are going to continue to face difficulties that force them to postpone their true adult lives, out of the nest and on their own.</body>

<title>College:&nbsp; The Degree or the Experience?</title>
<body>When you go places overnight with the kids, you often have the opportunity to kibbitz and share perspectives with other parents in similar situations and such was the case the other night.&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the question batted around was whether the actual degree, that almost&#45;magical parchment for which millions of students and parents&amp;nbsp;impoverish themselves, was more or less important than the college experience itself.&amp;nbsp;
The conversation was with a woman for whom I have considerable respect.&amp;nbsp; Her eldest child is enrolled at a prestigious national liberal arts university and has a significant merit scholarship; that said, the scholarship doesn&#39;t cover even half of the annual tuition/room and board and it&#39;s up to the folks to carry the load on this.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s a person who &#45; along with her husband &#45; has done a terrific job of raising the kids and assuring that they have opportunities to broaden their horizons.&amp;nbsp; The two kids clearly have been raised with expectations, rules and accountability and they are, in simple terms, truly a good couple of kids.&amp;nbsp; As we talked, her clear sense was that while the degree matters, what truly matters is that kids take full advantage of the college experience.&amp;nbsp; Travel abroad, unique courses, top quality faculty and&amp;nbsp;students of the same caliber and apprecation of education are crucial and worthy of the cost involved if the student takes full advantage of them.&amp;nbsp; This is the message from parent to student and God love &#39;em, the folks are moving heaven and earth to make it happen.&amp;nbsp; To her credit, the student in question is likewise taking advantage of the opportunities provided to her by her folks&#39; sacrifice.
My&amp;nbsp;comments could be categorized as respectful disagreement.&amp;nbsp; I was fortunate to grow up in a time when, while a private university was still expensive compared to public institutions, it had not become wholly disproportionate to the typical income of the time and I acknowledge that.&amp;nbsp; My comments ran along the lines that the times and the model have changed in the intervening thirty years.&amp;nbsp; The costs are disproportionately higher as the tuition/room and board inflation rate have risen at a rate higher than the standard CPI &#45; assuming that you don&#39;t believe that that number is gamed anyways &#45; and the average family income is now down several percentage points from four years ago.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, higher education is no longer the realm of ivy&#45;covered non&#45;profits with memorable fight songs and old buildings.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a big business &#45; which one blog commenter refers to as Big Ed &#45; in which almost two dozen college presidents receive wage packages in excess of $1 million; the primary funding institution, Sallie Mae, by all appearances is a fiefdom&amp;nbsp;unto itself with it&#39;s own collection agency and a lobbying budget that has surpassed a million dollars annually.&amp;nbsp; If a nobleman has men&#45;at&#45;arms to collect the peons&#39; taxes and ingratiates himself with the king to maintain good relations and access, then the nobleman by definition has a fiefdom.&amp;nbsp;
Perhaps the greatest damage to the argument has been the issue of the non&#45;dischargeable college debt, which figures in Occupy Wall Street&#39;s 99 Percent Declaration.&amp;nbsp; While we&#39;ve outsourced our living&#45;wage jobs and manufacturing base, we&#39;re made it damned near impossible for the new crop of students coming out as they&#39;ve bought into the dream and mortgaged themselves to do it, only to be told by the way, that degree gets you a barista position with no benefits.&amp;nbsp; In the conversation noted above, the young woman will probably come out with no debt courtesy of her parents, who in turn will be most likely laden to the hilt.&amp;nbsp; The student debt issue won&#39;t apply since they&#39;ll have the debt, but it begs the question of what precisely we, as parents, owe our children.&amp;nbsp; Do we owe them our own future in order for them to have the experience?&amp;nbsp; The conversation in my own home recently contained the comment that we owe you an education, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we have to bankrupt ourselves (and for the record, the child isn&#39;t asking us to do so).&amp;nbsp; We have to take the adult long view and consider who&#39;s coming up later in the family pipeline, as well as our own old age needs.&amp;nbsp; Both my wife and I are&amp;nbsp;grateful that at the same time that college is on the plate, we&#39;re not also forced to throw additional financial resources at helping our own parents on the other slice of the sandwich bread.&amp;nbsp; While I hope that things improve, I&#39;m confident that this is all part and parcel of a permanent ratcheting downwards in the national economy and if that&#39;s the case, then Eldest and her younger siblings will have their hands full caring for their own future broods.&amp;nbsp; When I&#39;m in my dotage is likely to be the worst time for them to have to assist financially in terms of their own economic and financial lives.
Some might view my friend&#39;s beliefs as too idealistic and lacking in common sense.&amp;nbsp; Others might see me as a raging ass who&#39;s so selfish that he&#39;ll take experiences from his kids&#39; mouths for sake of a dime.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s important in this is what you consider.&amp;nbsp; What do you owe your children and how far does that extend?&amp;nbsp; If you won&#39;t pay for &amp;quot;the experience&amp;quot;, what will you do to offset that?&amp;nbsp; Will you make a similar investment in your time and talent that these other parents have done?&amp;nbsp; Look down the road a distance and even consider what you think is on the horizon.
These are valid questions and ones that should be considered and debated when the kids are younger and before you&#39;re forced into a values decision that you might come to regret.</body>

<title>The Explosion of Student Debt</title>
<body>With Eldest in the midst of the college search, we&#39;re exquisitely aware of the college costs and how her choices impact the issue of debt &#45; and vice versa.&amp;nbsp; So it was eye&#45;opening to see how student debt doubled in little over a decade&amp;nbsp;and actually rose by $100 Billion in one year alone.&amp;nbsp; As many Americans with jobs cut back on their spending and credit card debt, our youngsters are being forced to take on increasing amounts of debt to earn what is the 21st century&#39;s equivalent of the high school diploma.
Our goal is to have our daughter come out of college with no debt and we&#39;ve saved enough over the years to make that happen under certain circumstances and we&#39;ve shared those circumstances with her for the past several years; God love her, she&#39;s taken the conversations to heart and studied to academically achieve what I never could have.&amp;nbsp; The difficulty is that there are plenty of other academically capable seniors also out there, competing against one another for the grants and scholarships that are probably stagnant in their own growth because of the lack of any real returns on the funds in their endowments.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s hard to restock the larder when you&#39;re bound by fiduciary requirements and the only real returns today seem to come from a big win in the Powerball.
So what are the various options to help the kids, apart from saving on your own?

    Find out what the graduation requirements are for high school as soon as they&#39;re freshmen and lay out in advance what the various routes and alternative paths are.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t assume that the high school counselors are going to magically assure that everything&#39;s done and set for your kid.&amp;nbsp; Late this summer, we found out that while Eldest needed another course in English to graduate, the school enrolled her in yet another History course instead; if we hadn&#39;t kept up with it, she&#39;d been in the position of having to jury rig some weird second&#45;semester combination just to graduate from high school with greater than a 4.0 average.
    Investigate if any neighboring community colleges or state universities allow capable high school students to take coursework there.&amp;nbsp; If so, then talk to the high school counselors and administration about what high school courses can be replaced by the college courses instead.&amp;nbsp; Some high schools permit this &#45; as ours does &#45; and the students get a three&#45;fer on the deal.&amp;nbsp; The high school provides credit towards graduation, most colleges and universities will accept the credits on the lower level courses after the student graduates from high school, and the college courses bolster the high school grade point average.&amp;nbsp; For instance, a high school might weight a college prep course with&amp;nbsp;three credits, an honors class with&amp;nbsp;four credits and a college course with five credits; this is how there high school graduates coming out with GPAs of 4.1 and above.&amp;nbsp; The other advantage to this is that there&#39;s greater up front cost, but it can be handled in much smaller bites over a longer period of time as the courses are gradually completed over two years and you aren&#39;t left with some whopping large bill later on.&amp;nbsp; In Eldest&#39;s case, she&#39;ll graduate high school with a full semester of college credits already under her belt.
    Assure that the kids have a real sense of what the greater wide world is like.&amp;nbsp; Come Junior and Senior year of high school, they&#39;ll be pelted with glossy brochures extolling the virtues of Dear Ol&#39; Wassamatta U, ripe with pictures of smiling young adults, none of whom seem to be half&#45;naked or hungover.&amp;nbsp; While the large majority of them want independence and to be away from the soul&#45;crushing atmosphere of the parents, they also don&#39;t want to pay attention to the world around them so that they come into the real world as startled and screaming as the day that they were born.&amp;nbsp; In a sense, the youngsters protesting at OWS are being brought kicking and screaming into a world in which they&#39;ve been not only dropped on their heads at birth, but used as financial hackisacks by the staff on cigarette breaks.&amp;nbsp; What does this mean on a practical level?&amp;nbsp; From high school freshman year, when the grades really do start to count for the college experience, show them what&#39;s been saved so far &#45; if any has been saved.&amp;nbsp; Explain to them where it&#39;s at and while $5000 might seem like a lot to a 14 year old with no sense of proportion, then take them to the website for the nearest state university and contrast that with the cost of a semester there.&amp;nbsp; Over the years, continue talking to them about the necessity of a degree and as they age, bring in the concept of wages so that they can start to understand the idea of debtload.&amp;nbsp; In Eldest&#39;s case, she discovered what a 529 plan was during the spring of her Freshman year and is now fully aware of what&#39;s been saved for her versus what the various alternatives cost.&amp;nbsp; Middle has already had this same conversation even earlier than his older sibling and even Youngest &#45; in elementary school &#45; is aware of the generalities if not the specifics.
    Take the time &#45; years in advance, if necessary &#45; to find out what the various mechanisms and opportunities are out there.&amp;nbsp; Explore college scholarship websites, follow up with the guidance counselors and keep tab on what the kids are thinking so that you&#39;re not unduly scrambling in the few months between the end of junior year and the start of the application deadlines.&amp;nbsp; Even then, it&#39;s a daunting process.
    Talk to the kids, persistently and consistently on message.&amp;nbsp; There will come a point when they roll their eyes&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;try to defer and avoid hearing it, but the truth is that they do listen to what&#39;s being said.&amp;nbsp;

Eldest is winnowing down the field of alternatives as she mosies through the process.&amp;nbsp; There have been moments when I&#39;ve hated having to point things out to her because I don&#39;t want to intrude on what should be fun years, but those moments of discomfort are offset by the knowledge that there is at least some semblance of an informed decision.&amp;nbsp; While I have no idea where she&#39;ll wind up or even if there&#39;s going to be some debt afterwards, it&#39;s become clear that she&#39;s taken the conversations of the past several years to heart.
Keep talking, they&#39;re listening.

<title>Occupy Wall Street&#8217;s Declaration</title>
<body>For those who are interested, here is a link&amp;nbsp;to the declaration issued several days ago by the Occupy Wall Street Working Group.
For all that the Main Street Media is doing to paint them as wackos, screwups, babes&#45;in&#45;the&#45;woods and malcontents, the declaration provides substantive and eye&#45;opening reading.&amp;nbsp; The goals are ambitious and direct, even if messy in the sausage&#45;making aspect of politics when and if they come about.&amp;nbsp; Boiled down to the bare&#45;bones essentials, the gist is this:

    Our nation is squandering its resources on foreign adventurism and non&#45;renewable energy, replacing active measures of research and application with a steady stream of military spending;
    Our nation is failing to look to the future by saddling its young people with non&#45;dischargeable debt, yet failing to promote policies and industries that provide them with the wherewithal to retire the debt and make a reasonable wage;
    Our nation is committing political and social suicide by permitting a very small minority of people to control a wildly disproportionate measure of the national wealth;
    Our nation&#39;s government is actively abetting this since it has been financially coopted by that very small minority who have prospered.

While the term fascist been lobbed about like a verbal hand&#45;grenade over the past five decades, the Working Group is absolutely correct in their opening quote by Benito Mussolini &#45; Who?&amp;nbsp; Oh yeah, the Italian dude who was buddies with Hitler during the Second World War, you know, the one right after the Civil War&amp;nbsp;&#45; that fascism is a combination of big government and big business.
I suggest that you read it, even if you prefer the Tea Party over the young punks screaming, chanting and beating drums on Wall Street.&amp;nbsp; You might be surprised to&amp;nbsp;find yourself nodding your head.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; What&#8217;s My Line?</title>
<body>One of my peeves is that our kids have such a lousy handle on history &#45; hell, most of us have a lousy handle on it &#45; and we don&#39;t recognize that history &amp;quot;doesn&#39;t repeat itself, but it does rhyme&amp;quot; because human nature doesn&#39;t change.&amp;nbsp; In its own way, the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street are simply two sides of the same nickel that&#39;s been reminted from it&#39;s original design 200 years ago.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s apparent from reading multiple sources &#45; and hearing others, like Hannity, LImbaugh, etc &#45; that the work is on to paint these protestors as wackos, malcontents and screwups who can&#39;t get or hold a job, conspiracy theorists who blame others for their own predicament, or professional political activists who&#39;ve now latched onto a new cause that sucks in all of the unwitting dupes just mentioned above.
History doesn&#39;t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.
That said, feel free to see if you can correctly identify who stated each of the quotes or passages that follow.
1.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;There are never wanting some persons of violent and undertaking natures, who, so they may have power and business, will take it at any cost.&amp;quot;
(a)&amp;nbsp; Friedrich Engel
(b)&amp;nbsp; Sir Francis Bacon
(c)&amp;nbsp; Franklin Delano Roosevelt
(d)&amp;nbsp; Theodore Roosevelt
2.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.&amp;nbsp; To destroy the invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of statesmanship of the day.&amp;quot;
(a)&amp;nbsp; Theodore Roosevelt
(b)&amp;nbsp; Karl Marx
(c)&amp;nbsp; Michael Moore, director/activist
(d)&amp;nbsp; Gov. Jerry Brown
3.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;A great industrial nation is controlled by it&#39;s system of credit.&amp;nbsp; Our system of credit is concentrated in the hands of a few men.&amp;nbsp; We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and&amp;nbsp;dominated governments in the world &#45; no longer a government of free&amp;nbsp;opinion, no longer a government by conviction and&amp;nbsp;vote of the majority,&amp;nbsp;but a government by the opinion and duress of small groups of dominant men.&amp;quot;
(a)&amp;nbsp; Rep. Ron Paul (TX)
(b)&amp;nbsp; Matt Taibbi, journalist
(c)&amp;nbsp; Arianna Huffington
(d)&amp;nbsp; Woodrow Wilson
4.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all commerce and industry.&amp;quot;
(a)&amp;nbsp; Robert Reich
(b)&amp;nbsp; Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
(c)&amp;nbsp; Financier George Soros
(d)&amp;nbsp; James Garfield, US President (1880 &#45; 1882)
5.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;History records that the money changers have used every form of abuse, intrigue, deceit, and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and it&#39;s issuance.&amp;quot;
(a)&amp;nbsp; James Madison
(b)&amp;nbsp; Senator Bernie Sanders (VT)
(c)&amp;nbsp; Vladimir Ilych Lenin
(d)&amp;nbsp; Bill Maher, comedian
And the answers are...
1.&amp;nbsp; (b)&amp;nbsp; Sir Francis Bacon (1561 &#45; 1626)
2.&amp;nbsp; (a)&amp;nbsp; Theodore Roosevelt, US President who was the first to actively wield the Sherman Anti&#45;Trust Act to gain control over the industrial combines of the late 19th/early 20th centuries.
3.&amp;nbsp; (d)&amp;nbsp; Woodrow Wilson, US President who promoted the adoption of the legislation establishing the Federal Reserve System in 1913.&amp;nbsp; He later rued his actions for this legislation.
4.&amp;nbsp; (d)&amp;nbsp; James Garfield, US President (1881), who was heavily involved in the debates over the nature of the American currency after the Civil War.
5.&amp;nbsp; (a)&amp;nbsp; James Madison, US President and writer of the Constitution, who was engaged in the debate over the establishment of the First Bank of the United States.&amp;nbsp;
Think twice &#45; even three times &#45; when you read, watch or listen to the media.&amp;nbsp; Both OWS and the Tea Party are two sides of the same coin, one minted in dissatisfaction, disaffection and distrust of the corporate and political establishment; an establishment that is really now joined at the hip like&amp;nbsp;a pair of freakishly bloated Siamese twins grabbing food from the plates of others and cramming it into&amp;nbsp;one another&#39;s&amp;nbsp;mouths.&amp;nbsp; The fear and concern is genuine and is a natural occurrence to what&#39;s clearly seen as the usurpation and corruption of the system&amp;nbsp;for the benefit of a very, very select few.&amp;nbsp;
This has happened before and my hope is that it&#39;s corrected so that it can happen again in another hundred or so years.&amp;nbsp; When you see members of Generation Y yelling in the streets and middle class oldsters sitting with tea bags dangling from fishing caps, ask yourself what Madison, Garfield, Roosevelt and Wilson would say and do and while you&#39;re at it, throw in FDR, Jefferson and Jackson as well.

<title>First Hand Look at the Tiger Mother</title>
<body>There are stereotypes borne of reality and one of these is of the chinese mother, as popularly memorialized by Amy Chua in her 2011 bestseller, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s one thing to read it but another thing entirely to get a first&#45;hand insight into the thinking of the Tiger Mother; it was something that I received the other week when I gave a lift to the Tiger Mother&#39;s daughter and she, my daughter and I had an illuminating conversation.
In Chua&#39;s book, she decides to raise her two Chinese&#45;American/Jewish daughters in the Chinese manner.&amp;nbsp; The child is given real opportunities but the quid pro quo is that the child is expected to perform and do so in exemplary fashion.&amp;nbsp; Practicing for violin lessons during vacation?&amp;nbsp; Check.&amp;nbsp; Repeated drilling of lessons?&amp;nbsp; Check.&amp;nbsp; While I consider my wife and I to be fairly hardnosed about expectations of children, I couldn&#39;t conceive of demanding such from my own kids.&amp;nbsp; My own general guidelines of the kids are to do your best, respect your teachers and coaches, and don&#39;t ever waste my time.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t want to practice for the music lessons that you requested?&amp;nbsp; Fine, learn to play the damned thing on your own.&amp;nbsp; In an earlier article, my thought was that this general attitude arose from living in an unstable society where there few opportunities and those only went to those who were the absolute best.&amp;nbsp; China has had longer periods of economic and political instability longer than this country has been a republic and if parents want the best for their children, they&#39;ll provide it by pushing the kids to be able to survive in that society.
In this particular conversation, Tiger Mother&#39;s Daughter &#45; hereafter referred to as TMD &#45; was asking about health insurance and pension plans; bear in mind that this is a 17 year&#45;old.&amp;nbsp; When she mentioned pension plans, my mental response was akin to bwahahahahahahahahahaha*snort* but I answered her in a matter&#45;of&#45;fact way.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, very few companies still offer pension plans anymore.&amp;nbsp; If people want to retire, then they&#39;ll have to save it for themselves in some plan such as an IRA or 401k and I wouldn&#39;t hold your breath trying to find that kind of company anymore.&amp;nbsp; Ironically, I thought, those few who do still have pension plans can probably offer them to the administrative staff since they&#39;ve outsourced all of the labor to China.&amp;nbsp; Her plans involved some form of engineering, perhaps for the military, since her SAT math scores were higher than I can count and I confirmed that yes, the military did offer a pension for years of service.&amp;nbsp; The flip side is that our spending is so out of whack that the military is probably going to take some real budget hits, so you have to be aware of that.&amp;nbsp; To her credit, her own thinking was that she could go the business school route and there&#39;s where I responded with a Ding*Ding*Ding inflection in my voice.&amp;nbsp; With your abilities, grades and language skills, yeah, you&#39;d be snapped up.
It was in this conversation that I could hear the mother&#39;s fears and motivations come through.&amp;nbsp; They were immigrants and while that&#39;s tough for everyone, she was shielding her daughter from the true unpleasantries that come with parenting and adulthood in such a situation.&amp;nbsp; I could discern her thinking please, I don&#39;t want her to hate the surroundings in which she might have to raise her own child; I don&#39;t want her to wonder about where the food&#39;s going to come from; I want my grandchild to have better than I could give you, my love.
In terms of family structure and child&#45;rearing, the Chinese are almost in a completely different dimension from the typical American family.&amp;nbsp; We view them as comical absurdities in their demands of their kids and the responses when the kids do stupid things &#45; and boy, kids will do stupid things.&amp;nbsp; But getting even a tiny glimpse into that world is eye&#45;opening and that&#39;s even for someone who&#39;s already considered by the kids to be pretty hardnosed.&amp;nbsp; Given what this country has already been through economically and I expect will go through in the near future, I&#39;m appreciating the demands placed a bit more than I did before.</body>

<title>Emotions and Reason in the College Search</title>
<body>It&#39;s one thing to be aware of a problem like the issue of student debt, and even to write about it rationally.&amp;nbsp; But when the kids actually begin the college search process and are engaged in it, that rationality can really become endangered and that&#39;s not just on the part of the kid.&amp;nbsp; The emotions &#45; and guilt &#45; swirl about and cloud the decision&#45;making better than a lawyer sniffing a settlement.
Eldest is in the heart of the process now and as I write this, is on the road returning from an overnight visit to a private college.&amp;nbsp; This is the third overnight experience that she&#39;s had along with two standard visits and interviews and there&#39;s still another to come in about three weeks before she winnows her choices down the select few.&amp;nbsp; At each visit, the effort is made to pair the prospective students with the most engaging &amp;quot;ambassadors&amp;quot; who put the best face on the institution and sell it to the max.&amp;nbsp; Throw enough students at this particular marketing wall and a few are going to stick and opt for that college.
This is a highly emotional, well&#45;spun process and it can cause almost anybody to lose sight of the salient facts.&amp;nbsp; Students talk about the experience and look for the best &amp;quot;fit&amp;quot;, gauging whether the physical reality seems to mesh with the glossy, crisp photos of smiling students amidst plush facilities and noshing at yogurt bars.&amp;nbsp; As I write this, a brochure from Wisconsin Lutheran College is at my right and there are various photos of students in a diverse series of activities below a large photo of color&#45;clad trees, apparently in that one week period between summer and the onset of northern mid&#45;west blizzards.&amp;nbsp; The interior is filled with quotes and captioned photos of the faculty and students and is solely intended to sell the emotions; in this regard, Higher Ed is no different from the &amp;quot;Home&amp;quot;builders, who always mention that they&#39;re selling homes instead of houses.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, there&#39;s also been correspondence to the us, the parents, reassuring us that they also only want what&#39;s in our child&#39;s best interest and oh yes, by the way, this is an investment in their future.
And the eighteen years that we&#39;ve spent so far is...what?
Reason meets emotion amidst our conversations.&amp;nbsp; Eldest is deeply aware of the debt situation and doesn&#39;t want to mortgage her future.&amp;nbsp; We want her to enjoy the college &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot; and naturally want what&#39;s best for her.&amp;nbsp; But certain phrases crop up, such as best fit and experience &#45; which is naturally the one that&#39;s displayed in the brochures and online.&amp;nbsp; The guilt is there &#45; did we save enough and could we have saved more?&amp;nbsp; Yes, there might have to be some debt, but are we betting against our child when we seriously consider some of the more highly priced options?&amp;nbsp; After all, there&#39;s always a crying need for a good lawyer, dentist, fireman, photographer and isn&#39;t she the one that could get through it?&amp;nbsp; Our talks work through this process as best fit is paired off against debtload and the point is reiterated that the final decision among decent options will most likely come down to the financial package as I try to shove aside the emotional baggage that I carry.&amp;nbsp; To her credit, Eldest &#45; a rocket scientist who will have finished 15 credits of college coursework by her high school graduation &#45; has culled out the majority of the highly priced private colleges except for one with a screamingly good program in which her interests lie.
As I struggle with cynicism, I then get a cold dose of reality from this infographic explanation&amp;nbsp;about the student lending system.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that student loans were ruled as non&#45;dischargeable in the first place as graduates in the 1970s scammed the system by declaring bankruptcy upon graduation and dodging repayment.&amp;nbsp; With loss rates rising, the systemic response was understandable.&amp;nbsp; Yet some very smart &#45; and not terribly moral &#45; people understood their advantage and built a system around it to secure their particular little empire.&amp;nbsp; When an agency like Sallie Mae owns its own collection agency and spends millions in lobbying, they&#39;ve got themselves an empire.&amp;nbsp; Bang!&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m all the way back to my hardnosed stance.&amp;nbsp;
Blow away all of the smoke and the salient facts are these.

    A college degree does matter.&amp;nbsp; It is the 21st century equivalent of the high school diploma and it does make an economic difference.
    If it makes a hard economic difference, then the final decision has to be based principally upon the hard economics of the decision.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the cost and what&#39;s the aid package?&amp;nbsp; Whether Dear Ol&#39; Wassamatta U has a primo yogurt bar or Mongolian Grill is irrelevant and that must be pointed out to the kid.
    While debt is a personal bugaboo, reasonable debt is a tool provided that the job prospects for the career support the ability to repay the debt.&amp;nbsp;
    In today&#39;s economy &#45; depressed, recessed, generally suckish, whatever you wish to call it&amp;nbsp;&#45; the jobs available to manage that debt are simply not available.&amp;nbsp; If you have any doubt, just consider all the adults doing jobs previously held by our teenagers.
    College is only three or four years of an actuarially long lifespan.&amp;nbsp; Does it make sense to mortgage the next ten to fifteen years for those few?
    What you get out of something is wholly dependent upon what is put into it.

The college search will continue and I truly have no clue where she&#39;ll go.&amp;nbsp; My great wish however, is that whatever college is finally chosen has the best program for the money that&#39;s available.&amp;nbsp; And then we&#39;ll start going to work on child number two as we take up the bean diet.

<category>Family Management</category>
<title>Food, Family, Shift Dining, Vegetarians and Budgets</title>
<body>With college on the horizon for Eldest, followed in intervals by Middle and Youngest, the question is how to cut down on one of our biggest expenditures &#45; food.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a puzzle since it&#39;s one thing to say oh yeah, I&#39;ll cook for the family but it&#39;s another thing completely when the other factors are the chaotic scheduling due to three different kids with activities and the presence of a vegetarian in the household.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s now a reality that the traditional family meal is the exception to the rule and it would be easy to just pop a precooked meal, a la Stouffer&#39;s in the oven.&amp;nbsp; But time truly is money and the cost is truly lessened if it&#39;s cooked.
This will be an ongoing project to cut down on the food spending while still meeting my primary constraints:

    Creating a decently cooked meal that can be easily heated/reheated for the various kids and spouse who are constrained by schedules;
    Creating a meal that, while requiring some investment in the initial preparation, won&#39;t take significant reheat times since I&#39;m the one providing much of the transportation;
    Creating a meal that tries to honor Eldest&#39;s dietary choice of being a vegetarian (actually an ovopescavegetarian since she will eat eggs and fish;
    Creating a meal that uses fresher and easily obtainable ingredients to cut down on the costs.

And yes, I&#39;m going to walk through the scheduling and thinking as I outline what I&#39;ll be doing regularly.
Today&#39;s situation was work for Eldest, theatre practice for Middle and an undetermined return for Better Half.&amp;nbsp; The kicker however, is that the following night consists of either work or activities for everybody and on top of that, I&#39;m gone as well so whatever is prepared today has to be easily reheated by various folks at different times before they exit.&amp;nbsp; Since soup is something that almost always improves in taste with time, the choice was soup.&amp;nbsp; On the island was a butternut squash and there were plenty of Gala, Honeycrisp and Fuji apples in the garage so a quick review of the internet led to this 12 serving recipe for Roasted Butternut Squash Soup with Apples and Bacon.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, there&#39;s a vegetarian in the house but&amp;nbsp;there are occasions when I&#39;m asking for a little flexibility; our own menu has largely shifted out of chicken and red meat since the dietary change occurred so a little bacon is alright on the rare instance.&amp;nbsp; Since I was also already cutting up an apple for the soup, I went ahead and sliced extra and threw them into the crockpot to cook on high for several hours.&amp;nbsp; The complement to the meal would be simply bread with butter.
Given that I already had all of the ingredients in the house, it was an exceptionally inexpensive meal for what&#39;s turning out to be two nights of food.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Keep Talking, They&#8217;re Listening.&nbsp; But What Do the Youngest Understand?</title>
<body>We all know the phrases:&amp;nbsp; ...like talkin&#39; to a brick wall; they see me movin&#39; my lips and nod just to humor me;&amp;nbsp; does anybody even understand a word that I say?&amp;nbsp; Talking to teens can be an immensely frustrating exercise as their egos and hormone&#45;addled brains seemingly overwhelm the message of what you&#39;re trying to get across.&amp;nbsp; Ask them several minutes later what you were saying and you&#39;re liable to get a cocked&#45;head impersonation of Laddie, the wonder Spaniel.&amp;nbsp; But there are moments when you realize that someone really is listening and it&#39;s not always the teens, but the younger ones who hear what&#39;s being said and then process it in interesting and occasionally sad manners.
This was the case with Youngest, who&#39;s still in elementary school and hears the conversations with Eldest, who&#39;s progressing on the college search.&amp;nbsp; In the course of conversations, he&#39;s learned about 529 plans, scholarships and such a thing as a SAGE account.&amp;nbsp; He understands and God love him, has taken the academic discipline to heart as he faithfully keeps up with the homework without prodding and little complaint.&amp;nbsp; But I was surprised by a recent conversation with him about this distant, post&#45;high school event on the horizon.&amp;nbsp; Youngest knows that a young neighbor recently left for the Air Force and was suddenly talking about plans to enlist when he turned 18; many boys talk about joining the army or marines as though it&#39;s a grand continuation of their childhood soldier games, but Youngest spoke with a considerably different bent.&amp;nbsp; This was laying out a plan to spend several years in uniform and then a return to civilian life to pursue studies under the college benefits plans.&amp;nbsp; While this is certainly a possibility, it&#39;s generally bandied about by much older teens and when I reminded him that we were saving for him as well, he responded to the effect that we also had his older siblings to cover and besides, we would then be approaching the years when people are starting to actively consider retirement.&amp;nbsp; What would be available to him would likely be minimal as the well would be dry (my words, not his).
I would have been less surprised to hear him uttering obscenities that he might have picked up on the Howard Stern Show.&amp;nbsp;
It could be considered an isolated situation save for another conversation with a very close friend, who related that her youngest son had spent considerable time and thought on the same issue.&amp;nbsp; The folks are talking with my sister about how to handle college and how she&#39;s really going to have to work to help with scholarships and grants since there isn&#39;t enough saved.&amp;nbsp; Geez, Dad&#39;s getting old and when I get there, he and Mom are gonna be way more tired.&amp;nbsp; The education is really necessary and how am I gonna handle this?&amp;nbsp; It then sank in that someone really was listening to what was being said to his older siblings.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t have the base of knowledge or experience to be able to process it properly and was quietly going about his way to handle it as best as he might be able.&amp;nbsp; In that moment, my eyes teared and I almost wept.
The upshot is this.&amp;nbsp; Keep talking, even when you think that you&#39;re absolutely beating your bloody head to a pulp and the kids are making jokes about it.&amp;nbsp; The politicians call it staying on message and while they all are skewered by Leno, Letterman and Stewart, the truly successful politicians do exactly that.&amp;nbsp; The message gets across and the lessons are &#45; in most cases &#45; driven home to the listeners.&amp;nbsp; But as you repeat the message again and again, take a moment to consider what I didn&#39;t, that there are younger ears listening and taking what&#39;s being said to heart.&amp;nbsp; When you have the opportunity, pull that youngster aside and ask what he thinks that he&#39;s heard and if there&#39;s a discrepancy, take that moment to reassure him that he&#39;s neither alone nor left as the leftover child forced to fend for himself after the older kids have sucked the nest dry and moved onwards.
And even when the teens give you the Spaniel treatment, understand that they&amp;nbsp;are listening, too.&amp;nbsp; Keep talking.

<title>Occupy Wall Street:&nbsp; What Do They Want?</title>
<body>The media question right now is what does &amp;quot;Occupy Wall Street&amp;quot; really want?&amp;nbsp; The media visiting see all manner of signs and wonder what the protestors want; what are the demands?&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re belittled by many pundits such as Hannity and Coulter, who stated that they need to get a job, take a shower and move on.&amp;nbsp; What truly motivates them apart from envy of what the successful have accomplished?&amp;nbsp; My own mother &#45; a solid Fox News viewer &#45; stated her dislike of them and was taken aback when I not only tried to explain the movement, but actually&amp;nbsp;vented on her.&amp;nbsp;
What&#39;s&amp;nbsp;driving this?&amp;nbsp; Let me paraphrase my vent.
After a decades long binge, the occupants of&amp;nbsp;neighborhood America are awakening to find that their vicinity has been trashed.&amp;nbsp; A potent mix of &#39;shroom and grain laced Kool Aid was prepared and handed out and many drank, some much more than others.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The music&amp;nbsp;was crashingly loud and the lyrics were slick:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You can have it all; You have to do what&#39;s right for you;&amp;nbsp;more is better and there&#39;s no reason that you should feel bad; Don&#39;t worry, someone else will&amp;nbsp;fix it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In the course of this national debauch, we neglected our infrastructure, spent our money on the crap that was peddled to us &#45; hell, we made a folk hero out of a chamois pimp &#45; and let the most selfish of us take over the city council.&amp;nbsp; Put simply, we&#39;ve had front row seats to the financial equivalent of the sacking of Rome.
Our youngsters &#45; whom we&#39;ve cumulatively permitted to electronically anesthetize themselves because we were too stoned on the punch to care &#45; are finally waking up and coming out to take their place in the neighborhood to find that the shutters are off, the roofs are holed, the street lights are burnt out and the sewage system is backing up.&amp;nbsp; If you think that &amp;quot;electronically anesthetized&amp;quot; is a poor choice, consider this.&amp;nbsp; There are 168 hours in each week and the teens are in school for about 40 hours weekly during the school year, or about 24% of their week.&amp;nbsp; The average teen also sleeps an average of 7 hours nightly &#45; too little for their bodies &#45; for 49 hours weekly, about 29%.&amp;nbsp; The average teen spends 50 hours weekly tied into some electronic device &#45; television, computer, etc &#45; for another 29% but an hour more plugged in than is spent sleeping.&amp;nbsp; This is time that&#39;s not spent learning about the reality of the real world around them and when suddenly thrown into it after years of false messaging, the cognitive dissonance is overwhelming.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s something out of The Matrix as these kids are left trying to reconcile what they&#39;ve heard with what they have to contend.&amp;nbsp;
The economics solidly support the notion that a college degree is necessary for a better future as incomes exceed those of high school graduates and they&#39;re aware of this.&amp;nbsp; But the debt incurred to obtain the degree can never be discharged and they&#39;re saddled with it; they&#39;ll work multiple jobs, without benefits, to help pay the debt.&amp;nbsp; While the real, flesh and blood entities are held to account, the fictitious legal entities, the corporations, are given all manner of assistance to help cover for their mistakes.&amp;nbsp; There are no consequences for horrendous decisions and practices and the corporate leadership still manages to receive the benefits for whatever they do both right and wrong &#45; socialize the losses and privatize the gains.&amp;nbsp; Yet these leaders have actively pursued practices that have sent the jobs overseas, living wage jobs that are desperately needed by the new generation to help remove the load and permit them to start a decent life.&amp;nbsp; In this new economic world that&#39;s been created, there are certainly jobs but these are and will continue to such positions as baristas and desk clerks.&amp;nbsp; The factory and lathe jobs?&amp;nbsp; These went to China with the factory equipment.&amp;nbsp; The kids are awakening to find that what they&#39;ve been told and touted is pure rubbish.&amp;nbsp; In their thinking, and I agree, they&#39;ll be held to task for their debts while the corporate and financial leaders will continue to be coddled and protected for their actions and inactions.&amp;nbsp; They expect no assistance from the elected officials since many are in the pockets of the contributors who&#39;ve financed their (re)elections and helped to maintain a privileged lifestyle in which they aren&#39;t required to participate in the same systems &#45; health insurance, for instance &#45; as the rest of us.&amp;nbsp; What else is there to do but to take to the streets, as did some of their forebears?&amp;nbsp;
Given how many of these youngsters are already working multiple part&#45;time jobs to somehow cobble together a life that ultimately frees them from what is essentially debt serfdom, I don&#39;t believe the assertion that they&#39;re unwilling to work.&amp;nbsp; I hear the increasing attacks on them coming from conservative commentators and candidates, such as Herman Cain, and for the first time truly believe that a class war is now being fully engaged.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These youngsters are now pushing back and it&#39;s becoming apparent by both the verbal attacks and police mace attacks on young women that the established order doesn&#39;t like it.&amp;nbsp; What these folks have to consider is that these protestors have parents, whom Nixon would have referred to as the great&amp;nbsp;Silent Majority, and that we aren&#39;t going to sit back and let our children be abused by the Powers That Be.
If my children should decide to join this effort, then I&#39;m likely to join them.

<title>Herman Cain:&nbsp; Don&#8217;t Blame Wall Street?</title>
<body>&amp;quot;Don&#39;t blame Wall Street, don&#39;t blame the big banks, if you don&#39;t have a job and you&#39;re not rich, blame yourself. It is not someone&#39;s fault if they succeeded, it is someone&#39;s fault if they failed,&amp;quot; stated Herman Cain, Republican presidential candidate.
&amp;nbsp;
Actually Herman, I do blame them.&amp;nbsp; For good measure, let&#39;s throw in the failed shot at globalization in which corporations outsourced hundreds of thousands of jobs and thousands of factories.&amp;nbsp; I get the whole money will flow to the lower wage areas as our labor costs are too high meme, but this became a wholesale gutting of our industrial base as our senior executives went for the Wall Street gold that comes with higher share prices and stock options.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
There was a time when I thoroughly agreed with him, when there were huge gaping holes in the welfare programs that permitted generations to go without having to find a job.&amp;nbsp; My wife and I worked long and hard and it didn&#39;t seem right that we&#39;d come home at 8 PM to eat briefly, watch a half hour of television before going to bed and starting the whole process again; the generational Welfare poster models could get by without having to do that.&amp;nbsp; Time and a bit of perspective has changed that view.&amp;nbsp; Of course, there was also a time when an executive who screwed up massively got the black boot instead of the golden parachute.
&amp;nbsp;
I do blame Wall Street and in their public way, the business networks.&amp;nbsp; The ongoing talk of quarterly profits and almost gossipy conversation about share prices over the decades has shortened our time frame to a point at which there&#39;s never any serious thought about long&#45;term strategies extending beyond the next three years.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The share price is languishing and we need to&amp;nbsp;show the market that we&#39;re serious.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s cut costs by closing three facilities.&amp;nbsp; Bang, and there&#39;s another 550 people&amp;nbsp;out of&amp;nbsp;work.&amp;nbsp; (For the record, I worked for a firm that did close facilities to make to a point to the Street&amp;nbsp;and people living deep in flyover country lost their&amp;nbsp;jobs as&amp;nbsp;a result).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
I also blame the big banks.&amp;nbsp; Our national debt has gone on to ludicrous levels, almost 100% of GDP and dangerously near if not past the point of tipping the country into insolvency, partially to help support the financial system.&amp;nbsp; This is a system that has drunkenly acted to goose their profitability by providing loans to anybody that could fog a mirror and then slipped into Patient Zero mode with Wall Street by passing the ebola&#45;laced loans to investors across the world.&amp;nbsp; As Captain&amp;nbsp;Renault famously stated in Casablanca, &amp;quot;I am shocked, shocked that gambling is going on in here.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; These same financial establishments reached Too&#45;Big&#45;Too&#45;Fail status and the executives realized that they could figuratively boink any bad asset in the world and we&#39;d have to keep dosing &#39;em with expensive antibiotics since we really had no choice.
&amp;nbsp;
Are these guys the only cause for the situation in which we find ourselves?&amp;nbsp; Honestly, no.&amp;nbsp; But they are poster children for the literal collapse of ethical and moral behavior in our society as they pursued financial gain to any end, completely devoid of any concern about the damage that would be ultimately wreaked upon other individuals and society as a whole.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, even I bear some responsibility for this mess as I also bought into both the globalization and materialism philosophies that helped bring us into this place.
&amp;nbsp;
Do I blame someone for being poor?&amp;nbsp; In the previous version of America, some poor person could rise to higher economic levels because of their smarts, actions and sheer luck.&amp;nbsp; But when folks are laid off because their employer outsources or simply goes bankrupt, this simply isn&#39;t their fault.&amp;nbsp; In most cases, they played the game by the rules as they understood them and became collateral damage.&amp;nbsp; People can be poor because of bad decisions in a good economy, but with this mess that we&#39;ve got, many of the &amp;quot;poor&amp;quot; are folks who are collateral damage in a much larger drama being played out around them.
&amp;nbsp;
Is it someone&#39;s fault when they succeed?&amp;nbsp; No, I&#39;d like to believe that people succeed through dint of their own effort and sweat*.&amp;nbsp; But I now&amp;nbsp;believe that the asterisk to this statement lies in their career choice and locale; a guy who opens a barber shop and grows it into a chain of shops around a three county area did it via much effort and sweat.&amp;nbsp; Some 29 year&#45;old with a salary in the hundreds of thousands or millions and who is connected to the financial establishment?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s where I furrow my brow and wonder.
&amp;nbsp;
I understand that Herman Cain is a self&#45;made man and I applaud him for that.&amp;nbsp; My question today would be, could he accomplish the same thing in today&#39;s bizarre economic environment and economy?
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Small Decrease Due to Grocer Substitution</title>
<body>The October results of the PracticalDad Price Index came in as the average cost of the 47 item marketbasket fell by $.23&amp;nbsp;to $188.34; the October index level is 105.58 and down from September&#39;s 105.71.&amp;nbsp; The long and short is that the cost of the marketbasket has risen by 5.58% from the original cost in November 2010.
The month saw small price rises in 14 items against price declines in six products.&amp;nbsp; That said, the decline is due to a grocer making a significant change in their generic diaper packaging as they apparently heard &amp;nbsp;Representative Bernie Sanders&#39; filibuster refrain ...and mothers can&#39;t afford diapers.&amp;nbsp; There was a small total price rise in the package, but the number of diapers in that package increased significantly, from 76 diapers per box to 96 diapers per box, thus driving the per diaper cost down significantly (by more than 15%).&amp;nbsp; Had it not been for this instance, the market basket would have risen to 106.1 and providing yet another increase.
This particular grocer also managed to drive down the cost of their generic spaghetti sauce, probably by finding a different supplier; there was no change to the package sizing.

<title>PracticalDad Discipline:&nbsp; (Re)Grounding the Kids</title>
<body>Teddy, have you forgotten who you are?
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Parent to elderly acquaintance when he was a child
Many years ago, I had a conversation with an older gentleman who related that that was the common phrase uttered by his mother when he misbehaved or did something dumb.&amp;nbsp; The implication of the phrase was that he had been raised to not only know better but to actually behave better as well.&amp;nbsp; His parents assured that he knew the difference between right and wrong and could never blame misbehavior or errors in judgment on not having known.&amp;nbsp; In a sense, they wanted to assure that he knew who he was and that he was firmly grounded in the family values.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s something that we miss and need to remember when we ground our own children for disciplinary reasons.&amp;nbsp; Grounding isn&#39;t just a punitive measure because we&#39;re either too terrified to let them out or we just want to throw away the key in complete frustration.
To say that a person is grounded is typically a compliment, such as she&#39;s a good person who&#39;s really grounded.&amp;nbsp; If you look up ground in the Merriam Webster&#39;s Dictionary, there are a multitude of definitions and one of them pertains to furnishing &amp;quot;with a foundation of knowledge.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Apply that to the person who&#39;s really grounded and you mean that she has a solid understanding of herself and the world around her.&amp;nbsp;
When kids screw up, and it can be spectacular, one of the common parental responses is to ground the child from favorite activities or pastimes so that they learn from the transgression.&amp;nbsp; But that can also mean banishment to the bedroom or some other place away and apart from the family.&amp;nbsp; In the short term, it means that the child will stay alive a little while longer and that you will too because that risk of stroke&amp;nbsp;is lessened when they&#39;re absent.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#39;s only to likely be a short term fix if there&#39;s no continual involvement and followup to re&#45;engage and help him remember who he is and what the family values are.&amp;nbsp; In the heat of the moment, we forget that the root of the word discipline pertains to&amp;nbsp;learning and teaching&amp;nbsp;and that means that we have to be the adults and put away the anger and fear;&amp;nbsp;we must make purposeful efforts to spend time with them in whatever way possible to help reconnect them to the family values and lessons.&amp;nbsp; I have to rake, come hold the bag for me.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m going to take the car in for an oil change, come along and we&#39;ll go next door for a soda.&amp;nbsp; Come and watch this with me, I think that it&#39;s something that you&#39;ll appreciate.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m going to walk the dog so get your jacket on and grab a plastic bag.&amp;nbsp; In other words, it does no good to ground them if we make no further efforts to ground them as well.
The next time that you have to ground your child, take a little time to cool off.&amp;nbsp; Spend the evening away from him, take a walk, drink a beer or go beat your head to a bloody pulp against the wall.&amp;nbsp; After things are back in perspective, then go back and start the hard work of actually grounding your child.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Physical Changes, Political Changes</title>
<body>The stated belief is that fatherhood changes a man.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s recent research that links fatherhood to lower testosterone&amp;nbsp;and there&#39;s now a new study that finds that fathers actually have a lower risk of death from heart disease and stroke.&amp;nbsp; Where&amp;nbsp;fatherhood has changed me is in my economic and political views; I&#39;m not the political man that I was before the birth of my children.&amp;nbsp; The inactions of our political class and actions of our financial elites have inculcated a corrupt system that threatens the ability of my children &#45; our children &#45; to have any meaningful life apart from that of serf or debt slave.&amp;nbsp; If you want a clue of how a guy went from conservative Republican to a man who cheered on Bernie Sanders&#39; filibuster, try to view the changes in our nation through the prism of how it actually applies to&amp;nbsp;the children.
Forget looking at this for&amp;nbsp;the children.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s&amp;nbsp;actually focus on a select group which has identifiable names and faces and&amp;nbsp;in this case,&amp;nbsp;it will&amp;nbsp;be my&amp;nbsp;eldest child&#39;s&amp;nbsp;high school class.&amp;nbsp; If you want to broaden it, then consider all of the kids that you can actually name and recognize from the activities, the bus stop and Chuck E Cheese if that works for you.&amp;nbsp; Eldest is an upperclassman&amp;nbsp;at the local high school and there are about 450 students in her grade.&amp;nbsp; To make this even more interesting, grab a copy&amp;nbsp;of your kid&#39;s high school&amp;nbsp;yearbook and consider these statistics as you page through it.&amp;nbsp;
Recently, ProPublica&amp;nbsp;ran an article that compiled the changes in poverty statistics over the past several years&amp;nbsp;and the changes are informative.&amp;nbsp; What makes them scary is to actually apply them in a real life setting amongst flesh&#45;and&#45;blood human beings that you can identify and who walk through your door.&amp;nbsp;
Poverty Applied
In one year &#45; 2009 to 2010 &#45; the percentage of those living in poverty with a family&#45;of&#45;four income less than $22314 rose from 14.3 to 15.1.&amp;nbsp; The poverty line for only one person is roughly half that, at $11,139.&amp;nbsp; That means that 68 of Eldest&#39;s classmates will wind up with incomes below the poverty limit when they&#39;re truly functioning economic adults and earning a fulltime &#45; or not &#45; income.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re less likely to have cohesive families and they will actually face the situation of not eating&amp;nbsp;because their maximum weekly income of $200 won&#39;t cover food, gas and housing.&amp;nbsp;
Of this 15.1%, almost half &#45; 6.7% &#45; aren&#39;t even earning half of the poverty line.&amp;nbsp; So of these 68 classmates &#45; and I can&#39;t be certain that even Eldest won&#39;t be among them &#45; 30 of them will be literally destitute.&amp;nbsp;
The income data is also disturbing.&amp;nbsp; Since the start of the recession &#45; which has technically been over, in case no one informed you &#45; the median household income has dropped by 6.4% to $49,445 and hasn&#39;t been this low since 1996.&amp;nbsp; A full decade and a half&amp;nbsp;of income growth&amp;nbsp;have been wiped away.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Since neither&amp;nbsp;I nor anybody else&amp;nbsp;can truly identify&amp;nbsp;any organic income drivers, apart from a mass exodus sponsored by Virgin/Alcoa to mine precious metals on the outer planets of the solar system, Eldest&#39;s classmates are looking at a retrenchment of median family income back to levels of decades ago.&amp;nbsp; Forget wide&#45;screen plasma television and say&amp;nbsp;hello to&amp;nbsp;Betamax.&amp;nbsp; A certain percentage will&amp;nbsp;leave to find employment, perhaps&amp;nbsp;from the planet for Phoebe and Europa, where&amp;nbsp;the occasional hardy pioneer&amp;nbsp;will likely die in an explosive decompression of a faulty airlock.&amp;nbsp; His widow and kids will receive a tidy life&#45;insurance settlement and a year&#39;s free supply of aluminum foil.
Even with &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; about 1 in 6 six Americans in poverty, the grinding down of the economic machine is creating casualties as more than 45 million Americans in over 19 million households now receive some manner of food stamp assistance.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s approximately 17% of the households (19 million households divided by 112 million total US households) and if&amp;nbsp;Eldest and each classmate forms their own future household, the present number means that 77 kids would receive food stamps.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind that the food stamp&amp;nbsp;trend has been upward and the currect predicament is that there are no economic drivers to help pull things out going forward.&amp;nbsp; As incomes drop and the cost of food increases &#45; the cost of a sample marketbasket in my area has risen by more than 5.5%&amp;nbsp;&#45; since November 2010, the number of families forced into the food stamp program will steadily climb.&amp;nbsp;
Wealth Applied
Where things get startling, at least for me, is the application of wealth statistics to Eldest&#39;s class.
Recent data breaks out the distribution of wealth amongst the American society and the top 1% of our households &#45; in terms of income &#45;&amp;nbsp;control almost 35% of wealth (high liquidity assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate and business equity&amp;nbsp;less debt) and the next 19% control an additional 50% of the nation&#39;s wealth.&amp;nbsp; The bottom 40% of the households control less than 1% of the nation&#39;s wealth.&amp;nbsp;
Looking at Eldest&#39;s class in a microcosm, more than a third of all of the wealth that they produce would be controlled directly by five of the 450 class members and fully 85% of the wealth would be controlled by 90 of them.&amp;nbsp; The bottom 180 class members would have less than 1% of the cumulative wealth.&amp;nbsp; Because power comes with wealth, the great majority of Eldest&#39;s class will have to hope that these five classmates are decent people given all of the power that they&#39;ll possess.&amp;nbsp; Since those who reach high financial and corporate positions are increasingly questioned as to their psychological makeup &#45; Hmmm, I wonder if Biff is a sociopath? &#45; I doubt that that&#39;s going to generally be the case.&amp;nbsp;
Eldest&#39;s class &#45; our children &#45; is going to be subjected to a lesson in making social Taffy.&amp;nbsp; The stresses of the ongoing economic decline are going to pull more and more downwards on the economic strata and that&#39;s bad enough.&amp;nbsp; But the rules and behaviors that have permitted an increasing few to garner more wealth and power, if left unchecked, are going to pull those few further upwards and the middle is going to be stretched thin to the point at which it breaks completely.&amp;nbsp;
Try something the next time that you see the children line up at the playground, walk onto the stage for an elementary or high school concert or walk through the doors at the dance at which you&#39;ve dropped them.&amp;nbsp; Make a mental count of each sixth child and consign that child to a life of poverty and an inability to even afford sufficient food for their own family.&amp;nbsp; If there are enough, count every other child and consign that child to a life in which they have little wealth and for whom the classic dream of retirement is just that and they can expect to die in the traces.
Then see if your perspective changes when you realize that one of these is your own child.</body>

<title>Ron Paul, Punker</title>
<body>One of the more unexpected sights at this summer&#39;s Van&#39;s Warped Tour punk concert was a stand touting Ron Paul as President in 2012.&amp;nbsp; It stood next to a Libertarian Party stand that attracted teens like moths to a flame with it&#39;s tie&#45;dyed marijuana logo flag and some of the teens then slid over to receive free copies of the Constitution from the Paul supporters.&amp;nbsp; According to the adults at the stand, the Libertarian stand provided concert&#45;goers with surveys that helped them identify themselves in the political realm and the large majority of the youth were strongly Libertarian.&amp;nbsp; And providing copies of the Constitution?&amp;nbsp; While my initial take was amused disbelief, I&#39;ve come to think of it not only as very smart but also as something that&#39;s desperately needed.
One of my great criticisms of today&#39;s youth &#45; and parents by extension &#45; is that they&#39;ve willingly tuned out to the world around them.&amp;nbsp; I sometimes also bear some of the same criticism as it&#39;s simply tiring of having to always shoo teens away&amp;nbsp; from&amp;nbsp;the various electronic media, but it&#39;s a chronic and recurrent necessity as Youtube and Facebook are infinitely easier to understand than the vagaries and intricacies of abortion debates and budget deadlocks.&amp;nbsp; This was brought home last week by an encounter with Middle, who was stalling on studying his US History assignment on the Constitution.&amp;nbsp; It was hammer and tongs for a short period and then he simply blurted out what&#39;s the point anyway?&amp;nbsp; The government&#39;s corrupt and none of them give a damn about anything but themselves...whether this was a true statement of his belief or just another dodge (it certainly didn&#39;t work) is uncertain, but the fact that he could make such such a statement and then back it up was eye&#45;opening.&amp;nbsp; After listening to his comments, I could only state that if we really don&#39;t make an effort to learn what the document both is and was meant to be, then the political situation would only&amp;nbsp;continue to fester.&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly, he nodded and then moved to take care of his lesson.
The kids are absolutely ill&#45;informed about the world and their place in it, and some of that is on us as parents.&amp;nbsp; But they&#39;re not completely unaware and from what I hear from my two eldest, are irritated at the state of things.&amp;nbsp; The austerity meme is percolating through their walls of indifference and they&#39;re actively questioning why the school budget for the Arts is decimated while there&#39;s money for installing surveillance cameras in every classroom.&amp;nbsp; For them, it&#39;s both a question of priorities and whether such a degree of watching is either safe or necessary.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re also listening to their friends who are now in college and beginning to grasp the difficulties they face as we&#39;ve managed to give away the employment farm and are on the cusp of an economic downsizing on a generational level.&amp;nbsp; Should they pay greater attention to the Constitution?&amp;nbsp; Absolutely, as now&amp;nbsp;two members of the political class &#45; the North Carolina governor and the former head of Obama&#39;s Office of Management and Budget &#45; are questioning whether we should just either not hold elections or turn the business of state to appointed councils to avoid that nasty political bickering; if Ron Paul&#39;s libertarian beliefs and punk rock are what motivates our present punkers and future leaders to read the Constitution, then I plan to take my kids to the Warped Tour concerts for as long as they&#39;ll want to go.

<title>A Tribe of Teens</title>
<body>Teens are fascinating to watch.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re so thoroughly involved in finding their identity and fitting in with a particular group that the various masses of teens change form reminiscent of an amoeba, as various members roll in or choose to &#45; or are expelled &#45; leave, thus altering the amoeba&#39;s shape again.&amp;nbsp; It would be a fascinating minuet to watch but that teens generally don&#39;t participate in something so intricate; that particular skill comes later.
The best way to describe teens in the group setting is almost as&amp;nbsp;a tribe.&amp;nbsp; They cluster together and the more time that they&#39;re spent unmonitored, the more opportunity that they have to blend their hormonal sauces into what can be a highly combustible stew.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s bad enough when no adult is around to just keep tabs on things, but the pure absence of parental supervision can distill a 100&#45;proof moonshine of sheer lunacy.&amp;nbsp; The kids are gathered around with the metal or techno&#45;pop roaring in the background, the bass reverberating against the walls and as conversation passes with time and merges with the beat of the rhythm, a recognizable pattern begins to emerge from the noise, a patois that seamlessly merges the steadily cadenced rhythm with the muttered conversations that finally emerges as a simple chant reverberating off of the walls...
Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna&amp;nbsp; Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna Hey&#45;ya&#45;wanna Hey&#45;ya&#45;wannaHey&#45;ya&#45;wannaHeyyawannaheyyawannaheyyawannaheyyawanna...
Hey, ya wanna jump off of the roof?
Hey, ya wanna climb the town water tower and hang upside down?
Hey, ya wanna smack each other with a stick?
Hey, ya wanna paint Steve&#39;s toenails?
Hey, ya wanna get Ozzy&#39;s face tattooed on your butt?
Hey, ya wanna ride to the 7&#45;11 on the roof of my car?
The permutations are often novel, especially in this day of Youtube, but mind&#45;numbingly similar in their sheer and utter lack of self&#45;regard and common sense.&amp;nbsp; Anyone with teens will recognize the egging on and it quietly terrifies me as I can see any number of ways that something can end badly.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this concern that causes us to provide a place for them to gather, a place that they can be exceedingly, frustratingly and wonderfully stupid, a place that we can at least have a sense of what&#39;s happening.&amp;nbsp; If &#39;wonderfully&#39; seems to be an odd wordchoice, it&#39;s one that I use because the rhythmic chant stirs up old, fond memories of when I also belonged to a tribe.&amp;nbsp; One that I&#39;ve outgrown but still holds a special place in my heart and soul.&amp;nbsp;
So my wife and I will provide the facilities as they&#39;re wanted, and we&#39;ll do our best to keep tabs on the comings&#45;and&#45;goings.&amp;nbsp; And I&#39;ll continue to mutter the occasional silent prayer that our kids not kill themselves in those moments when we can&#39;t keep tabs.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Fatherhood and Testosterone (Take Two)</title>
<body>Author&#39;s Note:&amp;nbsp; This is why I generally try to write while the kids aren&#39;t around.&amp;nbsp; I get distracted and hit the &#39;Submit&#39; button instead of &#39;Save&#39;.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s try this again...
According to recent research from the National Academy of Sciences, there&#39;s a statistically significant link &#45; the probability is less than .001 that it&#39;s a complete fluke&#45; between the time that a guy spends caring for his child(ren) and his testosterone level.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s hit all of the media outlets from Yahoo to television and by next week, will probably be a movie of the week on Lifetime.&amp;nbsp; The hypothesis is that significant involvement with childcare, defined as greater than 3 hours daily, causes significant decline in the testosterone level as the male shifts from a need to propagate his line to one of actually raising it.&amp;nbsp; The apparent company line is that children in their sweet tenderness naturally soften the savage male heart, bringing the father ever so nearere to the bosom of his hearth and home.&amp;nbsp; Reading some of the media reports makes me see everything in a soft, gauzy glow akin to a Christmas hearth from a Hallmark card.
Let me speak from experience for a moment.&amp;nbsp; When you&#39;re responsible for cleaning up &#45; and after &#45; kids, feeding and caring for them, you have absolutely no time and little desire and energy to father any more.&amp;nbsp; As wonderful as children are, the daily life of raising a small child can be a grind.&amp;nbsp; Toss in a dose of sleep deprivation and there you have it.
Is there a linkage between time spent in childcare and lower testosterone levels?&amp;nbsp; According to this, yep, and I don&#39;t dispute it in the least.&amp;nbsp; But some of the company line of why smacks of a preconceived notion or an agenda.&amp;nbsp; Testosterone levels can be linked to causes as disparate as chemo and radiation treatment for cancer and the tightness of one&#39;s underwear (women think that briefs are sexier, but they can cause a guy to shoot blanks).&amp;nbsp; Testosterone is produced by the male&#39;s testes but if you follow the production process backwards from the testes, the testes production is stimulated by chemicals produced by the pituitary gland.&amp;nbsp; The Pituitary gland receives it&#39;s marching orders from the hypothalamus, which is a lower level segment of the brain that controls hormone and other autonomic functions.&amp;nbsp; The hypothalamus itself receives it&#39;s own set of orders from the cerebral cortex, which is one of the most advanced segments of the brain.&amp;nbsp; Typically, feelings of success, arousal and confidence will spur the cortex to kick the hypothalamus into gear, literally saying hey, go get me some more of that stuff!&amp;nbsp; Yowza!
My own sense is that any cause is more related to the issues in the cortex than anything else.&amp;nbsp; Raising kids is a challenge on multiple levels and a guy can feel wholly overwhelmed in the early periods.&amp;nbsp; Why is she crying?&amp;nbsp; What does she need &#45; diaper, food or is this colic?&amp;nbsp; How do I handle it when I can&#39;t get him to go down for his nap?&amp;nbsp; Damn, who do I cover first when one is crying from an ear infection and the other has just vomited on the sofa?&amp;nbsp; How can I feel good about myself when I&#39;ve only had four hours of sleep and haven&#39;t showered in two days?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s sometimes a situation of reacting to one situation or another with a recurrent fear that something&#39;s been done wrong and that you&#39;re&amp;nbsp;a damned lousy parent.&amp;nbsp;
So much for feelings of success and confidence.
There is something that I&#39;d like to see with this study since it does have real value.&amp;nbsp; The sample consisted of young Filipino men in their early and mid twenties; what is the effect on testosterone several years in the future, after the kids are through the stage of requiring such hands&#45;on, intense attention?&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;re only one generation of fathers in a lineage of untold generations of fathers and somehow, with some perseverance and considerable attention, we&#39;ll do just fine.&amp;nbsp; But we are different in that we&#39;re the first generation of men in a long while to really begin to hit the trenches of childcare and childrearing and we&#39;re discovering what women have known for the longest time, that children require a level of attention that impacts almost all other areas of our lives.&amp;nbsp;

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Must Discipline Be a Contest of Wills?</title>
<body>It had been a brutal session with one of the kids, who frankly refused to do what was asked on multiple occasions.&amp;nbsp; With a father who used to be a drill instructor, I learned how to get into someone&#39;s personal space and face and this is finally what I did when I&#39;d tired of the nonsensical back&#45;and&#45;forth with this recalcitrant &#39;tweener.&amp;nbsp; The face looked up at me as I glared down, inches from the nose and with that, the child retreated to perform the oft&#45;requested task.
My wife shook her head at me and sighed as she said, does it have to be a contest of wills?
It&#39;s a question that has stayed with me since that evening some time ago.&amp;nbsp; Does there have to be a contest of wills between the parent &#45; and when there&#39;s a father around, it often falls to the father &#45; and the child?&amp;nbsp; Discipline is one of the less pleasant sides of parenting and in today&#39;s world, many parents seemingly want to be a friend or pal and nothing puts a dent into being a pal than having to assure that rules are followed and chores performed.&amp;nbsp; It can be much easier and less likely when the kids are smaller &#45; they&#39;re more eager to please, their social world hasn&#39;t expanded to a point at which they&#39;re too heavily influenced by other kids, and they can be more easily redirected when they get stubborn.&amp;nbsp; But shouldn&#39;t it become easier when they become older, seemingly old enough to be reasoned with?
Unfortunately, no.&amp;nbsp;
Kids do grow and as they&#39;re exposed to more people and situations, they start to change.&amp;nbsp; While I can try to pick my battles, there are simply some things that I can&#39;t let slide and this is where it gets hairy.&amp;nbsp; The kids are undergoing huge changes as they explore their sense of independence, their unwillingness to appear &amp;quot;under the thumb&amp;quot; before their peers and the general sense that Dad is now a blithering idiot.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s compounded with male teens as some are surging with the testosterone that makes them believe that they&#39;re ready to assume the role of Alpha male in the household and that is something that can&#39;t be permitted lest the inmates take over the asylum.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s difficult, and this is coming from a guy who&#39;s made it a point to assure that the kids understand from an early age that Mom and Dad have the final say.
So I&#39;ll just have to continue to try to manuever through the situations as they arise and hopefully, keep the clashes to a minimum.&amp;nbsp; But they&#39;re still going to happen.</body>

<title>Brain Development and Television</title>
<body>Enough with the Spongebob and turn the damned thing off.&amp;nbsp; It makes you stupid.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &#45; Periodic comment from PracticalDad to Youngest
And just to prove that I was actually right, a University of Virginia psychology professor published a study in Pediatrics&amp;nbsp;that found that four year old children who watched Spongebob did worse &#45; in a statistically relevant way &#45; than their peers who watched either PBS&#39; Caillou or just drew with markers and crayons.&amp;nbsp; In this particular study, 60 four year&#45;old children were divided into three equal sized groups and each was to participate in that particular activity for a short period of time; at the end of the activity, each child engaged in the same particular series of tasks to test such things as the ability to delay gratification and handle games that require a series of rules.&amp;nbsp; The Spongebob kids did only half as well as those who watched either Caillou or drew.
In all fairness to Spongebob &#45; who is actually funny in limited amounts &#45; the issue isn&#39;t that particular cartoon but instead, the nature and style of the program.&amp;nbsp; Caillou is a mellow cartoon that leads the viewer through a simple, plot&#45;driven story and it doesn&#39;t make it a habit of radically shifting gears in volume and drawing.&amp;nbsp; Years ago, one of the recurrent criticisms of Sesame Street was that the constant intersplicing of skits, cartoons and songs would hinder the development of preschool viewers and that is echoed in this particular study.&amp;nbsp; Programs such as Spongebob and others &#45; Fairly Oddparents,&amp;nbsp; anyone? &#45; now make Sesame Street appear to be the model in flow and style.&amp;nbsp; As one other researcher noted, &amp;quot;not all TV is the same. It&#39;s not about no television, it&#39;s really about appropriate amounts and appropriate types of television&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Watching a program such as Caillou, and I&#39;ve watched it, does require that the child be able to focus on a particular story for a period of time without persistent and chronic interruption and the same goes for the task of drawing and coloring.&amp;nbsp; There is a level of stimulation to the brain that&#39;s more consistent with their age than with the hyperactive Spongebob type of program.&amp;nbsp; With very small children, such simple focusing tasks do&amp;nbsp; have a cumulative effect on the ability to perform as well as to more easily shift gears from one scenario to another, keeping with their age and capacity.
I think that there&#39;s another issue apart from the overstimulation however.&amp;nbsp; Children will often mimic what they see and that&#39;s most certainly the case if they like something.&amp;nbsp; Spongebob glorifies stupidity and kids who&#39;ve just watched another episode of his inanity will, at some level, want to play out what they&#39;ve seen; immediately immersing kid viewers in a series of exercises requiring the opposite of what Spongebob promotes is setting them up for failure.&amp;nbsp; This kind of behavior is no different than that of teens who watch Dodgeball for the umpteenth time and immediately spend ten minutes tossing objects at one another, yelling if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball!
As the one researcher noted, the issue isn&#39;t the program itself, although it is indeed phenomenally dumb.&amp;nbsp; The issue is that we&#39;re&amp;nbsp;allowing the kids to spend all of this time in front of a screen without chasing them off and making them learn to do something else.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s value for a child to lay in his bed or look out the window and daydream, just as there&#39;s value in drawing, playing with blocks and chasing down neighborhood kids to go play.&amp;nbsp; I understand the draw both of television to the child and of ease for the parent, but it&#39;s a battle that&#39;s going to have to be waged continuously until they&#39;re out of the house.
For your own curiosity, one of the tasks asked of the kids was the Tower of Hanoi&amp;nbsp;exercise, aptly named since I personally found it torturous to figure out.

<title>Some Comments on Food Prices</title>
<body>For the better part of the last three years, there&#39;s been an ongoing debate about whether the economic climate and monetary policy is going to lead to either deflation or inflation.&amp;nbsp; With all of the talk and uncertainty, I decided a year ago to pull together my own retail grocery price index in order to ascertain what was actually occurring in my own little corner of the world, apart from all of the conjecture and commentary.&amp;nbsp; This led to the birth of the PracticalDad Price Index in November 2010 and unfortunately, this baby&#39;s growing.
There are some thoughts that should be passed along.

    Because I actually managed a local cost&#45;of&#45;living survey when I graduated from college, I do have previous experience in such creatures and this was not a foray into uncharted territory.&amp;nbsp; It took considerable time and consideration beforehand but once established, the process is a straightforward one.
    There is no doubt that this is not a national effort and it is purely what&#39;s occurring at the retail grocery level for a particular county in the Middle Atlantic region of the United States.&amp;nbsp; However, while there may be differences from the Mid&#45;Atlantic to the West Coast to the Boston&#45;Washington corridor, the question isn&#39;t what the actual prices are from one place to another so much as what&#39;s happening to the level of the prices.&amp;nbsp; Having lived throughout the mid&#45;South, Suburban Maryland/DC and Mid&#45;Atlantic regions, I know full well that grapes are more expensive in New Jersey than they are where I live.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;m hard pressed to say that what&#39;s happening with prices in my county is contained solely to my county; two of the three grocers surveyed have operations far beyond the county borders and all three of them obtain their products from wholesalers and manufacturers&amp;nbsp;that are supporting stores across an expansive geographic area.&amp;nbsp; Might prices be up a half&#45;percent less elsewhere?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps, the reality is that they are up significantly beyond what&#39;s admitted to by the official statisticians in the US government and that&#39;s what this effort shows.
    Aside from having previous experience with a survey, I&#39;m also the guy who did the shopping for years (and while my wife does more because she likes it, I still do the lion&#39;s share).&amp;nbsp; When I determined what items should compose the 47 item market basket, I drew heavily upon my experience shopping for a very young family of five.&amp;nbsp; What does a family, having recently undergone a 55% paycut, have to do make the dollar stretch farther?&amp;nbsp; What are the basic items that we need to purchase in order to stock our pantry and feed ourselves?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s why the market basket is stocked with basics such as hamburger, white bread, oatmeal, apples and carrots.&amp;nbsp; The other premise was based upon my experience of sticking whenever possible to store brands in order to save pennies.&amp;nbsp; There are a few products that my wife disliked enough that I returned to name brands, but my thinking was that the cumulative total of buying store brand everything saved enough to make it worthwhile.
    This is what makes a 5.71% rise in the cost of the basket frankly scary.&amp;nbsp; The items comprising the basket are basics without any real room for substitution.&amp;nbsp; If you give up arugula, you can shift to iceberg lettuce and if Campbell&#39;s becomes too costly, you can go to the store brand.&amp;nbsp; But how do you replace 80% hamburger or store brand white bread?&amp;nbsp; When budgets no longer allow for restaurants, people can opt to cook.&amp;nbsp; But what do you use when cooking oil becomes too costly?
    As a child in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I recall news reports of housewives picketing their grocers because the cost of food was rising beyond their budgets.&amp;nbsp; But having watched the actions of the grocers for the past eleven months, I actually have to admire some of their decisions and don&#39;t consider them to be the &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Understand that the grocery business is one with exceptionally thin profit margins so that there isn&#39;t any real ability for them to eat the losses.&amp;nbsp; There have been multiple instances in which more than one grocer has had items for sale with considerable savings prior to raising the price; you can argue that it&#39;s done in order to hide the real price increase over the two or three week period &#45; wait, was that the price before I bought it on sale three weeks ago?&amp;nbsp; Nah... &#45; but it&#39;s also giving folks the opportunity to stock up on an item in advance.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, I&#39;m now seeing where the grocer is actually dropping their store brand for that particular size and replacing it with a much lower cost off&#45;brand product.&amp;nbsp; Good business for them?&amp;nbsp; Sure, but it&#39;s also an acknowledgement that they understand that folks are stretching and they&#39;re acting to assist the consumers.
    While two points don&#39;t make a trend, the fact that the market basket rose half as much in two months in the previous nine months is worrisome and could indicate that retail food inflation is picking up a head of steam more quickly than the government or Federal Reserve would want to acknowledge.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m honestly anxious about the pricing that&#39;s going to be done in early October.

Time will tell.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Retail Grocery Basket Up Another .81%; 2% Over Two Months</title>
<body>September&#39;s pricing of the 47 item PracticalDad grocery basket showed that the cost of the basket rose .81% from August&#39;s level with the September index now at 105.71; cumulatively, the cost of the market basket is now 5.71% higher than that at the November 2010 inception.
Inflation at the retail grocery level appears to be starting to surge as the cost of the market basket rose almost 2% from July to September; it had risen 3.71% in the preceding nine month period of November 2010 to July 2011.

So what&#39;s notable about the September pricing?

    Grocers are making significant changes to keep prices under control.&amp;nbsp; In one instance this month, a grocer kept the same price and size for coffee (@ 11 oz) but went from a can to a vacuum&#45;packed brick.&amp;nbsp; In another, a grocer actually dropped the price of their 42 ounce container of one&#45;minute oatmeal by 30% but did so by completely eliminating their own store&#45;brand and replacing it with a much lower cost off&#45;brand oatmeal.&amp;nbsp; Had it not been for this particular effect, the Index would have been higher.
    Produce at the retail level rose again as the average cost of potatoes from three stores rose by an additional 7.9% and apples also rose by a full 10%.&amp;nbsp; Eggs shot up in price by almost 17%, but this product has shown that it can fluctuate in price over the past year so it&#39;s uncertain whether such an increase will stick.
    There were fewer items that had price increases than last month, as well as items with rises greater than 5%.

<title>Who Are You to Judge Them?</title>
<body>I believe in serendipity and after tonight&#39;s dinner conversation about judging people, I was struck by Gonzalo Lira&#39;s essay on our collective unwillingness to make judgments.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Lira makes his case about our unwillingness to pass judgment, especially in light of former Vice&#45;President Cheney&#39;s recent book being issued shortly.&amp;nbsp; His stance, eerily similar to mine, is that we have to be willing to make judgments as we go through life and that these judgments are best predicated upon some basis of morality.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s no framework for making decisions based upon a common sense of right and wrong, then decisions are reduced to the more base calculations of economic, social and political self&#45;interest.
I am a child of the 1970s and actually nodded my head as I read Lira&#39;s spot&#45;on commentary:
&amp;quot;Starting with the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, our society has marinated in the notion that no one has a right to judge how you live: You can do your own thing, to borrow the phrase from the time. Not only does society not have the right to judge the way you live as to its rightness or wrongness&amp;mdash;society does not have the right to judge you. &amp;quot;
The&amp;nbsp;dude&#39;s got it right.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;recall&amp;nbsp;conversations with my Red Forman&#45;esque father, who passed judgments frequently and as I later&amp;nbsp;came to recognize, with uncanny accuracy.&amp;nbsp; I had&amp;nbsp;my own set of rules that I&#39;d adopted &#45; yes, I actually wrote up&amp;nbsp;a series of basic rules for living my life&amp;nbsp;&#45; and foremost of which was that everybody had a&amp;nbsp;story to tell and a right to be heard.&amp;nbsp; It didn&#39;t sink in that&amp;nbsp;listening and drawing someone out required an ability to&amp;nbsp;not&amp;nbsp;make judgments&amp;nbsp;lest the person be offended and their story not be heard.&amp;nbsp; I was fed by the decade&#39;s mantra also because making a judgment is an inherent&amp;nbsp;criticism, for better or worse.&amp;nbsp; The person on the receiving end of the judgment will likely&amp;nbsp;be upset&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;in the age of Mr. Rogers, Sesame&amp;nbsp;Street and the Electric&amp;nbsp;Company, we wouldn&#39;t want&amp;nbsp;to upset someone because that wouldn&#39;t be&amp;nbsp;nice&amp;nbsp;and might hurt their feelings.&amp;nbsp; My&amp;nbsp;father would listen to me&amp;nbsp;and point out how things were and there were moments, like Eric and Red Forman, when he flat out called me a&amp;nbsp;dumbass.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
What I realize thirty&amp;nbsp;plus years later is that that was&amp;nbsp;part of his job as a father.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;First, kids and teens are acutely aware&amp;nbsp;of the social order and the social interactions&amp;nbsp;amongst them can be&amp;nbsp;brutal and cruel;&amp;nbsp;they simply&amp;nbsp;haven&#39;t had the time to grow&amp;nbsp;the thick skin that comes with experience and&amp;nbsp;many are consequently loathe to say anything that sounds critical&amp;nbsp;or judgmental.&amp;nbsp; Parents have to worry about putting a roof&amp;nbsp;over the head and food on&amp;nbsp;the table and kids worry about whether or not they&#39;re liked&amp;nbsp;by their peers and anything that endangers that desire for love is anathema.&amp;nbsp; Second,&amp;nbsp;morality is&amp;nbsp;learned&amp;nbsp;instead of&amp;nbsp;instinctual and if someone isn&#39;t willing to demonstrate that being moral sometimes requires a rather hardheaded attitude, then the kids simply&amp;nbsp;won&#39;t learn because they haven&#39;t seen it.&amp;nbsp; Going along to get along isn&#39;t always the best choice for handling a situation.
So who am I to make judgments?&amp;nbsp;

    I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s been around long enough to recognize the potential for a train wreck.
    I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s willing to incur both&amp;nbsp;your wrath and the wrath of others when they discover that I really don&#39;t trust them, and kids talk enough that they will learn precisely that.
    I&#39;m the guy who&#39;s ultimately&amp;nbsp;legally responsible for&amp;nbsp;your actions until&amp;nbsp;you&amp;nbsp;reach the age of adulthood.&amp;nbsp;
    I&#39;m the guy that will talk to you even after there&#39;s been a significant blow&#45;up, which isn&#39;t always certain with friends and peers.

Until you&#39;re either willing to make value judgments or are old enough to entertain the legal and moral consequences of not making them, then I&#39;ll make whatever judgments I believe need to be made.

<title>PracticalDad and School:&nbsp; Austerity Comes Home</title>
<body>Our present reality is simple:&amp;nbsp; too many promises and too few resources.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been coming for years and is finally now rippling through the heart of our neighborhoods, only I doubt that everyone fully grasps what it means.&amp;nbsp; A case in point is the neighborhood bus stop.
I live in a geographically large school district, one of the biggest in our county, and like other districts, it&#39;s responsible for providing bus transportation to the various schools.&amp;nbsp; Like other districts as well, it&#39;s being pinched by declining tax revenues and state grants on one hand and the rise in fuel and other costs and the result is an ongoing search for ways to&amp;nbsp;close the gap.&amp;nbsp; There have been numerous measures over the past two years but they&#39;ve largely been unseen and now they&#39;re becoming more obvious.&amp;nbsp; Several weeks before the start of school, the district transportation coordinator sent out the obligatory &amp;quot;bus stop&amp;quot; letters detailing where each child would be able to atch their respective bus; Youngest&#39;s moved to a more distant corner.&amp;nbsp; However, it wasn&#39;t until everybody showed up on&amp;nbsp;the first day of school that the full extent of the change&amp;nbsp;became clear.&amp;nbsp;
It helps to understand our neighborhood&#39;s geography.&amp;nbsp; We live in a relatively new development with only one entry road within almost a full mile from an adjoining entry road.&amp;nbsp; When you enter the development, the road has a left turn within 150 yards of the entrance (we&#39;ll call it road &#39;A&#39;) and if you continue to go straight, the entry road makes a giant loop of approximately one mile&amp;nbsp;before terminating at road &#39;A&#39;, only about 100 yards from where it begins at the original entry road.&amp;nbsp; In simpler terms, envision a fish hook with a straight line&amp;nbsp;running from the barbed end of the hook back&amp;nbsp;to the hook itself, and that&#39;s the neighborhood.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Previously, there were three separate bus stops on this loop.&amp;nbsp; With the new bus routes, our neighborhood&#39;s stops have been slashed from five to two stops.&amp;nbsp; The loop road has been removed from the route and all of the kids now have to walk from their homes on the loop to the first bus stop at the beginning of the loop.&amp;nbsp;
On that first morning, Youngest and I walked to the assigned stop, the one furthest from our house &#45; the one located at the hypothetical barbed end of the fishhook while all of the kids from the loop gathered at the stop at the entry road to the development; there were 17 children along with accompanying parents and siblings at this particular stop.&amp;nbsp; As I walked back after Youngest got onto the bus, I fell into conversation with some of the parents from that stop and again later in the day when the kids were to be dropped off.&amp;nbsp; Several had contacted the school district to complain and request that the loop stops be reinstated for multiple reasons:&amp;nbsp; distance from the house (less than a half mile); nowhere to stand in inclement weather (true) and danger of the intersection.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, the district superintendant actually drove by the stop this morning and spent a few minutes talking with the waiting parents.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, I said nothing since &#45; as I told my wife later &#45; we haven&#39;t got a dog in that hunt and I let someone else carry the conversation.&amp;nbsp; In our view, if the school district moved the bus stop further away in an entirely different direction to save money, then we would&#39;ve considered it as the cost of doing business.&amp;nbsp; The superintendant commiserated since he lives in the district as well and his own three kids are affected along with everyone else&#39;s, but the point was made that cutting that mile loop saves two miles daily and with an entire fleet of buses, the cumulative savings are considerable.&amp;nbsp;
This is an open change that confronts parents directly, since many of them don&#39;t see the other changes that confront the kids.&amp;nbsp; I neither know nor care what the response is going to be, but if this is some of the reaction from simply altering bus routes, then I can&#39;t fathom what some of the reaction is going to be for the changes that are down the road as this ebbing tide of resources recedes further over time.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Knowin&#8217; How to Do Stuff&#8230;</title>
<body>One of the better, truer commercials on television is actually for ED &#45; and no, I don&#39;t have a bathtub in the backyard.&amp;nbsp; In these ads, guys in their 40s are presented with different situations and simply handle them as the announcer comments, when you reach a certain age, you just know how to do stuff...Pulling a horse trailer and the pickup gets stuck in the mud?&amp;nbsp; Hitch the horses and let them pull you out.&amp;nbsp; Engine overheating and in the desert?&amp;nbsp; Just add water at some roadside cafe.
Simple.
That&#39;s kind of the role of a father as the kids get older and begin to think that they know everything.&amp;nbsp; Something goes wrong and Dad gets the call and if he&#39;s smart, he takes the opportunity to pass along the institutional knowledge that comes with age, if not with trace teams of horses.&amp;nbsp;
That&#39;s the situation this morning as Eldest heads off to school in the old car.&amp;nbsp; Because her schedule actually requires some traveling, she drives an old car and lo and behold, she crawls behind the wheel and turns the ignition and is greeted by the sounds of silence.&amp;nbsp; The battery is officially dead and will have to be replaced.&amp;nbsp; Daddy, Mom&#39;s gonna take me to school but can you have the battery fixed for when I get back?&amp;nbsp; Gotta run, bye!
Yes, but you&#39;ve actually going to do it with me so that you can learn.&amp;nbsp;
The result was a&amp;nbsp;quick trip to the auto supply store for a battery and then home to assure that I&#39;ve got the sockets that fit the nuts on the battery.&amp;nbsp; And then...nothing.&amp;nbsp; When I finally pick up Eldest, it&#39;s back home where she spends maybe 15 minutes replacing the battery &#45; taking into account learning how to use a ratchet set &#45; and then is off again.&amp;nbsp;
I could honestly have finished the job in less than 10 minutes but it&#39;s more important that Eldest learn how to handle these things in preparation for a future out of the household.&amp;nbsp; These are the kinds of things that most teens don&#39;t know and would wind up calling home about when they&#39;re off in the real world.&amp;nbsp; It takes more time and effort, assuring that I&#39;ve got things and that they&#39;re right so that I don&#39;t look like the village idiot, but teaching is ultimately one of the most important things that any father can do for their kids.</body>

<title>View From the Ridge, Part 2</title>
<body>There are moments and evenings that help you see the forest for the trees, as I noted some time ago, and tonight was one of those instances.&amp;nbsp; While things are busy with kids coming in and out &#45; many of&amp;nbsp;those who aren&#39;t ours&amp;nbsp;referring&amp;nbsp;to my wife and I as &amp;quot;Mom&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Dad&amp;quot; &#45; you get a sense of where you are in terms of life and parenting.
The kids tonight were friends of Eldest who are all leaving for college within the next three days, while she still has a year to go.&amp;nbsp; But the college visits are on the calendar and her own senior year is shaping up to be breathtaking in its rapidity.&amp;nbsp; Middle was upstairs hogging the phone and as the school year approaches, I tucked Youngest in earlier and curled up with him for a little while.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s now where we are &#45; the eldest with only a year remaining before college and the youngest still asking to be tucked in, but those bedtime days are waning and soon, he&#39;ll be big enough that he say goodnight and go up by himself and an almost two decade bedtime routine will be at an end.&amp;nbsp;
There were times in those years that I couldn&#39;t wait for that routine to end.&amp;nbsp; Friends talked about this hilarious show called Everybody Loves Raymond and I could never quite get to the television before the final credits rolled and while there&#39;s TiVo, it simply wasn&#39;t the same thing.&amp;nbsp; I never actually saw one of Ray Romano&#39;s episodes until it was in its seventh or eighth season.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, there were organizations that I didn&#39;t join because of involvement with kid&#45;related sports and scouting and geez, I couldn&#39;t make a meeting because of X, Y or Z.&amp;nbsp; Now that there&#39;s far, far fewer bedtimes than ever before, I find that I&#39;m going to miss them with their opportunities to giggle or chat with the kids,&amp;nbsp;listen to them breathe as they nod off, or even just awakening slightly refreshed after snoozing myself.
My father used to remark that that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be and the guy was correct.&amp;nbsp; Our job is to clothe, house, feed, teach and protect them until they&#39;re able to begin to start taking on some responsibilities themselves; they&#39;ll screw up &#45; as we did &#45; but they&#39;ll improve and learn and eventually, we&#39;ll be left once again to our own devices.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be.
In the press of things, remember to enjoy these days and keep some of them tucked away in your memory for later.&amp;nbsp;
For Ray Romano, there&#39;s cable and boxed sets of DVDs.&amp;nbsp; For these days however, there are only the memories.</body>

<title>The Bankers of Oz</title>
<body>The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the wizard, so he gave a large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner.&amp;nbsp; As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with wonder.&amp;nbsp; For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.&amp;nbsp; The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and cried out, &amp;quot;Who are you?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,&amp;quot; said the little man in a trembling voice.
&amp;nbsp;&#45; The Wizard of Oz, L. Frank Baum
Recently, Bloomberg News released an extensive online review of all of the various means of funneling funds to the financial sector by the Federal Reserve System.&amp;nbsp; They culled through almost 30000 pages of documents that the Federal Reserve fought to hide on various grounds, one of the principal rationales being that it would put those banks that used it at risk because of the perception that they were weak and would thus be unable to access the usual credit markets; they would then be prey to the circling vultures that hunted these poor creatures and as they dove on them, would destroy them in the market.&amp;nbsp; The report is eye&#45;opening, and much has been made of the extent to which the Federal Reserve served up billions to support foreign banks.&amp;nbsp;
Understand something about the data in this report.&amp;nbsp; In late 2008, there was&amp;nbsp;uproar over the $700 billion&amp;nbsp;TARP bill, which passed despite massive public opposition; the funds in this report&amp;nbsp;are entirely separate from TARP and are in addition to that funding.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;How?&amp;nbsp; Financial problems were arising in 2007 as the housing market began to decline and the Federal Reserve&amp;nbsp;began various funding mechanisms &#45; &#39;windows&#39; &#45; through which different entities could obtain exceedingly low&amp;nbsp;cost loans from the Fed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;These were&amp;nbsp;supposed to be collateralized with assets pledged by&amp;nbsp;the borrowing entities, but the process was dodgy since the collateral was questionable and at times, included common stock.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the problem with common stock?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The point of&amp;nbsp;collateral is that if the&amp;nbsp;borrower fails, there&#39;s something left of value to compensate the lender&amp;nbsp;but if the borrower fails, then their common stock itself is worthless.&amp;nbsp; If these banks had at least pledged toasters kept in the&amp;nbsp;backrooms for those of us who opened new accounts, the Fed would at least be able to furnish their lunchrooms with brand new toasters.&amp;nbsp;
But apart from the salaciousness of it all, so what?&amp;nbsp; What does it mean to some guy who&#39;s trying to raise kids and write a website for families?&amp;nbsp; How does it affect my little portion of the world and more importantly, how does it affect my parenting?

    First and foremost, we are now living in what one pundit referred to as a &amp;quot;corporate republic&amp;quot; in which vast amounts of money work to control society via the media.&amp;nbsp; Releasing this information could seriously damage banks and create even greater havoc than we endured when Lehman collapsed in late 2008.&amp;nbsp; And while this information dump doesn&#39;t pertain to TARP, the Treasury Secretary&#39;s comments to lawmakers certainly qualifies:&amp;nbsp; if we don&#39;t pass this bill, then there will be huge civil disorder and we&#39;ll have to declare martial law.&amp;nbsp; When you hear something, exercise your common sense and try to work through it to ascertain if it&#39;s really that bad.&amp;nbsp;
    On the heels of the corporate republic, it&#39;s the lesson that you shouldn&#39;t expect them to look out for you.&amp;nbsp; Ain&#39;t nobody doing that but you, sport, so you need to watch your spending and not get into debt for stupid reasons.
    When you read or hear something, understand that what you&#39;re hearing isn&#39;t the whole story and be ready to have to find the whole story.&amp;nbsp; When the Fed first opened these windows, the need was obvious but the entire mechanism was downplayed by the Fed as to how extensive the use would be.&amp;nbsp; As the movie version&#39;s line goes, Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
    Follow the money.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Businesses exist for one reason only and if the owner hasn&#39;t got a clue of&amp;nbsp;who you are when you&#39;re&amp;nbsp;talking to him, then they&#39;re less likely to give a damn about your life.
    Don&#39;t believe everything&amp;nbsp;that&#39;s said to you, and this is one that I&#39;ll be touching on in the next several days with the older kids.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Who&#39;s saying it and how much would they really know?&amp;nbsp; Underlings are&amp;nbsp;sometimes like mushrooms since it&#39;s best to leave them in the dark and&amp;nbsp;cover them with&amp;nbsp;lots of dung.&amp;nbsp; When the TARP took effect, I had a conversation with the branch manager of our bank and according to that person, yes, we took a little bit of that money because we were advised to do so and we&#39;ve since paid it back in entirety.&amp;nbsp; That was over two years ago and when I reviewed this Bloomsberg report the other night, I found that my bank had been tied to the Fed via one of the windows and were carrying a loan balance through this program for an average of 400 days.&amp;nbsp; So right about the time that I talked with the manager, my bank was tapped into the Fed window for survival money.

Ultimately, it goes back to a recurrent paternal theme with my children, and that&#39;s to encourage a questioning and skeptical nature&amp;nbsp;as they age.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not something that I ever expected to do as I held them through the night, but events no longer leave any choice.</body>

<title>The Little Things - Bathtime Songs</title>
<body>It&#39;s sometimes the little things that truly stay with the kids as they age.&amp;nbsp; They might be drawings that you make for them or games that you play and my case, it&#39;s the bathtub songs that helped me work with them through washing.&amp;nbsp;
Kids respond to music and tunes and simply having a small song for something that has to be done &amp;quot;makes the medicine go down&amp;quot; far easier.&amp;nbsp; In my case, I would mess with the kids from when they were babies and I had to wash them in the bathtub and soon developed a series of songs that I sang when a new phase of the job had to happen.&amp;nbsp; There was a ditty about cleaning the bottom, a knock&#45;off of Figaro for the hair&#45;washing, and a Doo&#45;Wop tune for drying off with the towel; these were things that I sang to them each night as I bathed them and only stopped when they were old enough to clean themselves.&amp;nbsp; I haven&#39;t sung them in years as Youngest has long since been able to handle cleaning himself.
Twice in the past week &#45; once in the car and again at dinner tonight &#45; I&#39;ve chatted with the two older kids and found that they can recite and sing the doggerel bathtub songs that I sang to them when they were very young.&amp;nbsp; In the first instance, Middle actually sang harmony as I sang it for him again while driving the other evening.&amp;nbsp; The second occurred at dinner tonight as all three were present and each remembered all of the songs (although Youngest didn&#39;t recall as well, a function of my not bathing him as often as my wife).&amp;nbsp; I was stunned at the laughter as they recounted the tunes and the verses and could only think that it&#39;s the little things.
Kids don&#39;t need all kinds of toys or things, but they do need you.&amp;nbsp; Find something &#45; anything &#45; that you can make your own with them and then do it again, and again, and again.&amp;nbsp; This is what the kids need, and want, more than anything else to connect with you, your time and attention.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Primer on Interest Rates</title>
<body>Congratulations, interest rates are now as low as they&#39;ve been since when Ike was President as the interest rate yield on the 10 year Treasury note&amp;nbsp;blipped below 2% on August 18, 2011.&amp;nbsp; 2%.&amp;nbsp; 2%.&amp;nbsp; 2%.&amp;nbsp; The most appropriate response&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;genteelly texted as WTF?&amp;nbsp; But to get a flavor of what that actually means, you have to have a sense of what interest rates used to look like before the Federal Reserve System began altering the rate&#39;s genetic code, such as just done by the scientist who gave an alligator snout to a chick in utero.
The interest rate was once the prime food source for those who were looking for a steady income stream, whether they were banks or the elderly who were no longer in the work force.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s true nutrition lay in the meaty, rich segment known as the real return and that in turn was protected by relatively thick layers that fended off the rate&#39;s principal predators, risk and inflation.&amp;nbsp; Since the rate&#39;s capture and subsequent alteration, the banks have been forced to find other ways to boost their income stream while the elderly have sometimes had to rely on their alternate food source, cat food.
There are even different breeds of interest rates and how they respond to the twin predators, risk and inflation.&amp;nbsp; All of them are wary of inflation and the longer&#45;term bonds are not only more nervous, but also typically have much larger inflation layers to protect the real rate.&amp;nbsp; The government bonds are less concerned about risk than their corporate brethren, which have significantly larger risk layers as a result.&amp;nbsp; All of the rate breeds get more nervous when the economy is uncertain but the short term government breed responds like a St Bernard while the 30 year corporate and junk breeds are&amp;nbsp;chihuahuas on a meth bender.
Snark and foolishness aside, there are some things to understand when you hear about interest rates and yields.&amp;nbsp; Understand this:&amp;nbsp; while everyone hears about the stock market and equities, the reality is that they&#39;re a sideshow to the bond market&#39;s main stage, upon which rests the various national debts and the supporting currencies.&amp;nbsp; James Carville once remarked that when he died, he wanted to come back as the bond market.
James Carville was right.
What is an Interest Rate?
Interest rates are nothing more than the cost of borrowing money, much as you&#39;d pay Days Inn for the cost of using their room for a night or Hertz for the cost of that rental car during vacation.&amp;nbsp; Borrow from me and it will cost you perhaps 3 or 4 or 17 cents for every dollar that you use.&amp;nbsp; It could be 3, 4 or 17 cents depending upon any of the components that typically comprise interest rates.
Interest Rate Components
Historically, interest rates are composed of three segments.&amp;nbsp;

    The first is the real return and this is generally what the lender would like to see as a true return for lending the money to a borrower for using his money.&amp;nbsp; It is a function of the lender&#39;s preferences and also what other uses he might have for the money.&amp;nbsp; Hey, if I can&#39;t get at least 4% real return on my money, then what&#39;s the point of lending it?&amp;nbsp; I can use it for my own purposes.&amp;nbsp;
    The second component is that which pays the lender for what she assesses as the risk of the return of the money and it&#39;s here that the ubiquitous credit scores come into play.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;ve been bankrupt like Trump or planning to spend the money on a risky private space exploration company and you&#39;re liable to find that the lenders are going to ask for a higher interest rate to compensate them and this will be tacked onto the real return that the lender wants.&amp;nbsp; Historically, interest rates are&amp;nbsp;generally higher&amp;nbsp;as you go further out since there&#39;s greater uncertainty as to what&#39;s going to happen and that&#39;s why the&amp;nbsp;48 month CD rate pays you a generous 1.0% versus the .3% on the 6 month CD.&amp;nbsp;
    The third component is the segment that compensates the lender for what they anticipate the rate of inflation is going to be.&amp;nbsp; Bonds pay at a constant rate and that is consequently eroded over time by inflation, which eats away at the purchasing power of the currency.&amp;nbsp; If you know that you&#39;re going to be repaid $1000/month over the next ten years, then you certainly want to assure that there&#39;s some extra sweetener since $1000/month won&#39;t buy in ten years what it buys now.

So the interest rates that you knew in the past were comprised of each of the three elements together.&amp;nbsp; When rates spiked in the early 1980s, that was a function of the Federal Reserve driving rates up with a healthy inflation premium to combat the effects of inflation rippling through the country at that time.&amp;nbsp; If you miss a credit card payment and the rate is raised, that&#39;s a function of the bank&#39;s response to what they perceive as the increased risk that you&#39;ll default and walk away; the amount of the rate increase is certainly debatable but the rationale behind it isn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp;
Yield
When you hear about the yield on a particular type of bond, you&#39;re hearing about the interest rate of the actual return on what was paid for the bond when it was actually purchased on the market.
Bonds all have coupon rates stating that they&#39;ll pay $X per each month or year and the face value of the bond is the amount that will be paid off when the bond reaches maturity.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, a company issuing new debt might agree to pay $400/year for 15 years on a bond with a face value of $10000 so the stated rate of the bond is 4% annually ($400/10000).&amp;nbsp; But let&#39;s say that the bond buyers believe that in the next 15 years, inflation is going to run at a rate of 5%/year so there&#39;s actually a 1% loss of purchasing power to the holder of this 4% piece of dogfood.&amp;nbsp; The company needs the money and the sale goes through; where the adjustment occurs is in what folks are willing to pay for the loss of purchasing power and that&#39;s the bond&#39;s face value.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll lose 1% annually over 15&amp;nbsp; years?&amp;nbsp; Meh, I&#39;ll bid $8500 for it and if I can get the $10000 for $8500, then that&#39;s good enough for me.&amp;nbsp; The actual interest rate yield on the bond is consequently 4.7% ($400/8500).&amp;nbsp; The annual bond payments are still $400 but the bondholder paid less for the bond and that&#39;s the value on which the yield is calculated.
The takeaway from the bond market is this:&amp;nbsp; bond yields are inverse to bond prices and bond prices are a function of supply and demand.&amp;nbsp; Yields drop because prices paid for bonds rise and vice versa.&amp;nbsp; If the yield on a particular class of bonds drops, then that&#39;s because folks are willing to pay something extra for that bond.&amp;nbsp;
How Are Interest Rates Set?
That&#39;s a hard question because it&#39;s an interplay between the Federal Reserve and the generalized market.&amp;nbsp; Understand one thing, first.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s constant, constant lending going on between banks and investment houses on any given day as these entities are all shifting liquidity back and forth to cover their needs and many of these are lending to one another on an extremely short term basis with what appears to be minisculely at&amp;nbsp;low rates &#45; until you understand that these rates are on amounts often in the millions and for that day alone.&amp;nbsp; But these have to be predicated upon some standard and for the United States, that standard is the Fed Funds rate, the base interest rate at which banks lend to one another or borrow from the Federal Reserve for their everyday needs.&amp;nbsp; Presently, the Fed Funds rate is a whopping .25%, which means that banks have an extraordinarily cheap source of funds and the idea is that as the Fed Funds rate is adjusted one direction or another by the Federal Reserve, this will provide some guidance on where rates are supposed to go in the rest of the credit markets.
Which is great unless you&#39;ve got a credit card at 11%+ &amp;nbsp;interest, but&amp;nbsp;that&#39;s not the purview of government regulation, which would&amp;nbsp;be wrong.&amp;nbsp;
The Island of Doctor Bernanke (and his sidekick, Igor Geithner)
What&#39;s written above is a short and simplistic view of how things are supposed to work.&amp;nbsp; Our situation however, is that there&#39;s so much debt overhanging everything that Dr. Bernanke &#45; he&#39;s a Ph.D &#45; has had to tinker with the interest rates in order to try to keep things afloat.&amp;nbsp; The hope now is that the easy money policy will somehow flush through the economy and create inflation so that the massive debts are covered by devalued dollars.&amp;nbsp; How has he done that?

    First by removing the ability to assess risk.&amp;nbsp; When the financial sector understood that it wouldn&#39;t suffer from it&#39;s mistakes and also had access to historically cheap credit, there was no impetus to monitor their lending; this resulted in all manner of bad loans for which they accepted the fees but ultimately never the loss.&amp;nbsp; As low as mortgage rates were in the height of the housing bubble, you can argue that the lack of risk was passed along to the homebuyer with the compression of the risk segment of the interest rate.
    Working with the Government, the inflation portion has been gamed with reporting of the CPI, particularly when decisions are based upon the core&#45;CPI, which consists of apparently everything from xBoxes to sneakers &#45; but not food and fuel.&amp;nbsp; When the Fed Funds rate is based upon inflationary expectations&amp;nbsp;that are managed instead of actually reported, then those who depend upon interest for income suffers.&amp;nbsp; The elderly who live on their savings and Social Security will see their buying power eroded as the inflation segment of&amp;nbsp;interest rates&amp;nbsp;is eviscerated while inflation begins to&amp;nbsp;rise for food and fuel, pretty much what they&amp;nbsp;use instead of xBoxes and sneakers.

How badly has the interest&amp;nbsp;rate system been screwed because of these factors?
The fact that yields on the 10 year government note pierced below 2% meant that buyers wanted&amp;nbsp;the safety of&amp;nbsp;government bonds in hard&amp;nbsp;times and were willing to accept 2%;&amp;nbsp; the expectation is that&amp;nbsp;we&#39;re looking at a significant recession with deflation&amp;nbsp;facing us as in the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; That same day however, the yield on the 5 year TIPS note &#45; which is adjusted for inflation so that the holder gets payments that adjust upwards for inflation &#45; actually went negative.&amp;nbsp; In other words, people were actually willing to pay so much for the inflation adjusted bond that they bid the price up to the point that the yield was less than 0%.&amp;nbsp; And that is something that is rarely ever seen.
Congratulations, Dr Bernanke.&amp;nbsp; Your experiments&amp;nbsp;on the poor interest rate have effectively made the bond market totally schizophrenic.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to the 21st century, where gene&#45;splicing meets economics.

<title>Kids Clothing:&nbsp; How Much is Enough?</title>
<body>With school &#45; Dad, don&#39;t say that word! &#45; rapidly approaching, one of my tasks is to cull through the upcoming Autumn and Winter clothing to see what&#39;s available and what is needed.&amp;nbsp; This no longer happens with Eldest, who&#39;s through growing and whose female fashion is off&#45;limits to Dad but it does happen with her younger brothers, who are far from finished with their growth.&amp;nbsp; The process will start with Youngest and after inventorying what&#39;s there and making space, I&#39;ll move on to Middle; what he&#39;s outgrown will then shift downwards to the little brother.&amp;nbsp; But when I recently glanced at the closet and drawers of one of the boys, I wondered how much does this kid really need?&amp;nbsp; How much do any of us actually need?
I remember my own father tossing out that rhetorical question decades ago as he watched my mother bringing in the shopping bags with back&#45;to&#45;school clothing for my sister and I.&amp;nbsp; He was a Depression child and could probably count his items of clothing on two hands and nowadays, I myself don&#39;t recall having so much clothing in my closet and dresser.&amp;nbsp; But he wanted his children to dress decently and wasn&#39;t going to poach on his wife&#39;s domain as domestic engineer.&amp;nbsp; Some years ago, I took the kids to the barber/stylist and he chatted about his own childhood in the 1950s with them.&amp;nbsp; What struck them, I learned afterwards, was that he lived in what he described as a decent neighborhood and shared his bedroom with his brothers and that each of them had a dresser drawer in which to keep all of their clothing.&amp;nbsp; A single dresser drawer?&amp;nbsp; They all shared the closet?&amp;nbsp; Huh?
So what happened between the 1950s, the 1980s and now?&amp;nbsp; If you think about it, it&#39;s a reflection of what we did to our industrial sector and our fellow citizens as we pursued globalization.
Regardless of what else you might think of the 1950s and 1960s, it was a period of a strong American livable wage.&amp;nbsp; Families could afford decent housing, transportation and food with money left over for savings and the discretionary items &#45; the items &#45; that made life more enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; It was also during this period that the American appetite for discretionary items really began to take off, as spending for non&#45;necessities, as a percentage of income&amp;nbsp;rose from 32% in 1950 to 35% in 1960 enroute to 48% in 1985.&amp;nbsp; While spending was ginning up in the growth of the consumer culture, overseas manufacturing was also ginning up in places ranging from Japan to Indonesia, Korea and ultimately, China.&amp;nbsp; The push was on, with far lower labor costs, for greater consumption of fashion both in clothing and footwear and retailers provided all manner of sales and advertising.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been in the past two decades that Walmart has become the king of cheap clothing as they&#39;ve flooded the American market with inexpensive clothing.
Business news organs would periodically chronicle the departure of the American textile industry but this was largely unnoticed by most Americans except for the 1970s union commercials.&amp;nbsp; In these brief ads, women dressed as blue collar factory workers would slowly gather as they sang Look for the Union label...It was a sad and doomed effort to encourage Americans to support their fellow citizens, but against the constant barrage of sales advertising, was as effective as a squirt gun at a three&#45;alarmer.&amp;nbsp; Now, my son&#39;s closet and drawers are full of clothing and while it&#39;s too late at night to check them, I guarantee that 99% of it is imported.&amp;nbsp; Yes, it&#39;s cheap and there&#39;s lots of it, we being good Americans, but all of that money has gone to a multinational corporation that pays pennies on the dollar to foreign laborers.&amp;nbsp; We have effectively gutted ourselves and sold out entire towns in the southern United States and I&#39;ve been part and parcel of that tragedy.
So just how much does he need?&amp;nbsp; Where does it need to come from?
First, I won&#39;t do to him what I won&#39;t do to myself, so earlier this week, I gutted my own dresser as I downsized from five drawers to two and a half of both summer and winter shirts and short pants.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow, I&#39;ll do the same to my own closet as I cull out the weak and the lame, leaving only the survivors.
Second, I anticipate that he&#39;ll be left with probably a half dozen solely&#45;for&#45;play summer shirts and a few more that can be worn for school.&amp;nbsp; The same will go for winter wear, including one or two sweaters and a pair of good khakis or navy blue dress slacks.
Third, I&#39;ll start searching for clothing in the upcoming sizes that are made in the US and as he outgrows the existing and I have to replace them, I&#39;ll purchase the domestically made.&amp;nbsp; While the cost per item is liable to be higher, the flip side is that having to purchase fewer items should mean a zero&#45;net difference and the money will go to American labor.&amp;nbsp; This is provided that I can find it.
The final advantages of this approach will mean smaller loads of laundry and fewer piles of clothing waiting for dispersal to the various drawers.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, less money will wind up being wasted on clothing that simply takes up drawer or closet space as it loses out to the more favorite articles that are constantly being worn to the point of threadbare.
Our children learn from our own habits as they grow and observe us.&amp;nbsp; If we&#39;re to make these kinds of changes in our economic habits, then it will be easier for them when they&#39;re older and the reality is that we&#39;re going to have to change.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Corporations are People.&nbsp; Or Are They?</title>
<body>It&#39;s frankly too early to pay much attention to the speeches of potential candidates, but I was taken aback by the recent comment of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney: &amp;nbsp;Corporations are people. &amp;nbsp;After a mental double&#45;take, I sat and considered his comment since he&#39;s liable to be the next Republican candidate for 2012. &amp;nbsp;Technically, he&#39;s correct on multiple counts since a corporation is a legal entity formed by people and employing people for the purpose of making money. &amp;nbsp;Additionally, the United States Supreme Court ruled as far back as 1886 that a corporation had legal standing as a person (Santa Clara County v Southern Pacific) and even recently ruled that campaign finance restrictions were actually a muzzling of Corporate America&#39;s First Amendment rights, which so far as I&#39;m concerned is proof that enough money can buy phenomenal legal representation.
But for all of the technical points, Mitt Romney is horrendously wrong.&amp;nbsp; Mitt sees a Hollywood ingenue while we see Gloria Swanson dripping in mascara and powder to hide the wrinkles and age.
His comments might be sincere and I can even understand why he might believe that given his family history. Mitt Romney is the son of a blue&#45;blood republican and 1968 republican presidential candidate, George Romney, who was himself a former governor of Michigan. &amp;nbsp;But prior to that political post in the early&#45;mid 1960s, he was the president of the now&#45;defunct American Motors Corporation; in the 1950s, he brought that automobile company back against the GM and Ford behemoths on the back of the spunky little Rambler. &amp;nbsp;George Romney was a corporate man, through and through and was also a Mormon who spent time proselytizing in the British Isles, so there&#39;s a particular solidity to his moral beliefs. &amp;nbsp;His son consequently grew up in an environment in which the American corporation was a beneficent and powerful entity which employed thousands of people, it&#39;s effectiveness proven by the industrial might of the Second World War and its aftermath.
If you read Tom Brokaw&#39;s The Greatest Generation or Studs Terkel&#39;s The Good War, one of the&amp;nbsp;recurrent themes is that the Second World War served as a great equalizer amongst American society so that the Wall Street executive&#39;s son served in combat just as the son of the steelworker. &amp;nbsp;While there was certainly a difference between the pay of the American CEO and his typical employee, it was only 24 times the average worker&#39;s wage in 1965 but by 1980 had grown to 42 times the average wage.&amp;nbsp; The most recent results show that this income differential has risen by 2010 to a stunning 343 times the average worker&#39;s wage of $33,900 annually.&amp;nbsp; The large majority of this pay is via the stock options granted in the executive contracts instead of actual wages; there&#39;s consequent incentive to focus on the stock price.&amp;nbsp; Through the ensuing decades, that sense of common cause faded as the generation retired and younger generations with increasingly shorter&#45;term sensibilities took over the reins.&amp;nbsp;
If the American corporation is people, just how many actually prosper and share the wealth?&amp;nbsp; More importantly, how many have had their jobs sacrificed on the altar of globalization to maintain profits?&amp;nbsp; To say that the corporation is composed of people implies a certain common leveling, but how many of those who decided to outsource actually outsourced their own position?&amp;nbsp; Gee, Bob, we&#39;ve got to cut costs so we&#39;re moving your position to Indonesia and since we&#39;re all in this together, I&#39;m cutting my position as well.
The American corporation as a benign group of Joe Six&#45;Packs?&amp;nbsp; Complete bullshit.&amp;nbsp; American corporate management bears some responsibility for the hollowing of American manufacturing and the difficulties facing the American middle class as they increasingly shortened the timeframe of their decisions and viewed people as commodities instead of assets.
As for me, I come by my anti&#45;corporate stance honestly.&amp;nbsp; My father&#39;s corporate job put food on my family&#39;s table when I was a child and a roof over my head and my first real job was in a large insurance corporation.&amp;nbsp; My last job however, was in the corporate headquarters of the now defunct MCI.&amp;nbsp; On one afternoon, multiple senior staff were discussing the results of meetings amongst the senior financial executives and how they were looking for ways to help boost the share price of an already profitable company.&amp;nbsp; One of the plans being discussed was to show the market their seriousness by cutting costs, including the closure of several midwest call centers.&amp;nbsp; Understand something about how MCI kept their labor costs low; they would set up call centers in rural areas which had suffered some economic hardship, purchasing and renovating a warehouse or closed store in which to house the folks who were actually calling you to sell the &amp;quot;Friends and Family&amp;quot; and other telephone products.&amp;nbsp; Because I had to periodically fly to exotic locales like Sioux City, Iowa and Springfield, Missouri, I can tell you that these people were working to pay off student loans, get health insurance and put food on the table.&amp;nbsp; This appalling concept helped me to understand that I was nothing more than a cog that would be willingly sacrificed to the greater glory of Earnings Per Share.&amp;nbsp; When we found that my wife was pregnant, it was certainly one of my thoughts as I decided to resign and stay home with the baby.&amp;nbsp;
Not all corporations are evil and not all executives deserve castration, although that too is increasingly irrelevant in light of more women in management.&amp;nbsp; But America has become too beholden to the corporations that purchase votes and public image in the pursuit of short&#45;term and pyrrhic profits and when it&#39;s time to actually consider the political alternatives, I&#39;m going to remember Mitt&#39;s mistaken sentiment and ill&#45;considered remarks.

<category>Basics for Dads</category>
<title>Yes, Dad, It&#8217;s Okay to&#8230;</title>
<body>...tell your child that something they&#39;re wearing makes them look ridiculous.
...tell your child that you love them, whether girl or boy.&amp;nbsp; Kids&amp;nbsp;need to hear&amp;nbsp;more of the corrections&amp;nbsp;for them to learn &#45; which can be tough on&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;ego &#45; and knowing that they&#39;re loved will at least take some of the sting out of it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s probably something you should tell me more than anything else and as I write this, I&#39;m realizing that I don&#39;t do it enough.
...tell your child that what they&#39;ve done is bad or dumb.&amp;nbsp; Many adults no longer want to take the time and effort to do so for fear of offending or upsetting the parent, which means that&amp;nbsp; the kid isn&#39;t going to hear unless you deliver it.&amp;nbsp; As I&#39;ve told any of my own kids on any number of occasions for a smart kid, that was an incredibly stupid thing to do.&amp;nbsp; You know better than that.
...take action about the bad, dumb or poorly done thing.&amp;nbsp; There are consequences to behavior and sheer stupidity and it&#39;s not going to damage them to get called up short and it &amp;nbsp;could frankly save their lives.
...tell your child that he can do better.&amp;nbsp; That said, be ready to provide concrete and hard details as to deficiencies&amp;nbsp;and then be ready to assist with how to improve; surprisingly, many kids will appreciate it.&amp;nbsp; As one teen once told me, when I want praise on something that I&#39;ve done for school, I take it to my mother.&amp;nbsp; Then I take it to my father to see what needs to be improved.
...raise your voice and/or speak sternly to your child.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Many fathers don&#39;t realize that their voice is a valuable disciplinary tool&amp;nbsp;that can be used to help maintain some order and discipline before things get completely out of hand.
...tell your child that it&#39;s time to move on to something else, especially in terms of dealing with the electronics.&amp;nbsp; Kids typically have no sense of when to stop and electronics, particularly games, aren&#39;t designed to help develop that so it&#39;s up to the parents to say enough.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had to really work on handling the resulting whining that accompanies such a directive and I still have testy moments, but kids need to do more than just sit in front of a screen.
...squelch your child when they&#39;re older and frankly, the teen ego sometimes needs it in order to be brought back into line.
...take privileges away even when they&#39;re older.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll survive without the car, cellphone and iPod for a period of time.&amp;nbsp; That said, it&#39;s usually helpful to lay out such a prospect with the original groundrules so that you don&#39;t come off as arbitrary and capricious.&amp;nbsp; I expect you home by 10 pm and if there&#39;s a problem, contact me immediately.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re late without contacting me, then you lose the use of the car for the next two days/the trip to the beach with the Jones family/the cellphone for a week/whatever works in the situation...
...talk and share information with the parents of your child&#39;s peers.&amp;nbsp; Kids and teens usually hate it when parents want to call other parents because it appears to limit their independence and at the worst, prevents them from conspiring to do something phenomenally stupid.&amp;nbsp; But a brief chat at least eases some of the angst and reassures that there are others who also pay attention and try to monitor what&#39;s happening.&amp;nbsp; My son and his friend, Opie, were embarrassed when the boy&#39;s father came to our front door to meet me one evening before his son&#39;s first sleepover at our house.&amp;nbsp; I frankly appreciated it and could easily defend it to the two boys, who grumbled afterwards, and thoroughly understand why that father did what he did.&amp;nbsp; Thank God, I&#39;m not alone here.
...ask about what adults are overseeing things and nix plans when you&#39;re not comfortable.&amp;nbsp; Hell, I did it last week.&amp;nbsp; Stupidity is contagious and in an adolescent brain, one of the last things to mature is that part which controls judgment and risk assessment.</body>

<title>Let the Kid Decide?</title>
<body>When is it appropriate to let the child make a decision of importance?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fairly clear that as the parent, I have the final say in whether something happens or not, but when and how do I start to let the kid make some important decisions of his own?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the most critical decision of a teen&#39;s life is what happens after high school and if there&#39;s no experience there because the &#39;rents make all the decisions, then what happens?
The question raised it&#39;s head &#45; again &#45; with Youngest, who&#39;s entering fourth grade.&amp;nbsp; He was playing right field on a local little league all&#45;star team in a double&#45;elimination tournament several weeks ago, and the team was forced to play four games in four straight July days with no breaks.&amp;nbsp; He came off the field at the end of the first game, limping, and we noticed a limp after the second game as well.&amp;nbsp; By the afternoon before the third game, he came up to me limping and we treated it immediately with ice and ibuprofen; that third game went well for his bat but again, he came home with a slight limp.&amp;nbsp; Because this was now the fourth game in four straight days, our plan was to have a quiet day with a lot of rest and that&#39;s the way the day went.&amp;nbsp; The problem arose, however, during the pregame warmups as he was shagging fly balls in the outfield and as I watched, I could see &#45; in a single instant &#45; when the look on his face showed that something had definitely gone wrong.&amp;nbsp; Since the coach was still busy with the other outfielders, he limped over to me and said that the knee hurt too bad to play.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s be frank about what went through my mind.&amp;nbsp; The team only fielded ten players for nine positions, so there was no bench of which to speak and where would leave the rest of the team in 90+ degree heat?&amp;nbsp; Should I pull the Knute Rockne/Vince Lombardi take one for the team speech?&amp;nbsp; Honestly, what are people going to think of the boy for not going through and of me as well?&amp;nbsp;
As I looked at him, I quickly considered that I&#39;d seen him play in the past&amp;nbsp;with blistered feet and a shiner from taking a ball in the face.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d also been limping for three straight days with no qualms and while 98% of kids whine about little things, he&#39;d come through some big ones without a whine.&amp;nbsp; As we talked with the coach, his options were to play in entirety, not at all or at least play for two innings and then sit.&amp;nbsp; The boy was clear that he couldn&#39;t play and when I briefly revisited the question again, he was certain that he could no longer play.&amp;nbsp; The other aspect is that this is a child who&#39;s playing for love of the&amp;nbsp;game.&amp;nbsp; While there&#39;s certainly responsibility to the team, there&#39;s also a responsibility to&amp;nbsp;protect that love of the game.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no pay and to make a 9 year old play through even worse pain when he&#39;s clearly played through some already would only damage that desire to play further.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I looked at the coach and confirmed what the boy said and like that, he was on the bench with ice on his knee.
So how do you handle such a situation?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a fine line between understanding when to demand more of the kids and when to step back.&amp;nbsp; How do they respond to pressure?&amp;nbsp; What else is at stake for the options?&amp;nbsp; Are they prone to needless whining?&amp;nbsp; If they actually get their way, are they giving up something else that they obviously like?&amp;nbsp; Life can be damned hard and what our kids will have to face in the future is likely to be harder than ours and we do a disservice by letting them slide or coddling them.&amp;nbsp; The kids learn that they can manipulate us to avoid unpleasant situations and once they&#39;re in the world, they&#39;ll run into someone who is going to hand them their heads.&amp;nbsp; Yet if we repeatedly force the situation, then they&#39;re defeated and learn that they have no ability to make an independent decision; there&#39;s value in learning how to make a decision.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d like to enumerate any number of easily remembered bulletpoints, but it simply comes down to your own sense of the child and the situation at hand.&amp;nbsp; And like many times with children, there are probably going to be miscalls &#45; and God&amp;nbsp; knows that I&#39;ve made them.
As of now, Youngest is out of all running and impact sports for the near future as the orthopod to whom he was referred found legitimate damage to the knee.&amp;nbsp; The kid made the right call and frankly, I&#39;m proud of how he handled the situation.&amp;nbsp; But that doesn&#39;t mean that he gets a pass for the household chores.

<title>Toast and Blessing:&nbsp; Public Praise of the Kids</title>
<body>The knock on men is that we&#39;re typically uncommunicative and insensitive, whether with our mates or our kids, and this is especially the case with public praise.&amp;nbsp; It might stem from uncertainty of knowing what to say, but more likely from a fear of sounding too sentimental or simply dumb.&amp;nbsp; But the kids want your approval &#45; certainly private if not public &#45; and there are very few children who don&#39;t want to hear it.&amp;nbsp; When we fathers pass on these rare opportunities, we&#39;re forgetting the Principal Law of Fatherhood&amp;nbsp;&#45; that it&#39;s no longer about us &#45; and doing a real disservice to our children.
If you doubt the impact and value of these moments, I wish that you could have witnessed such a moment at a graduation party that I recently attended.&amp;nbsp; The party was to celebrate the high school graduation of a young man, the last child in his immediate family.&amp;nbsp; After time for visiting and eating, the father approached the front of the room and took a microphone, at which time the crowd grew quiet.&amp;nbsp; After thanking everyone for attending, he told the young man that he had a few words for his benefit.&amp;nbsp; The son advanced to the forefront of the crowd and stood directly and attentively before his father as the older man withdrew a simple index card from his shirt pocket.&amp;nbsp;
The father read from the card in an unadorned style with no apparent deviation from what he&#39;d penned earlier.&amp;nbsp; What he&#39;d written was straightforward and simple but the content of his message had a noticeable impact upon his son, who perceptibly&amp;nbsp;straightened as he listened.&amp;nbsp; The words were a combination of blessing and toast, an acknowledgement of his passage into manhood and the pride felt for the man that he&#39;d both become and into which he would continue to grow.&amp;nbsp; It concluded with a few short words of simple and heartfelt advice.&amp;nbsp; The remarks probably lasted no more than two minutes but the brevity didn&#39;t detract in any way.&amp;nbsp; For the young man, the effect was clear.&amp;nbsp; He walked forward at the conclusion and swept his father into a bearhug that caused the older man&amp;nbsp;to stumble and recover before the two of them collapsed in a heap.&amp;nbsp;
Children, whether boy or girl, crave the attention and affection of their fathers and such a public proclamation of love &#45; and respect &#45; will carry the youngster a long way, no matter what road is chosen.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a practice based upon ancient traditions when the parent would finally acknowledge that the children who they&#39;d raised were now adults and equals, deserving of their own respect outside of the family shadow.&amp;nbsp; When I left for college decades ago, my own father wrote a long letter that he packed into my trunk, to be found when I unpacked.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d long ago decided that such a communication would go to each of my own children, but watching this event has me rethinking the format of the message.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps I&#39;ll have to work up the courage to seize such a moment&amp;nbsp; as it appears in the future.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Debt Ceiling and Default:&nbsp; Who&#8217;s Paid First</title>
<body>This isn&#39;t the type of website that tracks closely to the news, but this reported leak by the Administration bears notice.&amp;nbsp;
A recent post was about some commentary that I&#39;m hearing from people to the effect that a federal default might not be such a terrible thing and one of my own observations was that come the early August period, there would still be money to pay some bills.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The government would then be in the position of more than a few average Americans, who have to prioritize their bills and decide what gets paid first.&amp;nbsp; One of my great interests would be who gets paid with the available funds and who gets stiffed.
Bloomberg is now running a report by an unnamed Administration official that if the debt ceiling is not raised, then the Treasury Department would assure that the bondholders &#45; frequently foreign creditors and the banking system via the Federal Reserve System &#45; would receive payment ahead of others.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, I&#39;m not certain whether there&#39;s legislation that mandates that bond payments supersede other payments but the simple reality is that the US government will&amp;nbsp;give precedence to creditors who own US bonds which mature during that period.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, it doesn&#39;t matter even if such legislation exists because the government should never have reached this ridiculous state of affairs.&amp;nbsp; This might simply be a leak to ratchet up pressure upon the Congress, whose members will hopefully fear that the public will blame them for all manner of missed benefits.&amp;nbsp; But it points out two salient things:

    The administration refused as recently as a month ago to specify any order of payments, which they apparently now think makes a major difference in whether some compromise &#45; meaningful or not &#45; is reached.
    The US government has officially placed the American people on notice that bondholders and creditors will be given priority over the citizenry.&amp;nbsp;

So there it is.&amp;nbsp; If you want the government to give a damn, make sure that you lend them some money beyond your taxes.</body>

<title>A Public Service Announcement:&nbsp; The Debt Ceiling Debate</title>
<body>If anybody is curious about the actual status of the Debt Ceiling debate, I&#39;m enclosing a link to the site for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.&amp;nbsp; The site has been in existence since August 2010 and they help to parse out the briar thicket that is the federal budget for those of us in the general public.&amp;nbsp; The article is a brief synopsis of the similarities and differences between the plan promoted by House Speaker John Boehner (R &#45; OH) and Senator Harry Reid (D &#45; NV).&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s nothing from the President since frankly, the guy&#39;s got bupkis.
http://crfb.org/blogs/comparing&#45;reid&#45;and&#45;boehner&#45;proposals
The topic is one that&#39;s gotten some conversation in the house since the prospect of a federal default is increasing daily and it will most certainly be painful for the rest of us should it happen.
And now back to life.

<title>Teens and Independence:&nbsp; Balance</title>
<body>Kids grow and expand their circles and frankly, that&#39;s what I want to see happen.&amp;nbsp; But letting them experience some independence is an area painted with a large swath of gray; there are still plenty of ways that things&amp;nbsp;can go wrong and just because I&#39;m letting them have some freedom doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;ve stepped back completely.&amp;nbsp; How much information is a parent entitled to and is there any off&#45;limits behaviors on the parents&#39; part?&amp;nbsp; What should my guidelines be?
Years ago, I spoke with a friend whose kids were already teens while mine were either in pull&#45;ups or early elementary school.&amp;nbsp; Caught in the daily rush of providing physically intensive, high&#45;touch care to three children, I told her that I envied her now that her kids were in middle and high school and able to take care of themselves.&amp;nbsp; I would love to not have that constant demand.&amp;nbsp; It would be a huge decrease in the daily pressure of small kids.&amp;nbsp; Her response was surprising since she actually missed those days; the pressure, she stated, is still there but now it&#39;s just different and I worry more than I did before.&amp;nbsp; Our conversation veered on to other topics but the remark has stayed with me and as my kids are now further along in the age pipeline, I can appreciate what she&#39;s saying.&amp;nbsp; Where are they at the particular moment, who are they with, what are they doing and are there any parents nearby to monitor what&#39;s happening?
Spending my teen years in the 1970s &#45; yes, I&#39;m middle&#45;aged! &#45; meant that there wasn&#39;t the Wild West of the internet and more likely than not, having a parent who was home and able to keep tabs on what was happening.&amp;nbsp; In the introduction to the reissue of his Summer of Night, author Dan Simmons writes about his perceived difference between the life of a 12 year old boy in 1961&#39;s Elm Haven and such a life today.&amp;nbsp; He recalls a life of freedom from the post&#45;breakfast hours to late afternoon as kids would hit the bikes and head out throughout their hometown; the contrast is with today and the fear that either something&amp;nbsp; bad will befall the boy or else he&#39;s going to fall into a life of crime and delinquency without constant oversight and structure.&amp;nbsp; From my recollection, growing up in a rural Pennsylvania was akin to Simmons&#39; fictitious Elm Haven and to an extent, I agree with Simmons&#39; premise.
There was a major difference between the rural 1970s and today, however and that is the presence of a parent to keep tabs&amp;nbsp;on the kids and activities.&amp;nbsp; I know that my mother knew &#45; either personally or via phone &#45; almost all of the parents whose kids were my friends and there were certainly phone calls back and forth just to apprise one another if the traveling circus was either moving or up to something.&amp;nbsp; There were friends whose parents both worked, but they still kept tabs via phone and these kids were also welcome at my home at any time and a few spent considerable time there.&amp;nbsp; There are far more parents working today than before, and many of these kids also come from single&#45;parent families whose custodial parent is stretched thin to work and also oversee the activities.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this badly frayed parental net that makes teen freedom more problematic, I believe, since the parents aren&#39;t around to keep an eye on things and also aren&#39;t familiar with the parents of their kids&#39; peers.
Summer childcare in my area is easier for the younger kids.&amp;nbsp; There are multiple daycamp programs through non&#45;profit agencies as well as through the local municipal governments, who hire college students to keep an eye on elementary aged kids at the local parks and pavilions.&amp;nbsp; But when the children enter middle school, they no longer qualify for many of those programs and are left to their own devices &#45; precisely the worst possible time in life to have that happen to a child.&amp;nbsp; The result is that more than a few young teens &#45; impulsive, sexually curious, some not a little gender&#45;confused, and frankly feeling a bit abandoned &#45; spend their time unmonitored with their peers in a weird, whacked stew of testosterone, estogen and other various hormones.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a recipe that makes me, as a parent, more than a little nauseated and causes the same worry that weighed on my friend years ago.
So what options are there to help handle this?&amp;nbsp; They need to be able to spend time apart and learn to handle independence, much as many learn to drive a car with lessons, practice and guidance before they actually slide behind the wheel; as Kurtwood Smith remarked in a radio ad&amp;nbsp;for the Masonic Youth Organization, De Molay:&amp;nbsp; you can&#39;t just lock them in their room.

    Expect some conflict and pushback as the kids chafe at the perceived tethers, not knowing that you really do want to lock them in their room.&amp;nbsp; Apart from the aggravation, what they say will give you a sense of what&#39;s going through their head and where it&#39;s coming from.
    Be explicit about return times so that there&#39;s little chance of confusion that escalates into real unpleasantry.
    As I&#39;m finding out with two teens and an elementary schooler, consider actually writing the times on a calendar or handy notepad so that you can keep it straight yourself and not appear to be the senile, doddering fool.&amp;nbsp; Kids can blow through multiple plan permutations in a heartbeat and think that you&#39;ve&amp;nbsp;approved plan G when you&#39;re really still at their plan C because of conversation with another child who&#39;s calculating plan D on his own.
    Be clear on expectations about notice.&amp;nbsp; I understand&amp;nbsp;&#45; I remember &#45; the freedom to go with buddies to the store for a soda or a magazine and I want them to have some latitude as well.&amp;nbsp; But if you&#39;re going to someone&#39;s house and end up elsewhere, please contact me just to provide a heads&#45;up.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re there?&amp;nbsp; Fine, thanks for letting me know.&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s a glitch in the plan that might cause delay, then contact me so that we can sort things out.
    Try to have a sense of what adults are around and if necessary, take a moment to pick up the phone and call the parent(s) and introduce yourself.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re likely to be relieved to hear that their own kid is spending time with someone whose own parent appears to give a damn.&amp;nbsp;
    Pick the moments on when to speak about stuff that you&#39;re hearing.&amp;nbsp; Teens will do&amp;nbsp;goofy things and it&#39;s probably not much different from your own youth.&amp;nbsp; If the teens are scrawling the word kar on their t&#45;shirts and piggybacking one another through the Wendy&#39;s drive&#45;thru to order a Frosty, then hell, what are they hurting?&amp;nbsp;
    Occasionally check on where they are when they say that they&#39;re somewhere.&amp;nbsp; I won&#39;t just drive to a location and search for them, but I have altered my driving route if already out just to see if they&#39;re around.&amp;nbsp; Then I can mentally cross&#45;reference that with what I&#39;m hearing later when they&#39;re home.
    Don&#39;t be afraid to challenge them if something doesn&#39;t appear right or as it was supposed to be.&amp;nbsp; If you were with Steve tonight, why did he call here looking for you?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s certainly uncomfortable and potentially nasty, but the kids learn that you are paying attention and frankly, I believe that more than a few are relieved that you actually are paying attention.
    Try to remember to take a few moments to go over anybody else&#39;s plans and activities.&amp;nbsp; Teens are notoriously egocentric &#45; like politicians, except that most teens grow up &#45; and will sometimes forget that younger sibling has a championship baseball game or that Grandma&#39;s coming to visit.&amp;nbsp; That way, you can both hammer out a plan that satisfies them, younger brother and Grandma without creating needless angst.
    Grab any opportunity available to have the friends over so that you can meet them and make the place available, if at all possible, for sleepovers and get&#45;togethers.
    Share your concerns with them about kids and situations and if at all possible, try to be as specific as possible.&amp;nbsp; That kid is trouble!&amp;nbsp; will probably engender feelings of loyalty from your own kid while specific circumstances and events, if you can enumerate them, helps your child delineate why that kid really is trouble.

This is going to be an ongoing exercise that will certainly test our &#45; and our kids&#39; &#45; patience as we work through what&#39;s acceptable and find common ground.&amp;nbsp; There have already been tense moments and each side has had to apologize to the other for testiness, and I anticipate that there will be more until they are finally on their own two feet.
And honestly, the piggybacking at Wendy&#39;s sounds like fun.&amp;nbsp;

<title>&#8220;Part of Me Thinks That We Should Just Default&#8230;&#8221;</title>
<body>The title quote is from a college student that I&#39;ve known since his elementary school years and encapsulates what I think that many are now starting to think.&amp;nbsp; Ron Paul just opined about the possibility and it&#39;s making the rounds of the internet.&amp;nbsp; Just default and let&#39;s get this over with.&amp;nbsp; Now.&amp;nbsp; But what precisely is meant by default on August 2?
Let&#39;s consider this from a micro level, the level at which millions are operating when they have to decide whether to pay the mortgage, buy food, or continue to provide the electric and gas for the everyday life.&amp;nbsp; The United States Government is about to get a glimpse of life for the average Joe and Jane who are struggling to make ends meet since they had their jobs outsourced to China and India, and judging by the verbiage, they are terrified.
Good.&amp;nbsp; The members of the Congress and Executive Branch deserve to be scared.
First, there is still money flowing into the federal household but with the way that the bills and payments are hitting, there&#39;s going to be a cash shortfall.&amp;nbsp; The federal household has a large amount of less&#45;liquid assets &#45; Rolexes, fine china and a monster set of exercise equipment &#45; but there&#39;s no longer any federal money market account on which to rely and the emergency fund is exhausted.&amp;nbsp; They could sell the assets but anybody who recognized the need would take it for too great a discount and besides, it would both take too long as well as look bad.&amp;nbsp; And if we got rid of all of the land that Great Uncle Teddy left us, it would be a tragedy.&amp;nbsp; The creditors have continued to provide credit since the payments have been made to date but come August 2, the minimum payment due will fall on the same day that the cash flow is negative and all of the other bills are due.&amp;nbsp; Barry and John have bickered and argued, yelling epithets at one another as they bang on the granite countertops and tossed the occasional cup of Starbucks at one another.&amp;nbsp; So if there&#39;s still some money available but a raft of bills, what to do?
Make a priority list of what has to be paid and then work through the various permutations.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s see, now.&amp;nbsp; The parents exhausted their savings on educating us and we&#39;ve got to help them each month with a monthly stipend.&amp;nbsp; The kids have all of their various activities as well as the stuff that we have to provide for them, such as food, shelter and the medicine cabinet full of medications.&amp;nbsp; There are the multiple club memberships, dues and charities which we support and God knows that some good comes from that.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t forget the security that we pay for since the neighborhood has gotten a bit rougher and seedier; we need to have access to strong security.&amp;nbsp; So how do we cut?&amp;nbsp;
In the real world of repo&#39;d cars, terminated utilities and food stamps, people would at one time have considered missing some credit payments.&amp;nbsp; But the cash flow is so weak and the choices so stark, that more people are unwilling to let the credit go.&amp;nbsp; The business community has noted for the first time that folks will willingly let go of the mortgage while continuing to pay the monthly credit card bill and it&#39;s recently reported by a Data collection agency that more of the monthly revolving credit &#45; nearing 10% &#45; to pay for necessities instead of discretionary items.&amp;nbsp; But like Frank Herbert&#39;s Planet Arakis, the spice must flow and people now believe that credit must flow as well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What does happen if we miss the revolving credit payment?
We&#39;ll certainly get a nasty letter and probably a phone call from the bank since we missed.&amp;nbsp; The tone and content of the discussion will be ugly and it&#39;s going to be embarrassing in the extreme.&amp;nbsp; The bank in turn depends on us for it&#39;s own asset quality and dividends to large number of investors, but we&#39;ve never missed a payment until now and besides, what else is out there in the world of credit quality?&amp;nbsp; No, we&#39;re safe in our own house and the security devices and service will keep us from being evicted.&amp;nbsp; But what will happen is that our interest rates will go up appreciably since the bank is going to ratchet up the pressure on us; after all, it&#39;s not like there are a lot of solid creditors around nowadays, either.&amp;nbsp; The value of our intangible assets will also take a massive hit so that our good name and reputation are sullied in the eyes of everyone else that could provide credit for us and with no new income streams &#45; it&#39;s not like royalties manufacture new income streams &#45; our cost of borrowing there will also go up and do so significantly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The impact upon our neighbors will also&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;considerable since everybody has depended upon our spending to keep themselves in relatively decent shape &#45; the domestic help, the coffee shop and&amp;nbsp;don&#39;t forget the personal chef.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Net basis, we can get through but we&#39;re going to finally have to make some decisions about how we allocate money to the creditors, our parents and the kids.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, if we stiff the creditors again, they&#39;ll truly cut off the funds and we&#39;ll be screwed.&amp;nbsp; As ugly as it is, what else is there to force us to make the decisions that must be made?
That&#39;s an idea of what goes on at the personal level and there&#39;s acknowledgement that the Federal Reserve is working with the Treasury Department to likewise determine what the priorities are and whose check is honored&amp;nbsp;when the default arrives.&amp;nbsp; But what interests me most is the order of priority and which payments are honored.&amp;nbsp; Do our servicemen receive their pay and will the elderly continue to receive their benefits?&amp;nbsp; Will our 45 million recipients of SNAP benefits be able to continue purchasing food?&amp;nbsp; Or will the foreign creditors be paid at the expense of the citizenry?&amp;nbsp; Talk is ultimately cheap and it&#39;s these actions that will indicate what the politicians truly believe and hold most dear.&amp;nbsp; What do we owe each of our constituent groups &#45; foreign and domestic?&amp;nbsp; What else&amp;nbsp;will finally force us to make the choices?
When Middle child and I spoke of this earlier this evening, I remarked that no matter what happened, the sun would rise and set and we&#39;d manage to continue having food upon the table.&amp;nbsp; What I didn&#39;t say was that if we didn&#39;t default and finally deal with the issues, we&#39;d probably have food on the table but it was increasingly unlikely that he&#39;d be able to put food on the table for his own unborn children.</body>

<title>Do Parents Belong at Rock Concerts?</title>
<body>One of the touted punk rock events is the annual Vans Warped Tour, which travels from city to city with a line up of dozens of bands.&amp;nbsp; While&amp;nbsp; I enjoyed the occasional show in my youth, it&#39;s different when you bring the kids.&amp;nbsp; The music is stunningly loud and the crush in the pit up front tight enough that I&#39;m content to sit in the back and actually enjoy some of the music while I read.&amp;nbsp; Or write, for that matter.&amp;nbsp; But does a middle aged man even have a place amongst this hip venue?&amp;nbsp; Exactly what the hell am I even doing here?
First, let me provide a background.&amp;nbsp; This particular event &#45; tickets purchased almost a half year in advance &#45; is a peace offering to Middle.&amp;nbsp; While I was gone for a weekend with Eldest and her peers, Middle entered an online radio station contest using my name, since I&#39;m technically an adult.&amp;nbsp; He informed my wife, who approved, but neither actually informed me.&amp;nbsp; (Un)fortunately, he won the prizes and the station manager rapidly understood that it was a&amp;nbsp; minor&#39;s entry when he called me days later to congratulate me on a win about which I was utterly baffled.&amp;nbsp; Whe he asked about the age of the actual entrant, I told him the truth.&amp;nbsp;
Two lessons for future use, son:&amp;nbsp; first, tell me if you ever use my name and ask permission first;&amp;nbsp; second, don&#39;t expect me to lie for you.
I still felt terrible since he missed an opportunity to meet the members of &#39;Avenged Sevenfold&#39; and receive an electric guitar signed by the band.&amp;nbsp; Even my wife was appalled at my inability to cope with the phone call and seize the prize.&amp;nbsp; Hence, the concert.
But shouldn&#39;t teens go to concerts themselves?&amp;nbsp; Isn&#39;t that part of the experience?&amp;nbsp; Frankly, no.

    The event occurred across state lines in a city in which Eldest, who drove, has never been.&amp;nbsp; Middle doesn&#39;t have the navigational skills yet and I saw no value in sending two teen minors through major metropolitan rush hour traffic enroute to a concert.&amp;nbsp; Eldest still drove, but I handled the navigational and color commentary duties and given the afternoon parking lot on the expressway, I&#39;m glad that I went.
    This is a full&#45;blown rock concert and there are all manner of teens &#45; and adults &#45; there and not all of them give a rat&#39;s ass about someone else.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve tried to raise the kids with both the expectation of considering consequences as well as acting in a moral and civilized manner.&amp;nbsp; The unfortunate reality is that a substantial number of kids and young adults haven&#39;t been taught the same thing and I&#39;ve witnessed circumstances in which behavior regresses to a Lord of the Flies level.&amp;nbsp; If this is their first experience, then I want to at least be in the background to keep tabs on things.&amp;nbsp;
    I&#39;m continally curious about the teen/young adult scene and what&#39;s occurring there.&amp;nbsp; The more information and experience that I have, the better that I&#39;m able to assess what&#39;s going on.
    Stupidity is contagious and teens whose hormones and judgment are affected by ear&#45;bleeding rock music are especially susceptible to catching it.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re not certain, you can ask a kid who comes in one evening with green hair.&amp;nbsp; Hey, they said that they&#39;d done it before.&amp;nbsp; What could go wrong?
    Taking them isn&#39;t the same as being with them the entire time.&amp;nbsp; They brought along a friend and I simply arranged to meet them at periodic intervals, letting them experience the music and event.&amp;nbsp;

Right.&amp;nbsp; &#39;Nuff said.
Finally, some of the music is actually good and I&#39;ve now got several tunes that I&#39;ll be buying for the mp3 player.&amp;nbsp; It wouldn&#39;t happen if I were still listening to the &amp;quot;Greatest Hits of My Life&amp;quot; format, so I&#39;ll find my spot with the other parents in the back and sit back swilling the $3 bottled water.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Middle Class:&nbsp; It&#8217;s NOT the Economy&#8230;</title>
<body>There&#39;s been&amp;nbsp;much&amp;nbsp;written&amp;nbsp;on the decline of the American Middle Class, facing it&#39;s worst time perhaps since the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; The statistics point out falling income, insufficient assets to support the classic American notion of &#39;retirement&#39; and a significant number of people who owe more on their house &#45; their largest asset &#45; than it could ever possibly again be worth.&amp;nbsp; But while everyone is focusing on the economic aspects, as though the&amp;nbsp;number of bedrooms&amp;nbsp;is paramount, what&#39;s being overlooked is that the true danger to the American middle class lies in the political realm.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a misdirection that has to be corrected since we&#39;ve long ago crossed from the purely economic into the political realm and I&#39;m not certain that many realize that fact.&amp;nbsp; The protests in Greece and Spain demonstrate that there comes a point at which the consequences of &#39;economic&#39; decisions are addressed in a purely political manner as the governments in power attempt to fend off the masses to continue in power.
One of the criticisms of the economics profession is that&amp;nbsp;economists have tried to wrap a soft, inexact science in a hard science shell.&amp;nbsp; Economics is at its heart the determination of how resources are allocated and used to the best effect; this is itself a political question as perceptions and emotions come into play as much as pure numbers.&amp;nbsp; This packaging however, has carried over into today&#39;s society in general as the news programs spend their time throwing numbers around, mesmerizing the&amp;nbsp;audience with the sheer volume of information.&amp;nbsp; Certainly, if we can track this data and put it into neat numeric formats, then there must be a rational and easily obtainable answer, as though juggling the various economic variables were the same as adjusting&amp;nbsp;recipe ingredients for Chef Ramsey.
&amp;nbsp;Today&#39;s American economy is notable by the disproportionate size of the financial sector and huge federal deficits, incurred to help the Too&#45;Big&#45;To&#45;Fail financial institutions from their self&#45;inflicted injuries.&amp;nbsp; These injuries didn&#39;t arise from economic circumstances, but actually from political actions that backfired.

    Excessive and unmonitored risks were taken by these commercial and investment banks because no one was paying attention to them.&amp;nbsp; No one paid attention to them because of a political action, the repeal of the Glass&#45;Steagall Act, which had successfully regulated the financial services industry after the last debacle of the Great Depression.
    The repeal of Glass&#45;Steagall was made possible by massive campaign contributions to Congress from the financial services industry, a political activity which hasn&#39;t been satisfactorily regulated since God alone knows when.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s infuriating is that at this juncture, corporate campaign contributions can&#39;t be successfully limited because the Supreme Court has ruled that it infringes upon their right to free speech.&amp;nbsp;
    Much of the job loss that&#39;s plagued us is attributable to a blind, single&#45;minded devotion to free trade regardless of the trade policies of the other nations, whose own policies might permit dumping, currency&#45;pegging and inhumane working conditions.&amp;nbsp; This is mandated in political treaties which coincide with the economic theories that spawn them.
    The economic response to&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;2008 collapse of Lehman and the near&amp;nbsp;collapse of the economic&amp;nbsp;system was the passage of TARP, a purely political act.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This unpopular act occurred despite widespread civic opposition and with the additional input from the Treasury Secretary &#45; a financial/economic personage &#45; that failure to pass the legislation would probably result in widespread civil unrest and the imposition of martial law, a completely political act.
    There has been significant evidence provided that the federal government and the Federal Reserve are involved to some extent in&amp;nbsp;the actions of the equity markets, a purely political act to maintain a semblance of normalcy for the general public.

&amp;nbsp;The effect of these, and other, political acts is to move the government from regulator for the common good to that of co&#45;conspirator with a corrupted and self&#45;serving minority and this is probably the greatest threat to the American Middle Class instead of falling wages and job losses.&amp;nbsp; The strength of the American Experience has arisen from a shared sense of common values, as laughable as that might seem to certain cynics.&amp;nbsp; These values include hard work, collective honesty and most importantly, a respect and belief in the rule of law.&amp;nbsp; For all of its flaws, there had been a common belief that the Constitution and Bill of Rights were the mainstay of the nation and that the laws were generally just and would ultimately win out to the benefit of the whole.&amp;nbsp;

    When corporations are found to have broken the law and the penalty is a mere fraction of the illegal proceeds with no other correction to the offenders, the common values are destroyed.
    When banks are found to undermine ancient common law principles by wholesale forging of foreclosure documents, attesting to the veracity of information that they know to be wrong, the common values are destroyed.
    When banks are found to further undermine the law by subverting the role of the notary public &#45; having employees sign the signature of someone who&#39;s dead &#45; and with no meaningful legal response, the common values are destroyed.&amp;nbsp;
    When companies and firms betray their fiduciary interest, face&#45;ripping clients and misdirecting innocents into needlessly risky investments, the common values are destroyed.
    When the government is seen to act as enabler to these same companies and individuals, refusing to let them pay the penalty for their actions, the common values are destroyed.
    When the President and Speaker of the House are seen to be playing golf while the government is mired in budgetary and debt morass, the common values are destroyed.
    When two parents work multiple jobs to provide basics for their children while millions are paid out to corporate executives as the payoff for failed plans and lost jobs, the common values are destroyed.
    When a father has to explain to his child why his refusal to do something just because&amp;nbsp;everyone else is doing it&amp;nbsp;isn&#39;t dumb, the common values are destroyed.

I&#39;ve resigned myself to the fact that this country is going to face economic turmoil, unseen since the days of the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve worked to teach the kids real world lessons about money, credit and values to prepare them for their future in a world with much greater competition and fewer resources.&amp;nbsp; But I will not resign myself to the notion that my children &#45; and all of their friends, classmates and peers&amp;nbsp;&#45; are condemned to live as second class citizens serving as debt serfs to the benefit of a privileged few.
That does not come as the result of economic actions, but political ones.&amp;nbsp; The work now will be to relearn what was once&amp;nbsp;known amongst our forebears, but since forgotten.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Practicing Austerity at Home</title>
<body>With the news of political unrest and potential default in Greece swirling around our own trip to Greece, it was impossible to not have conversation some of the austerity measures being considered by their government.&amp;nbsp; According to an article in the International Herald Tribune, some of the measures being proposed include:

    &amp;quot;Solidarity&amp;quot; tax of 1 &#45; 5%&amp;nbsp;on all households to help defray the debt payments;
    Increased excise taxes on such items as gasoline, tobacco and alcohol;
    Special levies on on high&#45;value properties and high&#45;income individuals;
    Increased mandatory retirement age;
    Decreased educational and healthcare spending;
    Cutting of temporary contracts by government;
    Sales of public infrastructure to the highest bidder, which you should read as foreign highest bidder.

Given our tendency to chat with the locals, we got an earful of what it actually entails to average Greeks and we made it a point of sharing that with the kids.&amp;nbsp; They have to have a sense of what&#39;s coming down the pike since their generation will have to contend with the lion&#39;s share of the clean&#45;up work.
It&#39;s also important to discuss austerity because we&#39;re now having to practice some of our own to pay off the bills from the trip itself.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d saved for more than two years to pay for the trip and the airfare and most lodging was already paid off, but that didn&#39;t count a fair amount of food and incidental spending and when I viewed the amount charged online, I winced.&amp;nbsp; While I intellectually understood the exchange rate of $1.42 to the Euro, it was a different prospect to see how that translated to actual dollars on the statement.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, I wasn&#39;t prepared for the foreign transaction fee charged by the card company for each transaction that occurred overseas and the cumulative result was sobering.
We&#39;ve now decided to practice austerity at home while the outstanding bills are brought back to earth and this has been made clear to the kids.&amp;nbsp; For instance:

    Youngest is now playing a midsummer baseball tournament and instead of spending money on bottled water at the concession stand, we&#39;re making sure that we take a half dozen bottles in a cooler;
    Any requests for money by the kids are now met by the comment about Europe and the question of whether I&#39;ve been repaid on the time that&#39;s owed me for the backyard project&amp;nbsp;and that&#39;s managed to squelch several requests;
    Greater attention is being paid to the home cooking and restaurant meals are now out of the picture.

The bills aren&#39;t overwhelming, while shocking, and nobody&#39;s going to lose their home over it.&amp;nbsp; But while my mother always repeated gotta pay the mortgage first during my childhood, now I can simply say Europe and the same message will be understood.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; July&#8217;s Food Prices Up, But Moderating</title>
<body>After a torrid June increase in the cost of the grocery retail marketbasket, July&#39;s survey continued to show an increase but the pace was less than the previous month.&amp;nbsp; The average cost of the 47 item marketbasket rose to $185.00 from June&#39;s $184.07; the PracticalDad Index has risen to 103.71 and the three month moving average is now at 102.99.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the cost of the basket is 3.7% higher than the survey&#39;s inception in November, 2010.
Unlike previous months, canola oil and coffee were unchanged and far fewer items underwent price increases than in June.&amp;nbsp; The principal increases were for&amp;nbsp;hot dogs (5.1%), flour (5.2%) and potatoes (8.3%).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Potatoes?
Go figure, because I haven&#39;t got a clue as to why, either.&amp;nbsp;
For the record, July&#39;s survey was done one week later in the month than the other months due to travel.&amp;nbsp; The monthly index results, and the moving average are as follows:

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Syntagma Square - Weighing the Risks, Taking the Kids</title>
<body>When you&#39;ve planned and saved for more than two years for a &amp;quot;once&#45;in&#45;a&#45;lifetime&amp;quot; family vacation, you want everything to go off and it was no different for the recent vacation to Italy and Greece, aka The PIGS Tour.&amp;nbsp; But the latter part of the trip involved several days in Athens and it was while we were in Rome that global news caught and showed footage of the rioting in Athens&#39; Syntagma Square, outside of the Greek parliament and we were left wondering &#45; well, me actually &#45; at what point we pull the plug on the latter portion.&amp;nbsp; With two teens and a child, precisely when does it become unsafe to travel there?&amp;nbsp; Even if it&#39;s physically safe, is it justifiable to take the kids to see a politically polarized site during what&#39;s supposed to be a &amp;quot;get away from it all&amp;quot; experience?
If you&#39;ve been out of town for awhile, the nightly protests in Syntagma Square are the public&#39;s response to multiple factors, mostly the Parliament&#39;s move to adopt painful austerity measures in order to obtain the next portion of the European bailout money to the tune of about 15 Billion Euros.&amp;nbsp; In this case, the Parliament voted to adopt the measures while we were in Italy and it was during this time that things spiraled out of control for an evening.&amp;nbsp; Although we left our computers and most of the cellphones at home, I still took a few moments on hotel computers to check the State Department website and find out if there was any travel warning, which there wasn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Our tour guide, a multi&#45;lingual German woman, called a colleague in Greece and passed along that any issues were localized solely to the Syntagma Square vicinity; the remainder of Athens and the rest of Greece weren&#39;t experiencing unrest.&amp;nbsp; The final point was a review of our travel insurance policy.&amp;nbsp; We discovered that the policy doesn&#39;t cover changes due to civil unrest and we would&amp;nbsp;not be&amp;nbsp;reimbursed for the&amp;nbsp;prepaid costs of hotel/flight should we&amp;nbsp;choose to dump&amp;nbsp;any part of the Greek&amp;nbsp;segment.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately for us however, it did reimburse us for the cost of emergency evacuation.&amp;nbsp; Great.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll get back the 15000 Euros that I had to put on the credit card for the taxi to the airport evacuation site...Given all the factors, we were in for the trip and fortunately for us, things had calmed down by the time we were to leave for Athens.
The ride from the airport to our hotel took more than a half hour and we talked with our driver, an engaging middle&#45;aged Greek gentleman, who explained some of the average Greek&#39;s perspective of the economic difficulties.&amp;nbsp; The politicians from both parties have had 40 years to screw things up and they&#39;ve succeeded.&amp;nbsp; The demonstrations are the work of the communists, damn them.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re screwed...When my wife inquired about finding a decent taverna where the locals eat, he directed us to a city section called Plaka, one of the earliest residential sections of modern Athens and located immediately at the base of the Acropolis plateau;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;he stated that we could find any number of decent restaurants there without all of the tourist schtick.&amp;nbsp; After we checked in and unloaded our bags, we studied the map and found that Plaka was perhaps 1.5 km due west and immediately on the other side of...Syntagma Square.&amp;nbsp; Since it was still in the mid&#45;afternoon, and the cabdrivers were on strike that day, we thought to hell with it and hoofed it westwards.
The square itself was anticlimactic at that hour of the day.&amp;nbsp; We walked west along Leoforos Vasilissis Sofia, a main thoroughfare notable by some museums, an embassy and attractive apartment buildings and we only became aware that the square was coming up by the increasing presence of one or two policemen, with another carrying a submachine gun another block ahead.&amp;nbsp; In the distance, a block away from the square was a dark blue school bus that&amp;nbsp;had carried in the riot squads, who were clustered along the fence of the National Gardens as they kibbitzed and smoked.&amp;nbsp; At the corner with Leoforos Vasillis Amalias,&amp;nbsp;on the left, &amp;nbsp;was the Parliament building with the Memorial to the Unknown Greek Soldier on the side&amp;nbsp;facing Amalias.&amp;nbsp; Across&amp;nbsp;Amalias from the tomb&amp;nbsp;was Syntagma Square, notable by the number of banners and posters hanging up.&amp;nbsp; The great majority of these signs were in Cyrillic and a handful of early protestors milled around as though they were awaiting the opening gate for a concert, chatting and smoking as well.&amp;nbsp; When a handful sitting nearby did start a chant, a cellphone would ring and one of the chanters would answer it and sit down to chat with the chant dying away.&amp;nbsp; We continued through the square and as I started to doubt the big deal, we passed another building whose front window had been shattered, apparently by a brick.&amp;nbsp; Other buildings suffered minor damage such as graffiti and cracked windows, but these became fewer and farther between as we moved away from the square.&amp;nbsp; Our after&#45;dinner return was much closer to when things began and it was at this point that we saw the street between the square and the Parliament cordoned off to traffic as the number of protestors had swelled.&amp;nbsp; Ahead of us was a shoulder&#45;to&#45;shoulder line of several dozen protestors, each of whom was wearing a plain mask, albeit not the Guy Fawkes mask&amp;nbsp;from the movie V For Vendetta.&amp;nbsp; As it turned out, they were lined up for a photo op and when the photographer was finished, they removed their masks and dispersed in knots and it was then that I realized that some of the protestors were actually children, some younger than my youngest child.&amp;nbsp;
When we asked a protestor what was being yelled, the laconic response was they&#39;re yelling against the government and he then simply walked away.&amp;nbsp; Two young policemen on the corner, dressed in simple outfits and leaning on plexiglass riot shields, were more talkative and explained some of what we were seeing.&amp;nbsp; The protestors began to arrive in greater numbers at about 6 PM and they would finally disperse around 5 AM and excepting the televised coverage, the crowds had been peaceful for the remainder of the nights.&amp;nbsp; As we spoke, they went on to say that while the riot troops were available in case of problems, they were generally out of eyesight so as to not provoke additional difficulties and their own job was to assure that some order was maintained.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, the cops were friendlier and more talkative than the protestors as we had further&amp;nbsp;conversations with the riot police further up the block; one of them even joked with Youngest, who was a bit uncomfortable in the presence of real automatic weapons.&amp;nbsp; It was a very different proposition to see a fully operational submachine than the Nerf and virtual weapons wielded while playing online and with friends.&amp;nbsp; The remainder of the hike back was uneventful, apart from seeing a sandbag&amp;nbsp;gun emplacement hidden behind the trees of the National Gardens,&amp;nbsp;and when the next morning rolled around, there was no second thought about safety and we again returned to that vicinity.&amp;nbsp;
For all of the talk and news coverage, it really was a non&#45;event and honestly something that I&#39;m glad that the kids got to see.&amp;nbsp; There was serious discussion about what&#39;s causing the unrest and I&#39;m gratified that when we spoke with Greeks, all three listened.&amp;nbsp; One of my personal goals for the trip was to help the kids understand that there&#39;s far more out there than what they see in smalltown America.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, they need to see that there is such a thing as non&#45;violent protest as average people vent their anger at those in power when the standard channels become uselessly dysfunctional.&amp;nbsp; Because when push comes to shove, my fear is akin to the old saying:&amp;nbsp; As we once were, you are now.&amp;nbsp; As we are now, you will become.&amp;nbsp;

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Lessons Learned from Traveling Overseas</title>
<body>After more than two weeks of traveling throughout Italy and Greece &#45; a long&#45;planned and saved&#45;for trip &#45; we&#39;re back and I&#39;ve tallied some of the practical lessons that I learned from traveling overseas with kids.

    Learn about the tipping culture in other countries.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re used to American wait staff working for pittance wages and making up the difference in tips and we consequently tip well so that the folks can hopefully make a decent wage.&amp;nbsp; What we didn&#39;t learn until the third day in Italy was that European wait staff draws a regular wage and a tip is appreciated for very good service, but not expected, and about 10% is par for very good service.&amp;nbsp; With the cost of a meal in a decent European restaurant, three Italian waiters made their nut in one fell swoop and they are now lighting votive candles to the patron saint of wait staff in our honor.
    Even if the kids are a bit older, and our youngest will be entering fourth grade, pay particular attention to where they are since the crowds can be simply overwhelming.&amp;nbsp; Take proactive measures, such as dressing the kids in identical brightly colored shirts or hats, wearing your own piece of distinctive clothing to stand out in a crowd, assuring that the kids know in what hotel they&#39;re staying so that they can tell police, and having a rally point in the event they realize that they&#39;re separated.&amp;nbsp; In our case, Youngest was separated three times &#45; and honestly, none were due to his wandering &#45; but in each instance, he used his head and stayed put instead of panicking and wandering.&amp;nbsp; Thank God that he&#39;s the one with the strong streak of common sense.&amp;nbsp; Even when the kids are older, you have to maintain some vigilance since teens are insular and many aren&#39;t used to paying attention to what&#39;s occurring around them.
    If the kids are old enough &#45; and you can afford it &#45; they&#39;ll want their own room to share and that&#39;s honestly a good thing since they will make you nuts.&amp;nbsp; However, they need to know that the &amp;quot;small sink in the bathroom&amp;quot; is actually called a bidet and isn&#39;t used for washing feet.&amp;nbsp; Editorial note:&amp;nbsp; they weren&#39;t my kids, thank God.
    Even if&amp;nbsp;you&#39;re nervous, take the time to&amp;nbsp;try the local life and that includes riding the local transportation.&amp;nbsp; Knowing how to figure out the local subway system is a good exercise in reading and deciphering maps, as is finding the local laundromat.&amp;nbsp; Spend time with the map and then do your best, sharing the mistakes with the kids as they occur.&amp;nbsp; It takes more time than just doing it yourself, but the kids need to learn and that&#39;s simply a part of being a father.
    If at all possible, have some ground rules on souvenir spending.&amp;nbsp; In our case, each kid decided what he or she wanted to spend and if any additional spending was needed after their funds were exhausted, then they could either pass on it or borrow the money and pay it off on the backyard project&amp;nbsp;at $5/hour.&amp;nbsp; Two of the three kids now owe me hours and one steadfastly refused to spend anything as he&#39;s saving for an electric guitar.&amp;nbsp; The second part of our souvenir spending is that the kid can buy anything with their own money, but if he has to borrow, then it has to be on something that is endemic to the place; I can always buy a fedora in the US but not something that&#39;s italian or greek made.
    Be ready for an extended period at breakfast. Young children and preteens&amp;nbsp;will generally awaken earlier than teenagers&amp;nbsp;and if there&#39;s no press, then let the kids make their way down on their own.&amp;nbsp; That said, I will graze through breakfast like a hobbit, sitting down first with the younger one and then sitting down again for second breakfast at tensies with the teens.&amp;nbsp; While my own intake is less, it still makes for a pudgy hobbit&#45;like father.

The last lesson for now is that it can take days for a youngster&#39;s body clock to get back into synch.&amp;nbsp; I started the notes for this article at 4 AM this morning when I awoke and was then joined by Youngest at 615 AM.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s now going on 1030 at night and my own case of jet lag is kicking in viciously.&amp;nbsp; The day has been one of cleaning and unpacking, writing and riding herd on the occasionally cranky youngsters and it&#39;s now time for the hobbit father to turn in for tomorrow&#39;s tensies with the Eldest.</body>

<title>I&#8217;ll Be Back&#8230;</title>
<body>People with websites are often driven to keep producing new material, and I&#39;m no different.&amp;nbsp; But if I&#39;m going to write about fatherhood and the family &#45; and what impacts each &#45; then my first priority has to be those things, and I&#39;ve settled for a new article about once each three days, on average.&amp;nbsp; Personal matters now dictate that I go quiet for about three weeks, but be assured that I&#39;ll be back with new articles and some other changes to the site in the offing.
Thanks for reading the site and putting me on your RSS feed and as the California Governor once said, I&#39;ll be back.

<title>&#8220;Go the F%$# to Sleep&#8221;</title>
<body>The kids have Goodnight Moon and a plethora of other bedtime stories, but after catching the viral marketing campaign, I made sure to purchase my own bedtime story, Go the F%$# to Sleep.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a&amp;nbsp;wonderfully rude bedtime story that perfectly encapsulates the anger of a tired, pressed father whose little one refuses to sleep.&amp;nbsp; The story is best described as&amp;nbsp;That 70s Show&#39;s Red Forman, one of my favorite television fathers, channeling Captain Kangaroo.
There&#39;s a common perception of children and bedtimes, where the children snuggle up for a story and then gently go to sleep.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the stuff of old movies and Hallmark cards but like life, it isn&#39;t always that way.&amp;nbsp; Small children either might not want &#45; or be able &#45; to go to sleep and when Dad&#39;s at the end of a long day of his own, the tension can become unbelievable.&amp;nbsp; Dad&#39;s spent time with Junior and now wants to have a little time to himself, or with Mom, and the kid simply won&#39;t call it quits.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes it&#39;s due to physical factors, such as too much caffeine or activity at a time when things should be winding down; and sometimes it&#39;s because the kid is simply being an ass.&amp;nbsp; How far can I push Dad?&amp;nbsp; If I wear him down, then I&#39;ll get to do what I want to do.&amp;nbsp; If he starts letting me tonight, then I can mention it again tomorrow night.&amp;nbsp; At other times, it&#39;s because the kid simply hasn&#39;t seen much of Dad and will do whatever possible to keep him around.
Full disclosure:&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve said these same things in a sotto voce tone, hoping to God that I&#39;m not heard and feeling horrendously guilty for not living up to the Hollywood standard.&amp;nbsp; Children are wonderful and loving.&amp;nbsp; They can also be exceptionally difficult and after hours of work or hours of caring for them, you simply want a break, even if it comes via your own sleep.
While the tenor of the verses clearly ratchets up from one page to the next however, what&#39;s thoroughly absent is the sense that Dad&#39;s going to go psycho.&amp;nbsp; Even at the end, Dad is still tiptoeing around and finally takes the child in hand again to begin the process again.&amp;nbsp;
The verses are great and the artwork does full justice to the story and the book is thoroughly worth every penny.&amp;nbsp; So the next time you&#39;re thinking about buying a book, put aside the Stephen King and get this one instead.&amp;nbsp;
Then be sure that it doesn&#39;t wind up in Junior&#39;s bookcase.

<title>How To Handle Senior Year?</title>
<body>The kids are aging and growing and as my father, God bless him, used to say, ...and that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be.&amp;nbsp; My problem is that saying that presumes that I have a clue of how it&#39;s supposed to be.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m very comfortable with many aspects of fatherhood and parenting, but helping prepare a rising high school senior for the world is new and &#45; honestly &#45; scary territory.&amp;nbsp; Where&#39;s the balance betweem staying grounded with the family and becoming independent?&amp;nbsp; Because learning independence requires having a degree of independence.
I&#39;ve been to college and seen what happens with kids who are truly on their own for the first time and drive their proverbial freedom into a brick wall.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no perceptible reason why they couldn&#39;t handle it while I did, apart from the fact that my parents gave me some latitude as I came through high school.&amp;nbsp; Latitude?&amp;nbsp; In the early Spring of my senior high school year, they took a 10 day trip to Europe and left me to myself and the quiet surveillance of a community of small town neighbors and friends.&amp;nbsp; When I missed school with a virus, the vice&#45;principal&#39;s wife dropped by the first afternoon with some food and did indeed verify that I was truly sick.&amp;nbsp; Nothing terrible that some sleep and a quiet diet wouldn&#39;t cure and I later found that my father had been made aware while in France.&amp;nbsp; That however, was a very different time and environment.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;re going to Europe ourselves in two weeks, but the kids will come with us.&amp;nbsp; Not because we don&#39;t trust them, but because we believe that with the way things are going, these children might never again have the opportunity to see places that they&#39;ve wanted to go.&amp;nbsp; And trust me, I have no burning desire to travel to these places, but the kids do and so we&#39;ve saved for two years to make this work.&amp;nbsp;
But back to providing latitude.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve said for years that children are egocentric and if I could graph it with degree of egocentrism on the y&#45;axis and age on the x&#45;axis, it would be appear to be an oscillating wave with the low points in the middle years of childhood and the height both in the early years as well as the mid to late teens.&amp;nbsp; In the early years, the egocentrism is a function of need since they depend on you for almost everything and that lessens as they age.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve seen it ratchet upwards in the mid/late teens as they gain a taste of independence and a wider, more eclectic set of friends.&amp;nbsp; There are more things to do, a greater diversity in interests and activities, and kids are beginning to develop their own eccentricities and quirks on the&amp;nbsp;adulthood path.&amp;nbsp; I recall those days well as friends became black belts, developed their musical skills to impressive levels and experienced new genres of music.&amp;nbsp; Of course, friends also drank, smoked dope, broke into churches and subsequently drove around the county wearing clerical vestments, made master keys of the local high school and passed almost an entire school year using free gas courtesy of the pump for the district school buses.
Really.&amp;nbsp; And in this era of MTV&#39;s Jackass, it&#39;s only gotten weirder.
It&#39;s exciting and something in which an eager soon&#45;to&#45;be&#45;adult can completely lose herself.&amp;nbsp; Having seen much of this as well, it&#39;s frankly terrifying at moments.&amp;nbsp; So what are we trying to remember as Eldest enters this pubescent free&#45;fire zone?

    Always find out who&#39;s going to be there as much as possible.&amp;nbsp; Who is she with and if they&#39;re at someone&#39;s home, are the parents there?&amp;nbsp;
    As much as possible, where are they going to be?&amp;nbsp; Honestly, I have crawled into the car to take a short detour of six miles to get ice cream at the convenience store two blocks away and fortunately, it appears that what&#39;s supposed to happen is happening.
    What are the check&#45;in times?&amp;nbsp; Give us a call about mid&#45;evening to check in and let us know if there are any changes in plans.&amp;nbsp; If there is no call, then the kids should expect a call from us.
    Whenever possible, meet the other kids with whom they&#39;re spending times.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not perfect &#45; way, way far from it &#45; but it&#39;s a relief to at least put names with faces and there are instances when the vibes can jump out at you.
    Take a moment before they leave to remind them of a few items and then hope and pray that they remember the lessons that you&#39;ve left since they were old enough to listen.&amp;nbsp; Or at least before they started to ignore you because you were no longer cool.
    Go ahead and tell them that there are going to be nights that are at home and not out with the crowd.

<title>Black Ops vs Saving Private Ryan</title>
<body>I&#39;m an electronics nazi.&amp;nbsp; One of my great struggles is having to constantly monitor the various media to assure that the family guidelines are upheld, particularly when it pertains to the movie/television/games ratings and for the most part, the kids recognize that if Youngest is around, then a resolution must be found for the TV&#45;14 program that&#39;s presently airing.&amp;nbsp; We try to find a compromise and there are instances in which the television or computer game is halted and other times, Youngest or Middle leaves the room to find something else to do.&amp;nbsp; Tonight is one of those instances however, when I&#39;ve bent the rules and as Saving Private Ryan came on the television and Youngest got up to leave, I told him that he could stay and watch for awhile.&amp;nbsp; To her credit, my wife figured that there was method to my madness and said nothing, staying with Youngest as well.&amp;nbsp; Youngest made it through the opening and the combat on Omaha Beach before he dissolved into tears, at which point we found something else on the tube.
It&#39;s a painful lesson, for him as well as for me.&amp;nbsp; As I later explained to my wife, while we work hard to control the media exposure, many other parents do not.&amp;nbsp; Many of Youngest&#39;s third grade peers are actively watching R rated movies, TV14 programming and playing the war games such as Medal of Honor and Call of Duty:&amp;nbsp; Black Ops.&amp;nbsp; In these experiences, violence is gratuitous and without consequence.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re hit, you&#39;re able to reenter the game.&amp;nbsp; Combat is often marked&amp;nbsp;by a sense of heroism and glory and in movies at least, there&#39;s considerable banter and frequent instances of panache.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m not a veteran, it doesn&#39;t square with the reality of combat as described to me in my adulthood by my own father, a Korean War infantryman.&amp;nbsp; A reality that encompasses terror, grief and brutality as much as brotherly camaderie.&amp;nbsp; Elementary age children are being exposed to a one&#45;dimensional view of violence and brutality and while I won&#39;t permit such games or inappropriately rated programming here, when the kids visit their friends, they&#39;ll see it there.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m well aware that my nine year&#45;old son is acquainted with the Nazi Zombies found in Call of Duty:&amp;nbsp; Black Ops, even though I don&#39;t like it.
The opening sequences of Saving Private Ryan are profound in their immediacy and terror.&amp;nbsp; Death comes quickly, slowly, messily, quietly, randomly to someone.&amp;nbsp; A soldier survives an explosion to arise and be struck down immediately by a slug.&amp;nbsp; A soldier exposes himself to pull a buddy out of the way and within two minutes, is yelling to let &#39;em burn!&amp;nbsp; I want these scenes to stand against the sanitized, sterile violence found elsewhere in the movies and video games and I want him to understand that there are ramifications to war.&amp;nbsp;
Youngest talks occasionally of becoming a soldier, much as I talked of it when I was younger.&amp;nbsp; He plays with toy soldiers, as I did, and engages in mock combat with his friends.&amp;nbsp; That hasn&#39;t changed over the years and&amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t expect that it ever will.&amp;nbsp; But as the level of visual violence escalates amongst our children, I do want him to have a sense that there&#39;s something more involved than the stylized and sterile violence that his friends and peers are viewing frequently and routinely.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Independence and Communication</title>
<body>Parent and teen communication can get testy and it&#39;s no different here.&amp;nbsp; In our case, it often pertains to questions regarding independence since what one side thinks isn&#39;t what the other side thinks.&amp;nbsp; There has to be a balance between the two &#45; the teen being allowed to make independent decisions and the parent having some sense that things aren&#39;t entirely out of control.
My wife and I try to provide latitude since the only way that kids learn to handle independence is to actually have some of it.&amp;nbsp; Our expectation lies in the details:&amp;nbsp;

    Where and when?
    Who are you traveling with and who else is there?
    What adults are there to supervise, quaint as that sounds?
    Is there a purpose for the event, such as cast/graduation/sweet 16 party, jam session?
    Who&#39;s doing the driving?
    If we agree and there are any changes in plans, then contact us to clarify again.&amp;nbsp; Changes in circumstances can also change responses.

This last point about changes in plans sounds simple and it really should be.&amp;nbsp; Except that teens also lack judgment and in their minds, permission given is final.&amp;nbsp; So what if the get&#45;together is now moving more than twenty miles away, to be held at Jack&#39;s house?&amp;nbsp; Jack apparently has no last name and is only known by his attendance at Catholic High, hence Jack Catholic.&amp;nbsp; You said that I could and I can handle myself anyway.&amp;nbsp; No, I don&#39;t where he lives but I can always follow someone else...&amp;nbsp; This mistaken presumption leads to surprise on the parents&#39; part and if the response isn&#39;t handled gently &#45; not always a harried parent&#39;s strong suit &#45; it&#39;s met by wounded pride and testiness.&amp;nbsp; Events then proceed to roll downhill to mutual silence and quiet anger.
I have no surefire, easy way to handle circumstances like these.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not easy to consistently stay mellow, but one has to try.&amp;nbsp; The only other avenue is to follow the encounter with a later, gentler conversation that tries to make things right.&amp;nbsp; After these repeated encounters, there will hopefully be a reasonable &amp;quot;meeting of the minds&amp;quot; to help maintain the family peace.

<title>Student Loans:&nbsp; They&#8217;ll Want the Money Back</title>
<body>More people are aware of the serious issue with student debt, especially with the non&#45;dischargeable nature of the debt.&amp;nbsp; But with this era of too many societal promises/too little money, I was surprised at the report that the US Department of Education actually requested a SWAT team raid a house looking for a delinquent borrower.&amp;nbsp; There are a few caveats that I&#39;ll provide as I link this article:

    It&#39;s from the Drudge Report, which presumes a certain sensational quality about the news or it wouldn&#39;t be there;
    It&#39;s highly unlikely that such an overkill raid was solely in response to a simple delinquency situation.&amp;nbsp; Did the borrower have a history of making threats or carrying weapons?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s much that&#39;s not disclosed in the article and it would be helpful to know, although I doubt that we ever will.
    Were there other issues, such as fraud in a large amount?
    Another news report states that the Department of Education denied that it pertained to delinquent loans, but instead to a criminal investigation.&amp;nbsp;

The feds asked for a raid and got it, but no explicit reason as to why.&amp;nbsp;
There is something to take away from this article however.&amp;nbsp; While I don&#39;t expect there to be routine raids on a parent&#39;s house because Junior is now a year late on repaying the student loans &#45; the default rate is now more than 13% &#45; they will want the money back and will actively take measures to obtain it.&amp;nbsp; The Internal Revenue Service hired more staff to pursue tax revenues and there is no doubt that the same will happen here.&amp;nbsp; In this new world, the money will be most actively pursued from the most voiceless and least organized, the young.
This is something that I&#39;ll remember as we consider the higher education alternatives.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Greece and the Family</title>
<body>Online news feeds are running frequent reports about the financial situation in Greece, which has now spilled over into the political arena.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m watching with renewed interest&amp;nbsp;because:&amp;nbsp; (1)&amp;nbsp; we&#39;re taking the family there in three weeks, and;&amp;nbsp; (2)&amp;nbsp; it&#39;s a probable preview of what&#39;s going to happen here if we don&#39;t quickly and decisively put our own house in order.&amp;nbsp; Greece, ancient birthplace of democracy, is now deciding whether people have sovereignty or must literally surrender it to a foreign central bank and financial complex.
As crowds in excess of 100,000 protest before the Vouli ton Ellinon&amp;nbsp;(Hellenic Parliament) in Syntagma Square and the random tear gas canister is tossed around like a hackisack, I&#39;ve started monitoring the State Department website for any official travel advisory.&amp;nbsp; While we&#39;ve saved and planned for this Italy/Greece trip for two years, we also purchased trip insurance with an eye toward the greek situation.&amp;nbsp; The kids are hepped for Santorini and Athens, but wafting tear gas isn&#39;t as appetizing as fresh baklava.&amp;nbsp; The second that we see a travel advisory, that portion of the trip will either be changed or abandoned and we&#39;ll fall back to the trip insurance.
While not as visceral, Greece&#39;s economic predicament also causes real concern since it&#39;s a likely preview of coming attractions in this country.&amp;nbsp; The MSM line is that Greece brought it&#39;s present circumstances on itself with excessively generous &#45; and unsupportable &#45; social benefits.&amp;nbsp; Combine that with tax evasion as a national pastime second only to soccer and there&#39;s a recipe for fiscal disaster.&amp;nbsp; Americans are used to contending with the IRS so there&#39;s no sympathy for people who avoid taxes like a vegetarian avoiding a Big Mac.&amp;nbsp; This combo was the situation when Greece was admitted to the single European currency &#45; the Euro &#45; in 2000 and in turn gave up their own currency, the Drachma.&amp;nbsp;
This move promised benefits, but came at a price.&amp;nbsp; Member European nations had to agree to controlling both&amp;nbsp;their inflation rates and their national debt load as a percentage of their respective GDP.&amp;nbsp; While this wasn&#39;t a problem for the Northern European countries, it was understood that the PIGS in the south (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain) would have their work cut out for them.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, not only did the Greeks not meet their requirements, but it then became known that they engaged in sophisticated currency manuevers with Goldman Sachs to hide the amount of debt owed.&amp;nbsp; Their national debt was several times higher than had been previously reported, thanks to the GS folks.&amp;nbsp; For a better illustration, picture GS as the guys who worked with a contestant on The Biggest Loser to rig the scale, so that the winner only lost 100 pounds instead of the 225 previously reported.&amp;nbsp; Big eaters that they are, the Germans were truly torqued.
As global business slowed in 2008, the Greeks were caught in a bind.&amp;nbsp; Their spending required more foreign loans but the lenders were in too deep to take any further chances and this subsequently shifted the focus from private foreign bank lenders, who were as holed as their American counterparts, to the European nations and the European Central Bank.&amp;nbsp; The present riots&amp;nbsp;are because the common Greek now sees their&amp;nbsp;personal and sovereign futures as hostage to the whims of the monied minority, the plutocracy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The lenders want to assure repayment and demand a rollback of social benefits and improved tax collection, which the Greeks have readily abused.&amp;nbsp; But the lenders have also shot themselves in the foot by voicing their willingness to extend loans if&amp;nbsp;the Greeks are willing to&amp;nbsp;sell their public assets and infrastructure to the highest foreign&amp;nbsp;bidder, literally leaving the Greeks as tenants in their own lands.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Athenians can have a water system, but it&#39;ll be owned by&amp;nbsp;a German bank or the Athens International Airport is sold to a French concern.&amp;nbsp; All of the money will subsequently flee the country and condemn the average Greek to a life of debt servitude.&amp;nbsp; At this moment, the Greek government is actively deciding what properties can be sold to the&amp;nbsp;highest bidder.&amp;nbsp; For a proud, ancient nation, it sticks in the craw to have an historic site named like an NFL stadium...and on the left, you&#39;ll see the Heineken Acropolis, presently closed for Oktoberfest.&amp;nbsp; So the Greeks do what they do well, they hit the streets.
Can that really happen here however?&amp;nbsp; Hell, yes.

    Each nation has difficulties with the national debt, largely as a result of social benefits now viewed as sacred &#45; Medicare, Social Security &#45; and requiring renegotiation on a generational level.
    Each nation needs foreign lenders to provide funds.&amp;nbsp; Technically, the Federal Reserve is now the largest lender to the Treasury, but once the oil producers recognize it, the dollar is going to be toasted (Damn, I shot my mouth off again.&amp;nbsp; Good thing the Saudis aren&#39;t reading this...).
    Each nation has advocates stating that the debt really isn&#39;t an issue since there are plenty of physical assets to be sold.&amp;nbsp; Yes, there have been talking heads on CNBC stating that we can meet our&amp;nbsp;obligations by selling our national assets out from under us.&amp;nbsp; And on our left, the Heineken Lincoln Memorial, closed for Oktoberfest.&amp;nbsp;
    Each nation has a citizenry that has largely left it&#39;s future income streams to government payments.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of scared 60 year olds in both Athens, Greece and Athens, Georgia who are terrified of losing their old age benefits.
    Each nation has a growing sense that their future is now out of their hands and into the hands of a financial plutocracy, answerable to no real political authority.

While it can happen here, there&#39;s no guarantee that it will.&amp;nbsp; So while the&amp;nbsp;kids and wife are watching the tourist sites, I&#39;ll be watching the crowds&amp;nbsp;to see&amp;nbsp;how things shake out.&amp;nbsp;

<title>The College Debt Meme Spreads</title>
<body>More and more has been written in the past two years about the college conundrum &#45; it&#39;s economically important, but the debtload is a killer than can easily offset the benefits &#45; and now the word has become a meme percolating through society.&amp;nbsp; There comes a point where the talk finally, slowly, takes root even amongst those who&#39;ve been amongst the status quo and in this case, it&#39;s the guidance counselors.
Eldest is a junior now immersed in the college search process, dutifully visiting a few schools that interest her and round&#45;filing the hundreds of mailers and letters that come to the house.&amp;nbsp; What she&#39;s noticing however, is that the guidance counselors at her school are actively talking to her peers and suggesting that perhaps the better option isn&#39;t just going off to college as their predecessors did.&amp;nbsp; The new advice is to seriously consider what you want to do and then take the lower level general education courses at the local university/community college.&amp;nbsp; This is a far cry from what I heard several decades ago &#45; there&#39;s plenty of money out there and if you and your parents have to take some debt, it&#39;s easily repayable &#45; and is driven by three principal factors:

    The cost of higher education is significantly than decades ago because the rate of inflation for college tuition is about twice that of standard inflation as measured by the CPI.&amp;nbsp;
    Families no longer have the job/retirement security that they previously had, and the job market can&#39;t provide enough jobs that allow the graduate to both repay the debt and become economically independent.
    College debt is different from other forms of debt in that it can never be discharged in bankruptcy, but will follow the graduate until repayment or death.

This has now begun to dawn upon the educational establishment and they&#39;re finally passing the word along to the kids.&amp;nbsp; It would be wonderful to see a Deus ex machina moment in which this reality is magically altered and the situation is simply fixed, but reality doesn&#39;t work that way.&amp;nbsp; Real life works in fits and starts, veering one way and then another until a course is finally determined upon which allows progress to be made over time until a new equilibrium is reached.&amp;nbsp; But one of the key elements is that when those within a system begin to quietly influence many small changes that cumulatively determine a larger outcome, and if the guidance counselors are actually pushing this, then I draw some comfort from that.
There is no magic answer to this situation as it&#39;s one has been developing for decades.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve hollowed out our economy via outsourcing.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve ignored the long term investments in pursuit of consumption and shortterm&amp;nbsp; gratification, so there are no savings for the future.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve permitted the financial sector to usurp control of the economic and political process to the detriment of our society.&amp;nbsp;
Huh?
If you don&#39;t think that that&#39;s the case,&amp;nbsp;ask yourself why it&#39;s perfectly legal &#45; and considered a good business model &#45; to toss easy credit to young people with no experience?&amp;nbsp; Then ask why it&#39;s legal for this politically voiceless group to be the one group that is saddled with the most pernicious debt, debt that they can&#39;t escape but provides the lenders with a constant cash flow?&amp;nbsp;
When the process is bought and paid for, then don&#39;t expect sudden miracles.&amp;nbsp; But take comfort in the knowledge that slowly the word is spreading, now amongst the educational establishment.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Food Inflation Accelerating in June</title>
<body>Measuring a grocery basket of 47 items, the June PracticalDad Price Index came in at 103.18, up more than 1% from the May result of 102.08.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;result means that the market basket&#39;s price is up more than 3% from November 2010 and is a significant acceleration from the previous months&#39; results.&amp;nbsp; The average cost of the market basket, calculated from results surveyed at three separate grocery stores, was $184.07 and&amp;nbsp;a $5.68&amp;nbsp;increase from the original November basket cost of $178.39.
Following is a synopsis of the previous monthly results.

There are several notable results from the June survey.

    For the first time since the survey&#39;s inception in November, 2010, the majority of the basket items with price increases had rises in excess of 5% each as about 15% of the basket items had month&#45;to&#45;month rises greater than 5%.&amp;nbsp; In previous months, most results were due to a few items with significant increases &#45; coffee and canola oil, for instance &#45; while other items had much smaller increases.&amp;nbsp; This shifted in June however and if it becomes a trend, would indicate that food inflation is shifting from an isolated phenomenon to a mainstream condition.
    Canola oil &#45; a cooking oil that is also used as a biofuel and thus sensitive to oil prices &#45; increased again by 5.4% to $4.52 for a 48 oz bottle.&amp;nbsp; This is up from the November cost of $3.12 for the same size bottle, a 45% increase in 8 months.&amp;nbsp; While the typical family might use&amp;nbsp;another oil, such as corn or vegetable oil, canola oil is prevalent in the baked goods industry.&amp;nbsp; While the price of flour has been largely static since November, bread/roll costs have risen by almost 10% and this is most likely attributable to the canola oil&amp;nbsp;in its production.
    Coffee was unchanged for the first time since January.
    Diapers had a small increase due to stealth inflation as one grocer maintained the same price while decreasing the number of diapers per box.
    Kitchen trash bags increased significantly after dropping from April to May.&amp;nbsp; Prices were steady in two of the three stores, but the item cost has swung from one month&amp;nbsp;to another&amp;nbsp;in the third store.&amp;nbsp; I have gone back and verified that the correct price was surveyed at that particular supermarket each month and these prices were correct.&amp;nbsp; Even removing that particular item, there was a higher number of items with price increases greater than 5% than in any previous month and that finding holds.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Permitting Self-Defense</title>
<body>Is there a point at which it&#39;s morally correct to permit a child to take off the gloves in dealing with a bully?
The local school district teaches my children that violence isn&#39;t the answer and that it&#39;s wrong.&amp;nbsp; I agree with that and teach it as well.&amp;nbsp; But the school teaches that it&#39;s so wrong, in fact, that anyone found participating in violence will be dealt with summarily and harshly.&amp;nbsp; This includes the child who didn&#39;t start the altercation, has a back against the wall and is forced to throw a punch in self&#45;defense.&amp;nbsp; Middle once asked the elementary school guidance counselor, what if I&#39;m against the wall and being beaten?&amp;nbsp; Can I defend myself?&amp;nbsp; The counselor&#39;s response was no, yell for an adult to come help.&amp;nbsp; Well, he continued, what if there&#39;s no adult around?&amp;nbsp; The response was the same:&amp;nbsp; yell for an adult to come help.&amp;nbsp; Here is where we part ways since there are moments&amp;nbsp;when the adults aren&#39;t&amp;nbsp;immediately available and if they are, they might not be effective in dealing with the issue.&amp;nbsp;So while I fully agree with the district that violence&amp;nbsp;must be&amp;nbsp;addressed, and forcefully, is there ever an instance when&amp;nbsp;violent self&#45;defense is&amp;nbsp;actually acceptable?
First, how can I say that adult aides might not be present or effective?&amp;nbsp; There are certainly playground aides charged with maintaining the peace, but we&#39;ve got first hand experience with playground aides simply saying stop that and then turning away as the mayhem continues.&amp;nbsp; To be fair, this wasn&#39;t in this school district but at a Christian school at which playground aides would tell out&#45;of&#45;control boys to stop doing something and then pray for the budding axe murderers as the pain&#45;inducing behavior continued.&amp;nbsp; The disorder led to my conversation with the principal and my wife&#39;s discussion with the teacher &#45; whose son was one of the bullies &#45; when some order when finally restored.
The adults prayed as one of my kids was victimized, so yes, I can attest that adults might not be effective.&amp;nbsp; Even in this district, there are children whose recurrent behavior is violent and disruptive, apparently resistant to school discipline.
Violence should be roundly condemned, but again, is there ever an instance in which it is acceptable?
It&#39;s not an academic question for the household, especially with Youngest, whose class attracts Hell&#39;s spawn like honey draws flies.&amp;nbsp; Every classroom has problem children with whom teachers and children alike have to contend, but Youngest has already had to learn to deal with a child who hired an older boy to beat him up and that was in first grade.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, he managed the immediate situation&amp;nbsp;better at seven years of age better than many adults would have in similar circumstances.&amp;nbsp; But this year,&amp;nbsp;a true troublemaker not only came to Youngest&#39;s class,&amp;nbsp;he also moved into a nearby abode so that at midyear, he was not only at school, but wandering through the neighborhood and annoying all of the kids.&amp;nbsp; The child &#45; a third grader &#45; would simply stay at someone&#39;s house and refuse to leave and one set of parents simply let him spend the night since he refused to go home.&amp;nbsp; They were scared to deal with him and simply let him stay.&amp;nbsp; Why this didn&#39;t become a situation for social services is beyond me.&amp;nbsp;
His school record was even worse and Youngest had to&amp;nbsp;testify to the school administration when he heard the child make threats against other classmates, some of&amp;nbsp;those threats being&amp;nbsp;sexually aggressive.&amp;nbsp; He routinely threatened other children and even grabbed Youngest and threw him into lockers, threatening to punch him out.&amp;nbsp; At this point, Youngest&#39;s response was simply go ahead and punch me.&amp;nbsp; Youngest is significantly larger than the child and the&amp;nbsp;kid pulled back; Youngest had no real further problems with him after that, so much so that the child began showing up after school in our driveway to shoot basketball.&amp;nbsp;
It was clear that any parental oversight was minimal and we knew from another situation that he&#39;d been locked out of his apartment with literally nowhere to go.&amp;nbsp; The family line became that he could shoot hoops with Youngest if either myself or Middle &#45; a middle schooler &#45; was present but that he couldn&#39;t enter the house and had to adhere to family rules, such as controlling the language and it was here that he was warned off on several occasions by both Middle and myself.&amp;nbsp; After more language issues, he was warned off and I told him one night that he finally had to go.&amp;nbsp; Youngest made it clear as well that he was no longer welcome at the house and the basketball sessions ended and the most that we saw of the child was when he&#39;d cut through the yard to go elsewhere in the neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; Since then, he&#39;ll try to chat with Middle but cusses out Youngest and insults both him and our family and he sees no conflict in this contrariness.&amp;nbsp;
Yell for an adult.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m generally around, Youngest is now old enough that I&#39;m comfortable leaving him for a short period to run to the grocery and it was during one of these instances that he came around the back of the house to find the bully hiding in a corner of the garage behind the sports/toy rack, which he&#39;d been rifling.&amp;nbsp; Youngest told him to leave and he did so immediately.&amp;nbsp; When describing the situation to me upon my return, Youngest stated simply that if it happened again, he&#39;d punch him out.&amp;nbsp; My response was a simple, curt you won&#39;t have any problem with me on that.&amp;nbsp; Since then however, we&#39;ve made it a point to keep the garage door closed if we&#39;re not outside and the kid has simply walked past the house.
I am bothered by the response however.&amp;nbsp; I believe that the school&#39;s zero tolerance is understandable, but that it ultimately breeds victims, people who spend their time searching for someone else to handle the bullies that come through.&amp;nbsp; We have the right to defend ourselves and our property and the reality is that &amp;quot;adults&amp;quot; aren&#39;t always going to be around.&amp;nbsp; The alternative however, is that this kid truly is a budding sociopath for whom there are no qualms about escalating violence with a peer and this is where I&#39;ve gone back to Youngest.&amp;nbsp; Should it happen again, then call for me first and let me handle the issue.&amp;nbsp; Even if the kid takes off, I have no qualms about confronting parents and have done so before; I&#39;ll be the &amp;quot;bad guy&amp;quot; here.&amp;nbsp; But if I&#39;m not around, then he&#39;s clear to do what he thinks is necessary at the moment and I&#39;ll support him, even if that means that he&#39;s throwing a punch.&amp;nbsp;
If it ever comes to that, I guarantee that Youngest will be painted as the villain.&amp;nbsp; I also guarantee that I&#39;ll support my son to the hilt when it comes to this particular problem child.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Honey, I Shrank the Empire (About Damned Time, Too)</title>
<body>In a recent speech, retiring Secretary of Defense Robert Gates noted that with significant cuts in defense spending, American influence would diminish and wane&amp;nbsp;in the future.&amp;nbsp; My only response is, yep.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;m not clear if that&#39;s such a bad thing.&amp;nbsp;
Our nation has been around for 235 years, but we&#39;ve only been in imperial mode for the past several decades.&amp;nbsp; Our forefathers purposefully wanted us out of foreign entanglements and I&#39;ve come to conclude that they were correct; the only time that our forefathers were involved internationally was the Barbary War, when we fought pirate states to preserve American trade and even then, some argued that paying tribute was still cheaper than building and maintaining a navy.&amp;nbsp; Jefferson, Madison and Washington would be spinning like tops in their graves if they could see the status of our military establishment and foreign agreements.&amp;nbsp; Human nature being what it is, being #1 &#45; woot! &#45; places a giant target upon your back and the target has been getting rather heavy after several decades.&amp;nbsp;
Everybody wants to be #1 with their giant foam camoflage fingers jutting into the air, but good thing or not, the reality is that we can simply no longer afford&amp;nbsp;the extensive global military establishment.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s be honest, the defense spending is only one &#45; smaller &#45; part of the fiscal picture as the bulk of the federal budget is tied up in entitlement programs that need to reworked with the social contract.&amp;nbsp; But it is still spending that begs the question, do we really need this?&amp;nbsp; Do we really need forces remaining in Europe?&amp;nbsp; Do we really need bases in more than 100+ different countries?&amp;nbsp; In a far more low&#45;tech series of opponents, do we really need the exceptionally costly, high&#45;tech weapons systems?&amp;nbsp; What about the Chinese?&amp;nbsp;
Folks, the Chinese have their own problems with which to contend.&amp;nbsp; Besides, they&#39;re so busy tying up natural resource contracts globally that if we really wanted to have a war with them, we&#39;d be borrowing barrels of oil from them within the month just to run our planes.&amp;nbsp; Think about it:&amp;nbsp; there&#39;s a decent chance that a future war would be about obtaining natural resources that would be principally used in wartime by our military.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve had more than 35 years since the first oil crisis to recognize that we&#39;ve got a problem, and we&#39;ve done nothing to truly address that problem.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, but while I truly do support the military &#45; I didn&#39;t serve since my Korean War veteran father talked me out of it &#45; I see no reason to sacrifice our young people for oil, resources, or peacekeeping someone else&#39;s family feud.&amp;nbsp; The great majority of Americans can&#39;t recall who won Super Bowl XXXIII but there are those around the world who remember exactly who stole the family goat in 1598.&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t need to send Mike and Austin to settle the goat feud.&amp;nbsp;
A significant part of our economic problem is that we simply spend too much for foreign merchandise while they buy far less of our stuff.&amp;nbsp; The balance of trade data also shows that much of our imports aren&#39;t even for the crap sold in Walmart; we spend it on oil purchased from other nations.&amp;nbsp; If we were able to put significant dents in those oil purchases, that would be money that&amp;nbsp;could be used for other purposes &#45; or even better, not spent at all.&amp;nbsp; There would be less worry about oil supply lines which would diminish the need for the overwhelming foreign involvement and&amp;nbsp;voila!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A positive cycle is born.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no conceivable way that we can simply decide to cut out $1.2T without huge pain; it would be akin to saying that we can lose that pesky forty pounds by simply amputating the right leg.&amp;nbsp; But there can be significant and phased changes made to actually help.&amp;nbsp; A greatly lessened dependency upon foreign energy sources would lessen the need for the military force structure.

    Establish clear goals on energy usage and oil purchases.
    Determine what&#39;s required to meet those goals.
    We are capable of acting in the common interest if properly led.&amp;nbsp; Time is running short and any&amp;nbsp;plan would require a Manhattan Project/Apollo effort to meet the goals that steer us away from the overwhelming energy usage and subsequent dependency on foreign oil sources.&amp;nbsp; Take the money spent on&amp;nbsp;defense and put it into&amp;nbsp;energy, and projects that&amp;nbsp;are usable now.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Why not a&amp;nbsp;new energy infrastructure?&amp;nbsp; Ninety years ago, the mantra was a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage; why not solar/wind on every house?&amp;nbsp;
    Start now with the kids &#45; always, always, always the kids &#45; and begin to talk constantly about the need to both conserve and think outside the energy box.&amp;nbsp; They are the ones who are going to inherit an America that&#39;s very different than that with which we were raised and the more that they hear about it, the easier time that they&#39;ll have to adjust to it.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;Our choices ahead are going to be painful as we renegotiate the social contract.&amp;nbsp; What do we owe our senior citizens and what do we owe our children?&amp;nbsp; What do we owe a generation that has been&amp;nbsp;terrible in preparing for the future and how do we wean ourselves of a consumer mentality that&#39;s akin to a locust swarm in it&#39;s willingness to devour everything?&amp;nbsp; The real money available to us is going to become very dear and if we spend too much of our wealth&amp;nbsp;maintaining what is arguably an empire, we&#39;ll be consumed by the cancer that&#39;s grown within.
And for the record, Mike and Austin are real young men entering the military.&amp;nbsp;

<title>Old Dog, New Sports</title>
<body>Fatherhood is frequently an exercise in living outside of your comfort zone and as kids grow, new situations keep kicking you out of the zone just when you think that you&#39;re finally in it.&amp;nbsp; Much of that is due to the variety and prevalence of youth sports.&amp;nbsp;
Kids want to try new things and with only a few guidelines &#45; you start the season, you finish the season whether you like it or not &#45; that&#39;s what we encourage.&amp;nbsp; There are a wider variety of sports available now than when I was in high school and that means that more than a few fathers are on a learning curve as the nascent high school programs begin building rec league feeder programs to develop a pool of upcoming players with skills.&ampamp;nbsp; Those few&amp;nbsp;fathers with experience step up and help coach, both the kids and the other fathers who don&#39;t have experience.&amp;nbsp;
This was the case this weekend as we trooped to a high school in another county to watch MIddle participate in a volleyball tournament at the middle school level.&amp;nbsp; Because that level is only a club sport in our area, there are few teams and in this particular instance, we entered the high school gym to find that the other two teams were the individual grade teams for the host school district.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each was composed of the same number of boys as Middle&#39;s team while&amp;nbsp;Middle&#39;s team also includes several very talented upper elementary school boys who are already developing wicked serves.&amp;nbsp; My own previous experience was limited to smacking a ball around with neighborhood kids and in my twenties, watching female beach volleyball on ESPN.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve at least expanded my knowledge base since &#45; unlike with women&#39;s beach volleyball &#45;&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m actually watching the course of play and have managed to puzzle out certain rudiments of the game such as general positions and why net serves can actually be playable.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also refreshing to see the kids slap hands and buck each other up when things don&#39;t go well, a far cry from my own scholastic days of Helen Keller could&#39;ve caught that pass, you dumbass.
As the small cadre of families entered the gymnasium and sat down, we were able to look at the various sports history banners that decorated the walls as they do at every high school.&amp;nbsp; The Boys Volleyball banner revealed that this school had championship teams back to the early 1960s, when they still had to inflate the balls with blacksmith bellows, and I wondered whether I&#39;d have to find a local pharmacy to purchase first aid supplies for what promised to&amp;nbsp;be a ritual bloodletting.&amp;nbsp; As boys and families watched this volleyball machine run through it&#39;s clockwork drills, one father commented that they needed to start since our guys were getting psyched out watching this display of efficiency and I could only concur.&amp;nbsp; It was like&amp;nbsp;watching the visiting University of Nebraska football team warm up prior to gametime with your kid&#39;s team at Hooterville Community College.&amp;nbsp; As one&amp;nbsp;midwestern university student pep club banner once read in the early 1990s, Maintain Dignity Against Nebraska.
The first game was a walkaway and a clinic for Middle&#39;s team but as play continued, gears began to mesh and actual volleys took place as players found their groove and began playing as a team.&amp;nbsp; Adjustments were made after the first two games and suddenly, scores became respectable and games were actually won as the other side proved that they were middle school boys as well.&amp;nbsp; Man, that girl in the third row is smokin&#39; &#45;&amp;nbsp;what ball?&amp;nbsp; By the end of the afternoon, there was grace and fluidity on both sides of the net and as one father commented to me, you really have to watch it to appreciate and understand it.&amp;nbsp;
So I&#39;ll go outside the comfort zone again, as I did with basketball and baseball.&amp;nbsp; I won&#39;t pretend that I can handle the physical and coaching side of the house, which is what often happens with so many sports as fathers step up to spend their evenings watching instructional videos and reading Idiot Guides.&amp;nbsp; There are other opportunities to help and one of those opportunities will be filled somehow.&amp;nbsp; Rules will be learned and games dissected as happens already with soccer and baseball.&amp;nbsp;
Who knows?&amp;nbsp; Perhaps someday, Middle will find himself helping drill rudiments into a pack of small kids, slapping their hands when they smack the ball in the direction of the net.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; The Kids&#8217; Friends</title>
<body>If there&#39;s anything that gives me heartburn, it&#39;s the concern about the choices that the kids make for friends.&amp;nbsp; It really is true what they say:&amp;nbsp; you&#39;re judged by the company that you keep and one bad apple can spoil the barrel.&amp;nbsp; I used to think that it was just my own parents&#39; old school cynicism and closed&#45;mindedness, but I now accept it with the same faith that I acknowledge the sun&#39;s rising in the east.&amp;nbsp; How do I manage to keep tabs on who&#39;s coming in the door next and how do I somehow separate them from someone who really is a rolling, bleeding, god&#45;awful trainwreck?
Let me start by saying that over the years, I&#39;ve come to believe that in many cases, the problem isn&#39;t necessarily the children so much as it is the parents.&amp;nbsp; Absentee parents, lackadaisical parents, parents&#45;who&#45;are&#45;trying&#45;too&#45;hard&#45;to&#45;be&#45;buddies, no&#45;accountability parents &#45; there are a plethora of bad parents out there.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not perfect.&amp;nbsp; I tend to crankiness and impatience and I don&#39;t suffer fools as easily as I once did.&amp;nbsp; When talking with a child&#39;s friend about why he was failing a class, the response from both child and friend was that the teacher had it out for the friend ever since his marriage went on the rocks and he couldn&#39;t find a good woman.&amp;nbsp; My&amp;nbsp;response was so let me get this straight.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re failing a class because your teacher can&#39;t get laid?&amp;nbsp; For the record, both are teens and sometimes, an earthy response will cut through layers of nonsense.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, I&#39;m witnessing any number of kids whose parents are&amp;nbsp;not serving them well&amp;nbsp;and I know this because my own kids are bringing them home.&amp;nbsp; It used to be that there was common ground amongst parents and most kids were raised in a manner with common values and common expectations; this has degraded enough so that kids are doing things that were once considered &#45; at best &#45; inappropriate but they&#39;re clueless because no one has actually taken&amp;nbsp;the time or effort to teach them otherwise.
So how do I work through the heartburn?&amp;nbsp; After all, it only increases as they age and my ability to monitor and control correspondingly decreases.&amp;nbsp; As they age and grow, their friends do the same and they all come under the wider influences of the outside world via increased media exposure, older siblings and even families that break apart over the course of time.&amp;nbsp;

    Listen explicitly for names and through discussion and further listening, determine who these various children are and the context in which I&#39;m hearing about them.&amp;nbsp; Even if I don&#39;t hear their names for awhile, I&#39;ll resurrect them in conversation just to hear what&#39;s happened with them.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s through this that I&#39;ve learned who&#39;s transferred out, who&#39;s wound up in the principal&#39;s office and who&#39;s even starting to go with whom.
    If certain names crop up repeatedly, actually find a reason to visit the class so that I can put a face with this name and take some measure of the child.&amp;nbsp; Given two particular names that I was hearing through the Fall semester, I happily agreed to join Youngest for his school lunch so that I could put faces with names and behaviors.
    Chat with neighbors and other parents to cross&#45;reference stories on children and teens and learn more about them.&amp;nbsp; It sounds sneaky at times, but having grown up in a small town, I guarantee that both my parents were cross&#45;referencing with other parents to gain a better sense of who&#39;s out there.&amp;nbsp; I was passing along information to another parent the other evening.&amp;nbsp; On one level, it sounds like gossip but the reality is that we&#39;re talking about behaviors and things that have happened, which was the tenor of the most recent conversation.&amp;nbsp; Because the schools are rightfully prohibited from discussing individual student behaviors, then comparing notes with other parents is about the only other way to keep tabs.
    Encourage the kids to bring their friends home to play so that you can put&amp;nbsp;faces to names and learn their personalities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our&amp;nbsp;old house had a much larger yard with swingset that was conducive to&amp;nbsp;outdoor play but the present house has a small, sloped yard that isn&#39;t kid friendly so Youngest heads across the way to play with buddies.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, we invested in redoing the basement and it&#39;s common to have&amp;nbsp;kids spending the night on weekends.&amp;nbsp; The point is to have the kids here as much as possible in order to put a face with a name and gain some sense.
    Take notes, especially if a child becomes a major concern.&amp;nbsp; When a child develops a friendship with someone, even a trainwreck, it&#39;s difficult to have to force a breakoff and the more ammunition that you have the easier that it&#39;ll&amp;nbsp;be.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s easier when they&#39;re little but becomes more difficult when they age.&amp;nbsp; In one particular circumstance, I had notes documenting seven particular instances in which the particular child had either lied, wound up in the principal&#39;s office or set another child up to fail and in a spectacular fashion.&amp;nbsp; Instead of telling my kid that I don&#39;t trust this child and he&#39;s trouble, I just walked through the instances and then stated that there would be no further contact outside of school.&amp;nbsp; While I expected argument, the response was muted and acknowledged since there were no arguments to counteract what were real events.&amp;nbsp; I wasn&#39;t working on gut or feelings, that kid had screwed up royally and my own could mount no defense.
    I try to keep my own commentary about a friend as calm as possible &#45; which can be difficult &#45; in order to keep my own child&#39;s defensiveness under control.&amp;nbsp; There have been a very few instances where my own comments have gone over the edge but I work hard to control derogatory remarks or unpleasant remarks; the point is to try to keep the lines of communication sufficiently open that I can continue to gather what facts and observations that I can.

Friends play a huge role in a child&#39;s development and there&#39;s no way that I can &#45; or should&amp;nbsp; &#45; pick all of my child&#39;s friends.&amp;nbsp; I can listen and observe and then work to help them make good choices.&amp;nbsp; I can even, on occasion, forbid further contact with someone else.&amp;nbsp; But they have to be able to learn to make good choices now and without some guidance, the odds of that happening are less than great.&amp;nbsp;
And we can&#39;t guide them when we can&#39;t see who else is out there on the horizon.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Paying the Kids?</title>
<body>As the kids age and want more financial independence &#45; but are still bound by child labor laws and a slack summer labor market &#45; how much should a parent participate?&amp;nbsp; Each of our kids receives an allowance, commensurate with age.&amp;nbsp; But they also want more as they age and that doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re just going to fork over more dollars, so how do we handle it given the parameters outlined?&amp;nbsp;
In our case, we&#39;re &amp;quot;fortunate&amp;quot; to live in a house with an exceptionally&amp;nbsp; demanding yard.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, I&#39;ve never bought a house with yardwork in mind but if I knew then what I know now, I&#39;d have thought twice about agreeing with my wife about purchasing it.&amp;nbsp; The previous owner was a gardening fanatic who did exquisite work, especially with the heavily sloped backyard.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, he spent all of his time on the yard and with three active kids, that simply hasn&#39;t been the case here.&amp;nbsp; The back was filled with a runner ivy that has simply overwhelmed and choked out everything and things are officially a mess.&amp;nbsp; While hiring a lawn service to handle the&amp;nbsp;yard and keep the back under control would be the easiest alternative, it&#39;s also the most expensive and one that teaches the worst possible lesson to the kids &#45; that unpleasant tasks can be farmed out to someone else and that money solves everything.&amp;nbsp; In a country whose economy is changing and income stagnating, it&#39;s the worst possible lesson of all.
In this case then, I decided to hire the kids to work alongside me.&amp;nbsp; From a conversation with friends this weekend, they thought that I was nuts since it was something for which they would clearly expect the kids to help.&amp;nbsp; In their view, such projects are part and parcel of the family and home life, where if you want something nice, then you have to help keep it that way.&amp;nbsp; While I appreciate the view, there&#39;s something about the scope of this project that takes it into a different category.&amp;nbsp; There are other aspects that led me to propose payment.

    If the kids want some extra money but I don&#39;t want to just shell it out, then they can earn money through hard work.
    The work will be done regardless, and the amount that they earn is a function of how much time that they&#39;re willing to put in on the project.&amp;nbsp; They want more, then they earn it and learn that pay depends upon performance.
    I&#39;m still saving money on the deal.&amp;nbsp; When we had someone lay mulch three years ago, it cost almost $2000 and took three grown men two full days to just lay the mulch and didn&#39;t even touch tearing out the existing foliage.
    This is a project and there will be a semblance of order to it, from start to finish.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s important for the kids to see that there&#39;s a method to doing something apart from just arbitrary tasks such as emptying trash and mowing the lawn.&amp;nbsp; This will also be a learning experience, much as Eldest&#39;s work to refurbish the god&#45;forsaken fish pond that abuts the back deck; it needs some annual maintenance but the savings from her tackling it &#45; and while we did it together, she did the lion&#39;s share &#45; were in the range of about $3500.
    Holding payment over their heads helps to keep me in the position of &amp;quot;boss&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Kids can and will become a bit contemptuous and shifting myself temporarily from father to boss will cut down on the backtalk and argument.&amp;nbsp; This is why I&#39;m doing this but if you really disagree, then don&#39;t get paid.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s life, kid.

This is going to be a major project and will entail a significant amount of work.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t going to be cheap but it will be far, far less than if I&#39;d hired an outsider to do the job and frankly, if the money is going somewhere, I&#39;d rather that it stay within the family.</body>

<title>The Gas Price Hits Home</title>
<body>With the average gas price now at $3.99/gallon and the average monthly gasoline bill at $368, families are starting to have to consider how to handle driving and this family is really no different.&amp;nbsp; But there are some things that are beyond our control, such as driving to work and getting to various activities.&amp;nbsp; Today was one of those examples.
All three kids are in different sports &#45; soccer, volleyball and baseball &#45; and for the first time in years, the soccer field is within two miles of the house.&amp;nbsp; Volleyball is at the high school, also near the house.&amp;nbsp; Baseball however, is played by the local Little League at practice and game fields located all over Hell and half of Georgia and there are no fields within even a relatively close distance and there&#39;s no option but to drive.&amp;nbsp; Today&#39;s situation arose as Eldest had a friend spend the night and our understanding was that the friend would come along to the game with us and we&#39;d return her home afterwards.&amp;nbsp; With a half hour drive to get to the field, we needed to leave at noon and at 11:55 AM, we found that the friend had to be home at noon.&amp;nbsp; Despite Eldest&#39;s insistence that we could just drop her off and then go to the game, it was necessary for me to leave first with Youngest for the game while Eldest and my wife took the friend home and then to the game separately.&amp;nbsp; We were consequently forced to use two cars to get to a single event when one would have been sufficient with decent planning.&amp;nbsp; This has now been hammered into Eldest&#39;s head.
It&#39;s ironic that Eldest has begun her driving career as I began mine &#45; at a time of high gas prices.&amp;nbsp; She was surprised to find that I filled up my tank the other day for $95 and it was reminiscent of my reaction when I found what my own father paid for a full tank in 1979.&amp;nbsp; But she and her peers haven&#39;t seemed to have caught on to some of the rules by which we played in the late 1970s.&amp;nbsp; The first rule is that if someone is driving someplace, it&#39;s appropriate for members of the party to help chip in for the gas.&amp;nbsp; The second rule is that people don&#39;t drive separately when carpooling is available.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t uncommon for someone to volunteer to drive and then pick up others.&amp;nbsp; These simple rules are ones that she and her peers will have to take to heart.
So what else will we try to do to keep things under control and below $368 a month?

    Have more explicit conversations about details before making a final decision, such as the exact time a friend needs to be home.&amp;nbsp; A few extra questions would have saved an extra car trip to the baseball game.
    Send the kids on bikes or walk more often to local, around&#45;town errands or destinations.&amp;nbsp; My mother recently gave me a pull cart with which to pull bags of groceries and this week, I&#39;ll start using it to walk to the local grocery for food and milk.
    Decide whether certain trips even need to be made and if so, whether there&#39;s alternative means.&amp;nbsp; Carpooling, maybe even buses?&amp;nbsp; Although to be honest, our area is not terribly well served by public transportation.
    Once Eldest actually has a regular paying job, decide whether she&#39;ll become responsible for the gas for the car.&amp;nbsp; At this point, she&#39;s wrapped up in schoolwork and volunteering and doesn&#39;t have the money for $95 in a gas tank.

Gas prices have gone up and down through the past thirty years.&amp;nbsp; But with the question of peak oil and the stagnant American family income, I&#39;m doubtful that it&#39;s going to be coming down again anytime soon so we&#39;ll have to think through the scenarios and adjust accordingly.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Index Rises to 102.08 as Coffee Keeps Perking Along</title>
<body>The PracticalDad Price Index (PDPI) rose slightly in May to 102.08 as both coffee and canola oil &#45; a cooking oil akin to vegetable oil &#45; posted gains of 7.2% and 4.9% respectively from April.&amp;nbsp; While these items had significant gains, the PDPI only&amp;nbsp;increased slightly from April&#39;s 101.97 due to&amp;nbsp;offsetting price decreases in&amp;nbsp;several items.&amp;nbsp; This constitutes a 2.08%&amp;nbsp;rise in the 46 item food basket since its inception in November of 2010.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Comments on the May pricing:

    The coffee increases were purely in price&amp;nbsp;alone with no&amp;nbsp;stealth inflationary practices of holding price&amp;nbsp;constant while decreasing package sizing.
    Canola oil rose again on the back of increased demand&amp;nbsp;from&amp;nbsp;biofuel&amp;nbsp;producers as the cost of crude oil&amp;nbsp;remains high.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Canola oil is used in baked products and since&amp;nbsp;crude oil began to rise, the price of&amp;nbsp;bread/rolls has risen more than 8% since November; these&amp;nbsp;products had no price changes this month, however.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    Flour continued flat while sugar, a commodity which has&amp;nbsp;risen in cost in&amp;nbsp;raw form, showed it&#39;s first sign of change with a small increase of 1.9%.&amp;nbsp; If sugar continues to rise, expect to see price increases in corollary&amp;nbsp;food products containing sugar, such as the store brand&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Frosted Flake&amp;quot; item.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    Orange Juice also showed an increase&amp;nbsp;of 3.8% as one store raised price while maintaining the package sizing.
    Store brand hot dogs rose 4%, the first bump in that product since the index inception in November.
    The per pound cost of a roaster chicken rose 1.9% while the cost of eggs jumped 8.8%.&amp;nbsp; Eggs have fluctuated in price however and are still below the high of $2.01/dozen in December, 2010 while the per pound cost is also below the high reached in February, 2011.&amp;nbsp;
    The cost of a box of trash bags dropped by 8.5% with decreases noted in two of the stores.&amp;nbsp; In the past several months, I&#39;ve noticed that these two stores have introduced ultra&#45;low cost household products into their stores.&amp;nbsp; These are typically the types of items that could be purchased in stores such as Dollar Tree or Dollar General and it could be that the grocery stores have introduced the lines to retain the customers who might otherwise take those purchases to the dollar stores.&amp;nbsp; In this case however, the bags continue to be store brand as they were before so it&#39;s possible that they&#39;ve found new, cheaper producers for their products.

<title>Yes, Babies - and Children - Are Hard</title>
<body>The Wall Street Journal is not the place that I&#39;d expect to find an article detailing the challenges of a baby to a marriage, Andrea Petersen&#39;s article is a good synopsis of the impact that children can have on a marriage.&amp;nbsp; My question however, why is this surprising?&amp;nbsp; What has changed in our society that we now think that it&#39;s not a challenge and considerable work to raise children?&amp;nbsp; Ms. Petersen does a good job of explaining the difficulties and providing some&amp;nbsp;tips on handling interpersonal issues, but it doesn&#39;t go to the deeper issue.
Let&#39;s be frank, children are work.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m the father of three and have been home with them since Eldest&#39;s birth, and I&#39;ll attest to the fact that they are work and can create considerable stress.&amp;nbsp; The nature of that work changes as they age with the physically intensive, demanding activities occurring when they&#39;re very young.&amp;nbsp; They grow and learn and can start handling more of the physical aspects themselves but the work becomes more intuitive and cerebral as they enter the world and begin to interact with other children and the remainder of society.&amp;nbsp; Accountancy can be as tiring as digging ditches, just in a different way.&amp;nbsp; Children can be great sources of joy, but that joy sometimes comes with considerable effort.
Why are we surprised at this simple reality of nature?

    Caring for babies and raising children is not only a physically demanding job, but one that entails considerable mental stress, especially in families where both parents are working.&amp;nbsp; Who&#39;s going to get Junior from daycare?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got to get this laundry folded and put away, assure that dinner&#39;s cooked and that&#39;s after I spend time playing with Junior.&amp;nbsp; People sometimes forget that play is an integral part of the parent&#39;s job that provides tremendous value to the child&#39;s development and that it really is part of their parental job.&amp;nbsp; The juggling can be stressful and requires constant vigilance to assure that things don&#39;t fall apart.&amp;nbsp; This juggling is made more difficult by the fact that you&#39;re dealing with children who simply don&#39;t see reality or think like adults with several decades of experience.&amp;nbsp; Stress can come from having to be somewhere and the small child decides to pitch a tantrum because the socks don&#39;t feel right or doesn&#39;t want to turn off the television program.&amp;nbsp; And I say this from not having to worry about covering multiple children along with a job.
    Media bombards us with images showing the glossy images of&amp;nbsp;children playing with parents, neat houses and happy families sitting down to mealtimes.&amp;nbsp; These are superficial however, since they don&#39;t show the laundry being ignored while Mom plays Chutes and Ladders, the constant picking up of toys and strewn clothing, and the time spent cooking the meals for those happy mealtimes.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s much work involved in running the household and managing the family and this isn&#39;t shown anywhere apart from commercials for cleaning items.&amp;nbsp; One of my complaints about shows such as Supernanny is that the disciplinary interventions are briefly discussed in the alloted timeframe and then there might be brief clips showing the parents putting them to use.&amp;nbsp; The reality of discipline however, is that it can take a long, long time to train the child to stay in the timeout spot as children will test the parent repeatedly.&amp;nbsp; They certainly don&#39;t show the desperate, often emotionally exhausted parent overcoming the urge to strangle the child.
    Not&amp;nbsp;only do we tend to fall for the images in the media, but we&#39;ve&amp;nbsp;been sold shallow definitions of home and family.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In a society that prizes time management and quick gratification, we&#39;ve forgotten that a home isn&#39;t a physical thing or place.&amp;nbsp; A home is a sense, a belief and a feeling.&amp;nbsp; It arises from our cumulative actions and attitudes instead of the workmanship of the carpenters and plumbers that completed the structure.&amp;nbsp; They simply provide the physical&amp;nbsp;structure from the elements but we take that structure and create a home in which to raise our children.&amp;nbsp; Homes are made, not built.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Likewise, if we accept&amp;nbsp;the modern notion that a family&amp;nbsp;can consist of more than two parents and biologically related children, then a family is&amp;nbsp;something that&amp;nbsp;is truly crafted and not just thrown together pell mell.
    With divorce so prevalent amongst&amp;nbsp;American marriages in the past two generations, many of today&#39;s young parents simply don&#39;t have a template&amp;nbsp;upon which to model what&#39;s involved in making a home and&amp;nbsp;marriage work.&amp;nbsp; Women do have a&amp;nbsp;biological nesting&amp;nbsp;instinct that, in a sense, predisposes them to understand what&#39;s involved but many&amp;nbsp;men simply don&#39;t have that.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Since most children stayed with the separated and divorced mom, daughters had a model upon which to base their own home and household experience.&amp;nbsp; More importantly, nor do&amp;nbsp;men have the&amp;nbsp;involved, active father figure upon which to model their own efforts and are, as a group, struggling to find themselves.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Honestly,&amp;nbsp;people don&#39;t recognize that enough factors have come together&amp;nbsp;to make it&amp;nbsp;difficult to be a young and involved&amp;nbsp;father in today&#39;s society.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    While Americans work hard, we live in a leisure based society and that breeds self&#45;absorption.&amp;nbsp; It took me awhile to understand that there&#39;s a First Law of Fatherhood and that&#39;s that it&#39;s no longer about me, but about these children that depend upon my wife and I for their survival and upbringing.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a mindset that takes some work to adopt and there are still moments when I&#39;d like to pack a bag and catch a train to New York for the weekend, but that means that the responsibilities to wife and kids are uncovered.&amp;nbsp; I can still take an occasional getaway by myself, but that&#39;s only after working through the logistics ahead of time.

For everything that I&#39;ve just written, please don&#39;t think that I resent the kids.&amp;nbsp; They are a blessing and I simply cannot conceive of a life without their presence for what they bring to me.&amp;nbsp; But there is a realistic understanding that&#39;s come about from&amp;nbsp;considerable effort and work, much of which was generated by these blessings.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Is College Necessary?</title>
<body>When times are tough, people get back to reality and again begin debating the value and merit of ideas and institutions and boy, are people starting to debate whether higher education in its present form is still worthwhile.&amp;nbsp; Given the cost, relative to income, and especially the non&#45;dischargeable nature of the student debt, it&#39;s a legitimate debate and one which I have in my own house.&amp;nbsp; Thus far, we&#39;ve raised the kids with the idea that they&#39;ll be attending college.&amp;nbsp; The high school/college graduate income levels are clearly skewed to the college side and with middle&#45;class American jobs steadily being eroded, we&#39;ve been clear that this is a necessity.&amp;nbsp; But in the past two years, I&#39;ve begun to question whether that college education has to happen immediately after high school or whether it should wait for a few years.&amp;nbsp; Is the degree itself the issue, or the classic out&#45;of&#45;high&#45;school means in which it&#39;s obtained?
Nobody &#45; and I mean nobody &#45; can say with certainty how the economy and job picture is ultimately going to shake out.&amp;nbsp; Will wages drop enough to make a manufacturing renaissance so that there&#39;s a huge demand for machinists and skilled craftsmen?&amp;nbsp; Will things stabilize so that we remain in a permanently stuck service economy?&amp;nbsp; What stays with my wife and I is that there is value in education, enough that a meaningful degree is worth the time and effort to obtain it.&amp;nbsp; The trick is to assure that it&#39;s meaningful and obtained in a way that doesn&#39;t bankrupt anybody.
In the New York Magazine article, certain points stand out.&amp;nbsp; Clearly, there&#39;s a lifetime&amp;nbsp;income disparity between high school and college graduates but it honestly never occurred to me to consider the impact of college debt weighing upon that college income.&amp;nbsp; Given that, I decided to play with some numbers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you research the average starting salary of a college graduate, the median income of a 2010 college graduate with a job related to their major was $35000 and the median income for someone with a non&#45;related job was only $25000.&amp;nbsp; With the average college graduate coming out with student debt of $24,000&amp;nbsp;and a typical repayment term of ten years at the Stafford loan rate of 6.8%, the monthly nut is about $276; according to federal debt/income ratios, this requires a minimum salary of $33,000 and is thus manageable for someone with a $35000 income.&amp;nbsp; Understand that the lesser wage of $25000 is specified as hourly.&amp;nbsp; According to the Heldrich study from Rutgers, after one year out of college, only 53% are employed full&#45;time with 14% in graduate school, 2% in the military and the remainder either unemployed or cobbling together what they can.
While I researched for this, there were any number of 2010 newspaper articles talking about how the average job offer for the 2010 graduate was around $50000 with&amp;nbsp;the unspoken upshot&amp;nbsp;that things were actually quite rosy.&amp;nbsp; Just remember however, that there&#39;s a difference between median and mean and a few truly high&#45;paying jobs can pull the mean (average) up and away from the median, which is where the average junior Joe Six&#45;Pack is going to be.
So where does that leave us, apart from having a disheartened adolescent in the house?

    As always, talk with the kids as they age about the mundane reality of personal finance.&amp;nbsp; Want a car?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s going to happen with auto insurance and gas?&amp;nbsp; How much is spent on&amp;nbsp;housing and the ancillary costs, such as utilities?&amp;nbsp; How is health insurance handled?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s this budgeting thingy and why doesn&#39;t it consist solely of electronic equipment upgrades?
    Step back and take an honest appraisal whether Junior is actually ready for college.&amp;nbsp; While the long&#45;term benefits of college still accrue in terms of overall wage, the stats above show that the short&#45;term pain is significant and could have a long&#45;term impact.&amp;nbsp; Have you talked with Junior enough that there&#39;s some semblance of a plan or is this just going to be the general&#45;education&#45;for&#45;two&#45;years&#45;and&#45;hopefully&#45;figure&#45;something&#45;out&#45;by&#45;Junior&#45;year approach?&amp;nbsp; If the latter, there&#39;s no shame in discussing whether to work for two years while Junior makes some decisions based upon the reality of the working world.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, the two summers that I spent pouring concrete were significant in recognizing that I wanted a college degree.&amp;nbsp; Besides, the only temporal restriction upon money stored in a 529 plan is that it&#39;s used by age 25 and not upon starting to use by age 19.&amp;nbsp;
    Work with them to determine alternatives.&amp;nbsp; While the kid might be 18 years of age, most at that age do not have the experience and knowledge base to help them figure out where to turn.&amp;nbsp; By the time that you&#39;re into your thirties however, you have a much better sense of where to go and with whom to talk to gather the information for a workable plan.&amp;nbsp; Also speak&amp;nbsp; honestly with them about whether their alternatives make sense.&amp;nbsp; When Eldest was in for her annual physical, the doctor inquired about what she was thinking for adulthood and when she responded in general terms, the physician agreed that that was workable given her grades and skills; I was surprised by the doctor&#39;s subsequent comment that the plan for many teens to whom she talked took the path of professional sports and endorsements.&amp;nbsp; If that&#39;s the case, then there are parents screwing up somewhere.
    Let them know that a &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; doesn&#39;t have to be set in stone with six month bullet points (although it would be lovely were it true) and can change as the need arises.&amp;nbsp; What matters is that there&#39;s a workable path to a rational destination.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also helpful to provide a little perspective from someone who&#39;s further down the lifepath than someone who&#39;s at the beginning and scratching their head.

There are no easy answers in an economy that&#39;s presently shifting gears from one model to another.&amp;nbsp; Change can entail significant pain and the unfortunate reality is that our young adults are among the ones suffering the pain, but the pain can be minimized with some clear thinking, time and perspective.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Preparing the Kids:&nbsp; A Non-American World</title>
<body>I flipped on my browser window and the Yahoo newspage appeared with the apocalyptic statement that America would be overtaken by China by 2016 and that the American age was finished.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, who&#39;s surprised at this?&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re a nation of more than 1 billion people with a state controlled capitalistic system with two goals &#45; to provide employment for more people than I can ever possibly count before I die and to overtake the United States to become the dominant global power and redress centuries of political impotence.&amp;nbsp; Us?&amp;nbsp; Well, not so much.&amp;nbsp; The realization of this happening has colored my thinking for years and has had some bearing on dealing with the kids, who will be making a living in a far more competitive world than either my father or I.&amp;nbsp; What can I do so that they&#39;re not surprised as many of their generation will be?
The reality is now clear after several years of a collapsing housing bubble and out&#45;of&#45;control public spending and debt.&amp;nbsp; The standard of living will decline and the competition for gainful, sustainable employment will only get harder.&amp;nbsp; What have I talked about and tried to inculcate with the kids?

    First, make them aware of the evolving situation by sharing news and even some of what I&#39;ve written with them.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re now conversant with the issue of college debt and are aware that it will follow them; they&#39;re also aware that while we&#39;ve saved for college, we aren&#39;t going to render ourselves destitute to&amp;nbsp; educate them.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re not on their own, but a significant amount is up to them and their efforts.
    Second, talk about current events with them.&amp;nbsp; Make sure that they&#39;re aware of the outside world, even if you turn off their electronics to read something to them.&amp;nbsp; That also means that I have to take the time to answer their questions and explain things.&amp;nbsp; The questions might come later instead of at that moment, so I make it a point to discuss things when they raise them.
    Third, hold them accountable for their grades.&amp;nbsp; Even if they don&#39;t think that grades matter in the real world, grades are &amp;quot;the coin of the realm&amp;quot; for determining future paths and present activities.&amp;nbsp; Activities can be stopped if the grades aren&#39;t maintained and truthfully, things have occasionally gotten nasty when grades have turned south for stupid reasons.
    Fourth, be frank with them about their strengths and weaknesses as they get older. When they were younger, I praised them for attributes and traits &#45; you&#39;re really smart, etc. &#45; but changed to praising them for their actions&amp;nbsp;so that the reinforcement pertains to their good actions.&amp;nbsp; After practicing baseball with Youngest one evening, I complimented him on his drive to repeat something until he got it right instead of heaping blanket praise about being a good ballplayer.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, make certain that they know when they&#39;ve screwed up.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, things happen but sometimes things happen because of our own failures and screwups.
    Fifth, help them to learn the difference between want and need.&amp;nbsp; This is purposefully blurred by the media and corporations but it will have to be relearned as money tightens.&amp;nbsp; For example, Youngest has his baseball pictures this weekend and while we&#39;ll buy some shots, I refused to order a bobblehead with his face imprinted on it on the grounds that it was simply crap.&amp;nbsp; Son, in four years it will be sitting in the Goodwill bin and even they won&#39;t take it because it&#39;s got your face on it.&amp;nbsp; Assuming it even survives four years.
    Sixth, help them to develop both moral and political beliefs.&amp;nbsp; We spend our time trying to teach morality, but the flip side of the issue is that our youngsters are largely illiterate about history and politics and that&#39;s the death knell of a civic nation.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t need them to vote or believe the same thing that I do, but I do challenge them with what do you think about this?&amp;nbsp; One is growing up to be fairly conservative while the younger sibling is a budding labor organizer and political radical.&amp;nbsp; More power to them, whatever they believe.
    Seventh, be sure to take the time to talk with them.&amp;nbsp; Chat with them, explain things to them, challenge them.&amp;nbsp; Even if you think that they&#39;ve tuned out, they&#39;re still listening and you&#39;ll recognize that in the oddest moments.&amp;nbsp;

There&#39;s no question that our nation will take economic second place to China within the next number of years.&amp;nbsp; While bad news sells and our media tendency is to overstate things, there will be major economic and financial changes and no change occurs without pain.&amp;nbsp; The competition will be fierce and there&#39;ll be real and significant adjustment to our way of life.&amp;nbsp; The best that we can do is to recognize it and pave the way beforehand so that they aren&#39;t blindsided.</body>

<title>Is Inflation Coming?&nbsp; McDonald&#8217;s Says&#8230;</title>
<body>Yes.
According to a brief news report, they are.&amp;nbsp; McDonald&#39;s executives, those responsible for more than 32000 restaurants globally and 14000 in the US alone, now acknowledge that rising prices for beef, dairy and other products are squeezing their margins and have updated their own inflation forecast to 4 &#45; 4.5% in the US and Europe alone.&amp;nbsp; Their problem is in figuring out how can pass the price increases along to a customer base that they also acknowledge to be squeezed, particularly when one of their key demographics is the young male &#45; you know, the guy whose age bracket is presently afflicted with an unemployment rate of more than 18% and the worst in more than 60 years of recordkeeping.&amp;nbsp;
This is more in keeping with what the PracticalDad Price Index has seen through six months of existence, with ground beef increasing 10% at the retail grocer level and bread products rising about 8%.&amp;nbsp; The buns &#45; bread products &#45; will be particularly affected by oil prices, but not for the reason that might be suspected.&amp;nbsp; Apart from the cost of transportation to get everything to the various locations, the baked products all contain some elements of vegetable oils.&amp;nbsp; These oils are sensitive to oil prices as the biofuel manufacturers use these as an offset to oil, so that more of the vegetable oils are purchased when oil rises.&amp;nbsp; Dairy costs are being passed along to teh corporation instead of teh consumer however, because milk prices are set at the retail level and cannot be apssed along.&amp;nbsp; There will come a point however, when the dairy producers scream loud enough about their input costs that the milk board will finally have to pass that along to the retail shopper and that particular product will rise as well.
Other restaurant chains, such as Yum&#39;s Chipotle Mexican Restaurant, are likewise seeing their wholesale costs rise but haven&#39;t been as successful at controlling them as their peers at McDonald&#39;s who apparently differ in that McD&#39;s will work hard to keep the prices down.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll see.
In the meantime, you might as well supersize while you can still afford it.

<title>Food Is Still Cheap, Now&#8230;</title>
<body>There&#39;s been much written in the financial and economic blogs about the prospect of inflation and it&#39;s effect upon the American middle class, and much of it is angst&#45;ridden and full of doom.&amp;nbsp; But prices are trending upwards for food &#45; I track a marketbasket of 46 different grocery items &#45; and it helps to keep some sense of perspective.&amp;nbsp; That having been said, I read Michael Deane&#39;s view of food inflation in the SFGate and while I appreciate the attempt to place it in perspective, it misses the practical point.
According to Deane, and he&#39;s technically correct, food prices aren&#39;t the boogeyman issue since Americans spend far less for food &#45; as a percentage of income &#45; than in most other areas of the world.&amp;nbsp; There are some regions where food accounts for upwards of 40 &#45; 50% of the family&#39;s budget, far higher than what an American family typically pays.&amp;nbsp; Reading Deane&#39;s article, the sense is that some prices will rise, but they aren&#39;t the cause for concern since we can always rejigger what we presently purchase.&amp;nbsp; Besides, there&#39;s so much more that we can conceivably handle given the little that we comparatively pay already.&amp;nbsp; But he views the issue too narrowly.

    We&#39;ve built a highly complex economic system &#45; almost chaotic in the scientific sense &#45; in which things are connected in an intricate web.&amp;nbsp; Why does something which occurs in Fukushima have a bearing on next year&#39;s homeowner&#39;s insurance rates?&amp;nbsp; Foodstuffs are woven into the web and the disgruntled Arab student waving his arms in Saudi Arabia most definitely creates a breeze in the bread aisle.&amp;nbsp; What is affected elsewhere will probably find its way into the food arena.
    Many Americans, particularly parents, are scared because they understand that the average income is flat at best and the economic future for our children is not as good as it was for future generations.&amp;nbsp; This means that there isn&#39;t likely to be as much to go around to cover a familly&#39;s budget.
    Deane&#39;s article states that inflation is expected to be at 2%, but expected by whom?&amp;nbsp; In November, 2010 I began to track the cost of food at the retail grocer level via the PracticalDad Price Index, which had a marketbasket cost of $178.39.&amp;nbsp; By January, 2011 the marketbasket cost had risen to $179.38 and by April 1, the price index rose further to a cost of $181.91.&amp;nbsp; On a year&#45;to&#45;date basis of January to April, this is an increase of $2.53, or 1.41%.&amp;nbsp; Annualize this and we&#39;re at a food inflation rate of 5.64%, almost 3 times what&#39;s &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; This is hard data drawn from a survey of three independent and unrelated grocery stores.
    Let&#39;s apply this inflation rate to real&#45;life for the more than 44 million Americans enrolled in the federal SNAP (formerly Food Stamp) program.&amp;nbsp; The average monthly SNAP benefit was $133.79.&amp;nbsp; Since the rate of inflation compounds &#45; it builds upon the previous year &#45; the effect would appear like this.

    The effect of only a 5.64% inflation rate upon the SNAP benefits shows that by the end of five years, the average person would only be able to purchase what can be bought now for about $102, or a full quarter less.&amp;nbsp; Critics can contend that this is a static analysis since SNAP benefits will certainly increase, so &amp;quot;it won&#39;t be so bad...&amp;quot; but consider that the government benefit increases are based upon the Consumer Price Index, which is reported exclusive of food and fuel.&amp;nbsp; Any increases based upon CPI will certainly increase the monthly benefits but at a far lower rate than that of actual food inflation.&amp;nbsp; Consider what&#39;s going through the minds of people who don&#39;t yet qualify for these benefits and have children.
    Inflation is not only a monetary phenomenon but also a psychological one, and fear feeds into that.&amp;nbsp; You can&#39;t fund the necessary and useful projects if everyone is spending their dollars on food and items now for fear of what it will cost a month, week or day in the future.&amp;nbsp; Like the old fable, our society changes from the proverbial ants preparing for the future to the grasshoppers that live in the moment and are reduced to penury for having eaten everything.
    We&#39;re a society that&#39;s been programmed for more than three generations to consume and our economy is now composed of about 70% end&#45;stage consumption spending.&amp;nbsp; Individuals and families will be faced with far harder choices than our grandparents and as spending from flat family incomes shifts back to food, there will be a significant downward effect upon the national economy. And frankly, we have to now push the process of rethinking consumption and in the era of HSN and QVC, that will be no small feat.

So while we&#39;re in good shape relative to a family in Kenya or Mumbai, the problem is that we aren&#39;t in Kenya or Mumbai.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Kids and Taxes</title>
<body>Now that tax day is just past us, the word is out that fully 45% of all Americans don&#39;t pay any taxes and unfortunately, this household isn&#39;t part of that happy minority.&amp;nbsp; I mention this because like other topics, I wonder just how I should characterize it when I mention it to the kids because how we view them is often a microcosm of how we view society and our role in it.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; What Are BRICS and Why Should I Care?</title>
<body>If you hear the financial and economic news, you&#39;ll periodically hear the term BRICS.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t pertain to a building material &#45; although they are trying to build something &#45; and it isn&#39;t something with which to hit &#45; although we&#39;re likely to get whacked.&amp;nbsp; BRICS is an acronym for a five nation consortium, each of which has significantly growing economies as well as a wealth of natural resources, such as people, oil, and gold.&amp;nbsp; These five are Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa and while each is a regional power in its own right, they are now cooperating to further their own interests and create a new monetary system that removes the dollar as the global reserve currency &#45; the linchpin.&amp;nbsp; While the most recent meeting in Hainan, China on April 13 didn&#39;t gain huge press, there are distinct consequences that people should understand and these revolve around the dollar.
Remember that the dollar is both the global reserve currency and a fiat currency.&amp;nbsp; That first means that since the end of the Second World War, all of the world&#39;s international transactions and business have been settled in dollars, even when they&#39;re between two entirely different countries.&amp;nbsp; This has given us a freedom from the kind of worry with which other nations must contend in terms of their currency&#39;s strength and has made international business that much easier.&amp;nbsp; There have been other global reserve currencies throughout history, such as the English Pound and the Roman Denarii and what also tends to accompany a global reserve status is military power.&amp;nbsp; In the other cases, think of the Royal Navy and the Roman Legions.&amp;nbsp;
What a fiat currency means literally is there is nothing backing the currency except for the user&#39;s faith (the latin fiat) that the money has any value.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s neither gold nor silver nor any other natural resource backing the dollar, except perhaps for the American taxpayer.&amp;nbsp; Literally, what gives the dollar value is the belief amongst the rest of the world in that phrase on the buck backed by the full faith and credit.&amp;nbsp; These words have been on the dollar for a long time, certainly longer than we&#39;ve had a $14+ trillion national debt and annual deficits in excess of $1.2 trillion, and because we Americans generally suck at math, the rest of the world has already figured out what we&#39;re now starting to understand:&amp;nbsp; how in the hell do we actually pay this back, &#39;cause God knows we can&#39;t agree on where to cut anything without upsetting somebody.&amp;nbsp;
 What&#39;s now apparent to the world is that the US Federal Reserve plans to handle this nominal debt load by repayment with greatly depreciated dollars and since they&#39;re giving us stuff like oil for what they consider to literally be worthless promises, they&#39;re all starting to look around for the exits so that they&#39;re not left holding a flaming bag of horsepuckey.&amp;nbsp; This is where the BRICS come into play as they are growing national economies with abundant natural resources, whether it&#39;s oil (Russia and now Brazil), gold (China and South Africa), minerals (South Africa, China, Brazil, Russia, India) or people (China and India).&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t want to give away their resources for flaming bags of horsepuckey and they&#39;ve also come to realize that because they collectively hold so many dollars and US Treasury bonds in their foreign exchange reserves, any sudden moves that tank the dollar will literally wipe out their foreign exchange reserves in a heartbeat.&amp;nbsp;
So what to do?&amp;nbsp; Their response, provided last week, is to stop settling their mutual transactions with dollars.&amp;nbsp; If China buys oil from Russia, the transaction will be settled in Rubles and Yuan instead of dollars.&amp;nbsp; When Brazil sends raw materials to China, the transaction will be settled in Reales or Yuan.&amp;nbsp; Because these five nations are going to account for an increasing share of the global economy in the next twenty years &#45; and China is expected to overtake the US as the lead economy in about fifteen years &#45; the defacto effect is to grow their way out and render the dollar meaningless.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s akin to a half&#45;drowned and freezing Kate Winslet telling Leo DeCaprio I love you and I&#39;ll never let you go...as she lets go and he begins his slow descent to sleep with the fishes.&amp;nbsp; As this occurs, expect other nations to begin settling their debt in other currencies until the US is left having to settle debts in other currencies as well; the painful moment will occur when the oil producing nations no longer settle oil transactions in dollars, at which point we&#39;ll truly be in a world of hurt.
Remember that capital is the blood flowing through the global economic body.&amp;nbsp; What doesn&#39;t receive blood withers, and those entities that can&#39;t obtain capital wither likewise.&amp;nbsp; But what scientists have understood for quite some time is that when there&#39;s a blockage that prevents the efficient flow of blood in the body, the body can respond by creating capillaries and routes to bypass the area and deliver the blood.&amp;nbsp; In effect, this plan by the BRICS is precisely that:&amp;nbsp; the creation of new financial capillaries to assure that capital flows to the remainder of the global economic body.
While you can become angry with the nasty furriners for their tricky ways, the reality is that they&#39;re doing what they must to protect themselves from our own foolishness.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve permitted our government to live far, far beyond our means and we&#39;ve sat back while the Federal Reserve System &#45; which is actually owned by the banks and not the government &#45; has been allowed to flood the world with dollars that are increasingly worthless.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, what&#39;s the point of having a signed Babe Ruth card if all that Babe did in his retirement was sign cards like bankers signing foreclosure documents &#45; quickly and in volume?&amp;nbsp; Everybody has one and you might as well clip it to your bicycle spokes.
So what does this mean for us?&amp;nbsp;

    In the next number of years, expect that inflation really does take hold.&amp;nbsp; Oil, and all things oil&#45;related, will rise.&amp;nbsp; Likewise with other products, such as clothing made from cotton, leather products, metals and all the way down the line.&amp;nbsp; This will also be the case for food.
    Don&#39;t look for any serious rises in wages since we&#39;re going to be competing with lower cost labor in these other countries, and there is alot of labor there.
    We have to seriously review how we travel and our mobility.&amp;nbsp; At this moment, we&#39;re paying just below $4/gallon and Europe is paying the equivalent of $9/gallon and even if we get a handle on our use, the cost will rise significantly still.
    As our dollar decreases, and we have to pay higher interest rates to attract lenders, government spending will be so taken up by interest payments that there will be no choice but a significant retrenchment of government spending.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll have to fully redefine the social contract amongst the various interest groups and decide what we can and cannot afford.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of what you think of Paul Ryan, his recent budget plan is a first crack at this nut.
    We&#39;ll have to rethink our consumption based economy model.&amp;nbsp; Do we really need to spend this for something in order to be happy?&amp;nbsp; Is there something besides stuff that gives us meaning?&amp;nbsp;
    We&#39;ll have to reconsider the meaning of the term middle class.&amp;nbsp; I increasingly think that we&#39;ve lost sight of the real meaning of the term and have simplistically equated it with consumption and the ability to consume.
    We&#39;ll have to review our currency and our monetary authority, the Federal Reserve System.&amp;nbsp; Should we place something as crucial as the nation&#39;s monetary policy and supply in the hands of a privately&#45;owned body such as the Fed?&amp;nbsp; (And if you wonder, think about a good part of what&#39;s gotten us here in the first place).

There are a massive number of issues to consider, so many that the body politic is going to truly undergo a shock in the next number of years.&amp;nbsp; The changes will be serious and frequent enough that the American family is going to be buffeted as it hasn&#39;t been since the years of the Great Depression, so hang on and put on your helmet.
The BRICS are going to hurt.</body>

<title>PracticalDad and College:&nbsp; Involving the Parents</title>
<body>Now Marymount sends parents postcards several times a year, invites them to parents&#45;only events and publishes a full&#45;color &amp;quot;Guide for Parents.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; It is one of a growing number of schools to discover that it&#39;s not enough to communicate with prospective students.&amp;nbsp; The colleges are also wooing parents who are digitally tethered to their offspring and want more involvement than writing a tuition check.
&amp;nbsp;&#45; Washington Post:  College Catering to Curious Parents As Well As Prospective Students (April 9, 2011)
Colleges are discovering &amp;quot;that it&#39;s not enough to communicate with prospective students.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; And while there is &amp;quot;digital tethering&amp;quot; involved by some parents, the reality is that many parents are truly concerned about the cost and prospective debtload.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re involved because we&#39;re not stupid.
We&#39;re now fully engaged in the college courtship process as Eldest is wooed by multiple colleges and universities, which range from huge University of Southern Cal and Georgia Tech to tiny Belmont Abbey College.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s gone with her mother to several college open houses and will go to several more as interests and options are explored and I&#39;m honestly surprised to think that the higher learning institutions wouldn&#39;t include significant activities for the parents.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m honestly surprised that this piece of common sense hadn&#39;t occurred to the marketin...er, admissions folks before now.&amp;nbsp; To their credit, the institutions visited thus far have had excellent sessions for students and parents, some both together and separate so not every university has climbed aboard the Crazy Train.&amp;nbsp; The dean of one college honors program endeared himself to my wife when he stated that one of their primary goals was to provide the best education possible without hanging a mortgage around a kid&#39;s neck.
This generation has produced a signficant number of parents who are overly&#45;involved, so much so that the term helicopter parent was coined.&amp;nbsp; We love our kids and perhaps since many grew up in divorced households, have gone too far in the direction of involvement and protection.&amp;nbsp; But parents have something our kids lack in spades, and that&#39;s experience.&amp;nbsp; If a kid has a decent chance of incurring a mortgage sized debt by the age of 23, then he should be shepherded through a visit that&#39;s heavy on fun and light on such questions as faculty/student ratios, facilities, financing and work&#45;study programs.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a local private college nearby that prides itself on a modern student center replete with Mongolian Grill, and if that&#39;s the tripe that&#39;s talked about with the kids, then parents need to be greatly involved.&amp;nbsp; When I first heard about this the other year, my thought was Mongolian Grill?&amp;nbsp; Hell, where are the Mongolians?
Why do we plan to be involved with the college decision?

    Because the cost of higher education has grown at significantly higher rates of inflation than the core CPI monitored by the government and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
    Because the cost of higher education is now significantly more disproportionate to the average family income than it was thirty or forty years ago.
    Because that many more families are now tasked with funding their own retirements than thirty or forty years ago, when our parents and grandparents had pensions.
    Because good jobs for the youngsters are increasingly hard to come by and it&#39;s increasingly less likely that Junior is going to be able to obtain an entry level position that will permit him to service the debt load on non&#45;dischargeable student loans.
    Because we understand that there&#39;s life beyond college and that young adults should have the opportunity to live, travel and enjoy life before settling down to raise children.
    Because we understand that children are expensive and that our grandchildren will be impacted by the money spent on servicing college debt instead of helping provide for them.
    Because one of the first adult decisions facing teenagers is one with huge financial implications, involving factors with which these teens have little experience.

There are two comments from the article that stand out in my mind after reading the article.&amp;nbsp; The first is from a parent:
Even when parents try to hang back, it&#39;s hard not to get involved, said Allen Barnett of Tuxedo Park, NY, who toured American (University) with his 17&#45;year&#45;old son, Cameron, during spring break last month.
Barnett said he tries to keep his opinions to himself as he shows his son college options.&amp;nbsp; But at the end of the search, he said, &amp;quot;you always want to make sure they don&#39;t make a mistake.&amp;quot;
The second is from an &amp;quot;admissions marketing consultant&amp;quot; who stated:
&amp;quot;If I could ban parents from the campus visit, I would.&amp;nbsp; They take the fun out of it...People are still trying to figure out these parents.&amp;quot;
To Mr. Barnett, I would say that he&#39;s not hurting his son or disrespecting his decision&#45;making skills by sharing his opinions.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t constitute something only in the &amp;quot;mistake&amp;quot; category.
And to the admissions marketing consultant, I can only say that I hope you have triplets.

<title>Inflation?&nbsp; Use Your Head&#8230;</title>
<body>One of the memes that&#39;s been gaining credence recently is that the price inflation/deflation argument is close to settled and that inflation is about to reappear in truly significant fashion.  More articles are cropping up and the debate is the reason that I began the PracticalDad Price Index in late 2010, to actually monitor developments on a specified basket of 46 items.&amp;nbsp; But you have to take a moment to think about it and whether certain articles about inflation are truly about inflation or something else entirely.&amp;nbsp; That was the case this morning as I read Zerohedge&#39;s somewhat excited article about major inflation on Costco&#39;s Survivalist Food Cache, which had jumped in price by 47% over a six month period.&amp;nbsp; I like Zerohedge and it&#39;s on my regular reading list, but some might have to stop and think a bit about this particular article.
Yep, the number 47 is correct and I&#39;ve no doubt but that it did rise by that much, also taking into account the stealth inflation of downsizing the package amounts.&amp;nbsp; But there are some things to bear in mind.

    Inflation is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon, usually a response to the supply of currency coursing through the economy at that time.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s why economists follow such money supply data as M1 or the larger, more inclusive M2 with such interest and why the skyrocketing M2 amounts have given inflation proponents real grounds for concern.&amp;nbsp; Other things can cause inflation, such as a supply shock a la the Arab Oil Embargo, but that&#39;s not the issue this time around.
    Watching a market basket of items at three unrelated stores for six months has provided an insight into the early onset and/or the behavior of price.&amp;nbsp; When most go shopping, they&#39;ll typically note that something has gone up in price only if it&#39;s something which they constantly buy and with whose price they&#39;re intimately familiar.&amp;nbsp; More typically, someone will see the price and think I swear that I didn&#39;t pay that much last month, did I? &amp;nbsp;But since almost nobody keeps their receipts and goes back to reference them, there&#39;s typically no positive identification and comments fill the blogosphere with observations and questions of whether something was noticed.&amp;nbsp; Inflation is more akin to having a rodent that runs up and down grocery shelves, peeking its head out so that it&#39;s seen peripherally by the shopper.&amp;nbsp; When checked, the rodent is gone but a dropping is left to confirm its presence and as you step back, you see it pop out again three shelves up and twenty feet away.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t want to shop in that particular store, think of inflation as akin to one of George Norry&#39;s Shadow People, who are typically only noticed peripherally.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t going to happen in such a concentrated instance unless things really are becoming hyperinflationary, or...
    Someone sees a chance to make a bit of a killing.&amp;nbsp; When all of the pricing activity is occurring across a wide variety of generally unrelated food products &#45; and lima beans are really not related to cake mixes &#45; and from one particular business source, then whether the price rise is truly inflationary is questionable.&amp;nbsp; My God, inflation is even hitting the company that packages all of the end of the world as we know it supplies...it must be true.&amp;nbsp; When prices for such a disparate lot of items is rising that much at one clip, then you&#39;ll witness it everywhere and certainly not from one supplier.

I suspect that prices will rise given the sheer volume of money that&#39;s been thrown into the economy over the past two or more years, but there will most likely be a period of creeping inflation before anything such as that hits.&amp;nbsp; Besides, the banks have been the recipients of most of that money and we all know how willing they are to part with it, don&#39;t we?&amp;nbsp; When they decide to let it loose in the larger economy, then we can buckle up for the ride.

<category>Communication</category>
<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Because I Said So&#8230;</title>
<body>In an ideal world, parents and kids should communicate freely.&amp;nbsp; If the child is asked to do something and has legitimate questions as to why, she can ask and Dad has an obligation to explain why.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the ideal world though, and in the real world, this PracticalDad has on more than one occasion simply responded with because I said so. &amp;nbsp;It clearly isn&#39;t the best response and not one that teaches kids the rationale behind why things are &#45; or aren&#39;t&amp;nbsp; &#45; done, such as why it&#39;s not good to clean off the muddy shoes in the bathtub or why a window has to be opened because a bedroom is thoroughly penetrated with Axe body spray.
The real world is different from the ideal that parenting experts and child psychologists hold up for multiple reasons.

    The child, and that includes the teenager, is using the question as a means of postponing the request and if the kid is really lucky, getting Dad so caught up in the response that the request is completely avoided.&amp;nbsp; Talking is easier that actually getting up and doing something.&amp;nbsp; When the question is one that&#39;s been repeated on more than two or three occasions and Dad&#39;s comfortable that the kid isn&#39;t the drooling village idiot, then the response is an entirely appropriate one.
    The child isn&#39;t actually asking, but whining about it.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been more than one occasion when the response is nothing more substantive that because I said so when the question is a reflexively whining why do I have to?&amp;nbsp; And it&#39;s been more than once that PracticalDad&#39;s response to that has been when you can ask and not whine, then I&#39;ll explain it.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, because I said so.&amp;nbsp; Kids have to learn that whining is unacceptable to the request or direction of someone in authority.&amp;nbsp; Make no mistake, the authority in the household can&#39;t reside with the kids.
    PracticalDad is human as well.&amp;nbsp; Things in a busy household have to get done and when someone&#39;s trying to multitask &#45; and it&#39;s not really easy for a guy &#45; then the press of events overtake the ideals of good parenting.&amp;nbsp; This is when it really is important to try to rebound from because I said so, because children are a blank slate and while they&#39;re older now, they won&#39;t learn how to choreograph a schedule or do something if you don&#39;t actually take the time to explain it.&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t mean that conversation won&#39;t become tense, but it does mean that I have to make the effort.
    Related to the first bullet point, the fact that a kid will just repeat why out of&amp;nbsp; stubbornness, even when it&#39;s been answered simply and satisfactorily already.&amp;nbsp; Now it&#39;s a matter of imposing parental authority on the kid.&amp;nbsp; While some believe that parenting shouldn&#39;t be a contest of wills, there are moments when it is and as my father stated on multiple occasions, I&#39;m not losing this argument to a (&amp;amp;*^&amp;amp;*&amp;nbsp; second grader (or third, or fourth, or even ninth).&amp;nbsp; We do learn from our parents and now that I&#39;ve got my own, it&#39;s a stance that I can appreciate.

One of the keys to parenting is to follow&#45;up with the kid and when I&#39;ve hauled the phrase out, I&#39;ve usually tried to have a subsequent conversation when the job is done and the angst is passed.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s uncomfortable and I&#39;ve even occasionally apologized, but more often than not, the result has been that the child does understand so that there isn&#39;t more angst when the request arises again.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Economic Webs</title>
<body>Several days ago, I posted the latest PracticalDad Price Index and apart from coffee&#39;s monthly rise of 4% &#45; for a rise of 30% in six months &#45; what threw me was an 11% rise in Canola Oil, a vegetable oil used for cooking.&amp;nbsp; With this huge rise, Canola Oil took the six month prize for an increase of more than 30%.&amp;nbsp; What I&#39;ve been thinking of since is how something as mundane as canola oil might have repercussions through this economic web that we&#39;ve constructed and how something as distant as Libya&#39;s Gaddhafi now bombing his own oil fields affects the price of bread for Junior&#39;s packed lunch.
First though, just what is canola oil?&amp;nbsp; Read the official Canola Industry literature and you find that it&#39;s derived from the seed of the canola plant, grown principally in Canada.&amp;nbsp; It came into usage in the late 1970s/early 1980s and is generally considered better due to the low amounts of bad fats and high amounts of good fats per serving.&amp;nbsp; It can be purchased in the various sized bottles in the baking/cooking aisle of the grocery store but is also used extensively, along with other forms of oil, in food processing.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case when the food pertains to baked goods such as breads or cake mixes.&amp;nbsp; How widespread?&amp;nbsp; When I searched the pantry and freezer last night, I found that canola oil was used in the loaf of white bread, the frozen loaf of potato bread, the box of baked snacks in the pantry and also the several boxes of various cake mixes.&amp;nbsp; Humans aren&#39;t the only ones eating it, though.&amp;nbsp; The remainder from the processing can be made into seedcake and sold to ranchers to serve as cattle feed, which means that it&#39;s also part of the foodchain in the butcher&#39;s section.&amp;nbsp; Through the six months of the index, flour prices have been stable with only about a 1% rise in the period.
What didn&#39;t occur to me was the extent to which canola is also used as a biofuel source, along with palm oil and our old standby, corn. How much is it used?&amp;nbsp; Well, enough to make a sizable dent in food costs as potential food is redirected to energy needs.&amp;nbsp; As I recall, even George Bush commented that we still needed to keep some corn around for food.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s actually significant statistical relationship between oil price and canola oil, such that when oil prices rise, canola and other vegetable oils rise as well.&amp;nbsp; The long and short is that with oil prices rising as they are &#45; and they are presently tracking to surpass the summer 2008 highs &#45; the biofuel producers will likewise compete with food producers for a finite supply of food, er fuel, whatever.
According to OPEC, there really isn&#39;t much slack in their production so that the loss of oil from some place like Libya can&#39;t be easily offset.&amp;nbsp; So when Colonel Gaddhafi decides to bomb his own oil fields to prevent the Libyan rebels from selling it overseas, that field production is removed from use and places a hit upon the supply line.&amp;nbsp; As users bid for the finite supply, the price increases and as the price increases, people think more and more of biofuels.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s akin to watching Curly smack Moe, who in turn wheels about and smacks Larry in a slapstick routine.&amp;nbsp; But the routine isn&#39;t all that funny as the food producers are in turn passing the increased cost onto us via the grocery stores.&amp;nbsp; So as you try to keep the food spending down by making Junior eat sandwiches in a packed lunch, understand that the impact isn&#39;t coming from the farmers, but instead the seemingly unrelated energy issue.
In this developed economy, we have managed to create a web such that a string plucked outside Benghazi resonates on the supermarket shelf.

<title>Does the HS Student Get A Starter Credit Card?</title>
<body>As Eldest is looking towards senior year in high school, I&#39;ve reflected on some of the personal finance items that I&#39;ve seen other parents do with their kids.&amp;nbsp; Senior year is a good time to do things like open a checking account, but should I also go ahead and help her obtain a credit card (with my wife and I as cosigners)?
I ask because multiple other parents have looked askance at the easy credit available to the lovably gullible/financially stupid college students and decided that they&#39;d help the prospective college students obtain a credit card via co&#45;signing.&amp;nbsp; The thought process is that if the kids have experience with the possession of plastic, then they&#39;ll be less likely to go apeshit when they get one.&amp;nbsp; The other aspect is that they want to help the child begin to earn a solid credit rating; spend a small amount &#45; $20 or $30 &#45; and then pay it off by the due date.&amp;nbsp; The child learns to think in terms of due dates and becomes used to the concept of disciplined spending.
The arguments for it are persuasive.&amp;nbsp; When I was in college three decades ago (?!?!), it was rare to be able to obtain a credit card.&amp;nbsp; It might be possible if you had a cosigner or were a senior with a solid lock on a job, but it was generally less available.&amp;nbsp; By the credit crunch of 2008, the cards were available to college freshmen and it became common for college graduates to leave with both student loans and several thousand dollars in revolving credit debt.&amp;nbsp; Certain lenders preyed &#45; and I use the word purposefully &#45; upon the financial innocence and naivete of youngsters with seemingly free cash.&amp;nbsp; There are some improvements with the Dodd&#45;Frank Act, such as a statement specifying the timeframe and amount ultimately paid if only the minimum due is paid, but the burden of that debt continues with the youngsters.
My thought is this, though.&amp;nbsp; In the new economic model that is approaching &#45; generalized austerity and lower living standards &#45; it&#39;s better for them to learn to live without the panacea of easy credit.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been preaching debt control and savings for years.&amp;nbsp; The older two have heard &#45; are hearing &#45; the need to leave college with as little debt as possible and I&#39;ve been explicit that that carries over to the consumer debt as well.&amp;nbsp; I want them to learn to do without or learn to improvise some other means if they need something, and just giving them a credit card now isn&#39;t liable to instill that.&amp;nbsp; Hell, giving out a cell phone hasn&#39;t led to learning to control the texting, has it?&amp;nbsp;
The question isn&#39;t settled and at some point in the near future, I&#39;ll raise it with my wife and we&#39;ll work it through one way or another.&amp;nbsp; But until then, there will be no cards.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; April 2011 Increases to 101.96 as Coffee Perks Along</title>
<body>We can get the food inflation data from commodities brokers, the Main Stream Media, the CEO of Walmart, or from PracticalDad&#39;s market basket.&amp;nbsp; The April 2011 Price Index is now collected and calculated and the PracticalDad Price Index has risen to 101.96 from March&#39;s figure of 101.19.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the 47 items in the marketbasket have risen 1.97% since the Index inception six months ago.&amp;nbsp; The cost of the April marketbasket was $181.91 versus the March marketbasket cost of 180.52.
Yes, the grains are rising and the coffee is percolating along.
Apart from statistical noise and the occasional price drop &#45; yes, that does happen &#45; what&#39;s notable for the month?

    Grain based products &#45; hot dog rolls and spaghetti noodles &#45; increased 3.5% and 2.5% respectively.&amp;nbsp; This caps off a cumulative six&#45;month price rise of 8.2% (hot dog rolls), 8.9% (white bread) and 9% (spaghetti).
    Coffee rose an additional 4.3% &#45; with no adjustment of package size &#45; to an adjusted cost of $3.87 for a 13 oz can of store brand coffee.&amp;nbsp; Coffee&#39;s cumulative six&#45;month rise is now 30.7% and part of that rise is due to stealth inflation by two retailers who decreased the package size.
    Paper towels rose by 5.9% during the month.
    While most produce was flat, carrots rose 12.7% for a cumulative rise of 18.3% since November.
    Next to the rise in carrots was the 11.7% for Canola Oil, which has now risen by 31% in the six months since November.

Canola oil?&amp;nbsp;
Yes, Canola oil, alias Can(adian) O(il) L(ow) A(cid).&amp;nbsp; This is a cooking oil derived from the dried and processed seed of the canola plant, grown in quantities mostly in Canada, although it&#39;s also grown in Europe and in the US Plains states.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s one of the healthier cooking oils as it&#39;s lower in saturated fat and higher in mono&#45;unsaturated fat than other plant&#45;derived oils.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s now used extensively in processed food production and byproducts of the canola oil production cycle are used by more than a few beef producers as feedcake.
As I&#39;ve looked at the price jumps in the past three months, I&#39;ve also come to find that there&#39;s a high correlation between canola (and other vegetable oils) and heating oil prices because of the increasing use of biofuels to offset higher oil prices.
Practically speaking, this is a great example of watching the rat work through the python.&amp;nbsp; Rises in an input commodity such as canola oil are partially caused by the rise in oil prices, and then work their way through the processed food pricing structure as well input costs for beef producers.&amp;nbsp;
So let&#39;s look at the final April data.

<title>If Inflation Really Takes Off, Should I Max Out The College Debt?</title>
<body>As Eldest is within spitting distance of the college experience, she faces the same issue as hundreds of thousands of other students:&amp;nbsp; how much debt should she take on?&amp;nbsp; And if things are inflationary, shouldn&#39;t she absolutely take the maximum amount of debt possible?
There are certain general rules of economic behavior that pertain to specific situations and that includes living in an inflationary environment.&amp;nbsp; But you have to really think through the circumstances to ascertain if those rules continue to apply to the situation in which you find yourself.&amp;nbsp; One of the precepts of inflation is that a future dollar is worth less than a present dollar because it will only be able to purchase X amount less than could be purchased today.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that inflation truly favors debtors; The debt to be repaid is a nominal amount, say $20,000, and that figure doesn&#39;t take into account whether that nominal $20K can only purchase what $15K could purchase now.&amp;nbsp; The other aspect is that in an inflationary environment, wages are expected to rise as well &#45; even if not at the exact same rate &#45; to offset the price rises.&amp;nbsp; People are paid commensurately more and thus pay off the nominal with devalued currency.
What do you think is the goal of the US Treasury and Federal Reserve System with all of the Quantitative Easing?&amp;nbsp; Do you really believe that the United States can pay off a $14+ Trillion national debt?&amp;nbsp; Spur inflation, spur spending and hope &#45; pray &#45; that the executive and legislative branches get a handle on the spending to stop the flow into the debt bucket while the dollar is trashed.
I guarantee you that somewhere out there, some expert will recommend that with an inflationary environment, prospective students and their families should take the leap and incur the maximum amount of debt to pay for college.&amp;nbsp; The thinking will be that the competitive edge is so keen that a college degree will be painted as the sole hope of making way in the world and that it&#39;s the obligation of families to support their youngsters &#45; and the youngsters make a significant investment in themselves &#45; and spend whatever&#39;s necessary to obtain that degree.&amp;nbsp; It would be a great time to take on the debt since it could be paid off in devalued dollars; this would be &#45; per experts &#45; a true value play for the upcoming generation.&amp;nbsp; Were this to be suggested as expert advice, I have no doubt that some would go ahead and run up the debt even more.
But does that thinking really hold water in these circumstances?
No, and here&#39;s why.&amp;nbsp; First, the presumption is that wages would naturally rise following an inflationary surge.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that our real wages and incomes have actually dropped in the past number of years as our high&#45;value jobs have been increasingly outsourced to countries with significantly lower labor costs.&amp;nbsp; As these changes happen, the aggregate effect is that less and less true productive wealth is supporting the wages earned via the service industries with a resulting loss of aggregate income.&amp;nbsp; One of the problems that American businesses are facing now is that the American consumer is so wage hamstrung and debt&#45;laden that they&#39;re unable to effectively pass along many price increases that they&#39;re having to absorb from their own suppliers.&amp;nbsp; There is simply nothing to demonstrate &#45; absent a wholesale mass&#45;mailing of stimulus checks to consumers &#45; that wages will simply, suddenly turn around and begin rising.
Second, consider the present nature of the student debt.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;ll be greater push for incurring increased debt but is there going to be a concurrent change in the student loan model to ease the burden of that increased debt?&amp;nbsp; Student debt, as I&#39;ve written before, is far more toxic than any other debt since it can never be discharged in bankruptcy should things really go south for that particular student.&amp;nbsp; He or she can take the credit hit in exchange for erasure of mortgage and credit card debt, auto loans, and whatever else.&amp;nbsp; But the student debt will have to be repaid, even at the cost of that individual&#39;s future.&amp;nbsp; Consider this:&amp;nbsp; Sallie Mae, the principal student lender, is a privatised GSE &#45; just like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &#45; and exists solely to serve the student debt market.&amp;nbsp; As of last year, student debt surpassed consumer credit and was second only to home loans in dollar terms.&amp;nbsp; Sallie Mae is aware of this and while they spent $3.4 million on lobbying in 2008, they revved the lobbying engines and spent more than half as much &#45; $1.86 million &#45; in the first quarter of 2010 alone.&amp;nbsp; This rise occurred as the Federal government considered legislation that would remove privatised student lending and the rise in lobbying to prevent shows where Sallie Mae places her emphasis.
Third, what if the dollar really does tank and hyperinflation ruins the currency?&amp;nbsp; In that unlikely event, a $120K student debt could conceivably be repaid by three days wages.&amp;nbsp; But food and other essentials would be equally expensive and lay claim to those three days wages.&amp;nbsp; Gee, do I eat and house and feed the kids or pay my student loan? &amp;nbsp;The contract however, would still remain in effect and I fully expect that once things stabilized &#45; in whatever form &#45; that the lenders would still demand repayment of their debts in the new dollar equivalent.&amp;nbsp; The currency is ruined, but the contract is not, and again, the law would still stipulate that student debt was non&#45;dischargeable.&amp;nbsp;
The reality is that we, the individuals, presently exist to serve the needs of the corporations and by extension, their shareholders and management.&amp;nbsp; There is simply too much wealth and power at stake for these few to readily accede to the common good and change in such a way that diminishes that wealth and power.&amp;nbsp;
Will these things actually come to pass?&amp;nbsp; I hope not.&amp;nbsp; But if they should, expect that experts will begin plying the airwaves and internet with advice about the relationship between inflation and debt.&amp;nbsp; And when you hear them, ask them whether the other aspects of debt have changed in any material way as to repayment, terms or forgiveness.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, chalk it up as more self&#45;serving white noise.</body>

<title>Parenthood:&nbsp; When The Trees Thin Out</title>
<body>Being a parent &#45; I hate the word parenting &#45; is an experience of not being to see the forest for the trees.&amp;nbsp; When the kids are old enough to enter activities, you want them to try their hands at new things and experiences.&amp;nbsp; Couple that with more than one child and toss in homework and friends and life becomes a blur.&amp;nbsp; Who has to be where and at what time?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the deadline on this project or that exam and again, would you please explain to me how we came to have three girls spending the night in the basement?&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re running at high speeds in a forest and while you might get smacked by the branches of the occasional foulup, you work hard to avoid running into a trunk that could drop you flat on your back.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a breathless experience in the moment and more than a little nervewracking.
But there are moments when you can step back and take stock and when you do, you recognize that the forest is beginning to thin out.&amp;nbsp; There are still plenty of trees to dodge but there are more spots of dappled sunlight on the ground and an instant more breathing room before you have to swerve to the left or right to avoid the next trunk.&amp;nbsp; This occurred to me this evening as I waited for Youngest at his baseball practice, an event far enough from the house that it makes no sense to just drop him off and return later.&amp;nbsp; Middle had a night off from any activity and Eldest had gotten a ride to soccer from a friend.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s the norm for overlapping activities, Eldest takes her driver&#39;s test next week and will be able to start driving herself, freeing me from having to worry about how to get her there or home.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll still worry about her driving, but that&#39;s suddenly a bit of relief from the taxi&#45;servicing.&amp;nbsp; To bring the point home more emphatically, she also commences on the college open&#45;house tour with her mother next week and in a year, the forest around me will be thinned by all that much more.
I spoke last week with a gentleman who&#39;s firm has done multiple home projects for us over the years.&amp;nbsp; He has three sons of his own and the youngest is a lacrosse player in his junior year of college and as we chatted, he commented that he and his wife now treasure each of those games.&amp;nbsp; He recognizes that there are only a relative handful left over the next two seasons and then, that aspect of his life will have ended after roughly two decades of practices, games and tournaments.&amp;nbsp; His forest is now an open grove and ahead of him is open field, free of the obstacles that cause us to react more than act.&amp;nbsp; At a rural baseball field surrounded by copses of trees and pastures, his commentary plucked a particularly melancholy chord in my soul.&amp;nbsp; The tone resonated and on reflection, I decided that as this multiple&#45;sport season progresses, I&#39;ll have a greater appreciation for the beauty of this forest in which I find myself.

<title>A Preview:&nbsp; English Household Incomes Falling</title>
<body>Even before the credit collapse and financial crisis of 2008, I&#39;ve expected that the long&#45;term economic health of the American family would suffer.&amp;nbsp; Lousy economic investment &#45; houses, anyone? &#45; and the insanely short&#45;sighted habit of shipping higher&#45;value American jobs overseas so that the manufacturing base is &amp;quot;hollowed out&amp;quot; were key drivers in the premise.&amp;nbsp; When Congress passed TARP in 2008 and the Federal Reserve commenced with its initial round of Quantitative Easing, it was apparent that the government would address the long&#45;term debt issue by trying to devalue the dollar via inflation instead of actually working to manage the budget.&amp;nbsp; The logic was inescapable but the only question was the timeframe.&amp;nbsp;
Now we&#39;ve got a glimpse of what&#39;s coming as data confirms that English household income has fallen since 2008.&amp;nbsp; As discouraging as things appear to be in the US, you can take a little comfort in knowing that England&#39;s economy is even more screwed up and the personal level wave is hitting there before it really begins to commence here.&amp;nbsp; The Bank of England has likewise been acting to devalue the English currency and that is now taking off as the most recently reported English inflation rate is about 4.4% per year, ahead of the American inflation rate, which unfortunately is hard to gauge since the government doesn&#39;t consider food or fuel as part of the core CPI.&amp;nbsp;
The English incomes have been struck from two primary sides.&amp;nbsp; First, the increasing inflation rate means that &#45; absent offsetting nominal wage gains &#45; the English Pound will be able to purchase that much less than before.&amp;nbsp; Second, the exceptionally low interest rates mean that the money being saved is actually losing value and so eliminating the entire notion of savings.&amp;nbsp; If you lose money by saving, why save for the future?&amp;nbsp; A lesser factor for the English is simply that there economy has an even smaller manufacturing base than we do, so what they can produce that the world will want is minimal.&amp;nbsp;
Here&#39;s the problem &#45; for them and for us &#45; as we move forward.&amp;nbsp; As rates remain low and so discourage savings, and price increases really do take hold, then people will develop an inflationary mindset.&amp;nbsp; The effect of such thinking is an unwillingness to save or plan for the future as people spend themselves into financial destitution.&amp;nbsp; As Aesop would describe it, the grasshoppers will overwhelm the ants and devour everything so that nothing is left for the future.&amp;nbsp; The long&#45;term impact for the country of such a mindset is, to put it mildly, horrible.

<title>Battle Hymn of the PracticalDad</title>
<body>The press lit up in January with the publication of Amy Chua&#39;s Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, her account of choosing to raise her Chinese&#45;American daughters in the style of the prototypical Chinese mother&#39;s &amp;quot;take no prisoners&amp;quot; philosophy.&amp;nbsp; And as events and circumstances change concurrently, I&#39;ve had to consider the strengths and weaknesses of that approach.
There&#39;s an image of a successful Asian student in almost all of our schools, and behind that image is another &#45; a demanding and exacting mother.&amp;nbsp; A woman who won&#39;t tolerate failure and seemingly sacrifices a personal relationship with her child in order to obtain a child who succeeds but will presumably run for the hills when older and out of the household.&amp;nbsp; Contrast this with the American approach in which parents want the kids to largely try different things and be happy, not to mention be the kids&#39; friends as well.&amp;nbsp; Some Americans have taken this book as a bit of an affront and defended their parenting style and truth be told, there&#39;s value to both sides.&amp;nbsp;
But first consider the rationale behind the Chinese approach.&amp;nbsp; Recognize that the Chinese mothers &#45; like all mothers &#45; want what&#39;s best for their kids and want them to have a better life.&amp;nbsp; So far, the two groups are matched.&amp;nbsp; But then recognize the circumstances behind the approach.&amp;nbsp; The Chinese society was family&#45;centric and generations could live in the same area without moving a significant distance.&amp;nbsp; And while America as a nation is only 235 years old, Chinese society for at least that long was fractured and trapped in decline after their historic eras, only resurgent in the past several decades.&amp;nbsp; If Chinese parents &#45; like their counterparts almost everywhere &#45; wanted their children to have a better life than theirs and there were only so many opportunities available, then these children would have to truly excel in some manner to avail themselves of those opportunities.&amp;nbsp; The kids would have to know how to apply themselves &#45; and Chua&#39;s absolutely correct when she states that it isn&#39;t something that comes naturally for most children &#45; and also be able to handle pressure.&amp;nbsp; They would have to understand that the family was the core bedrock of their existence as so much of then&#45;Chinese society wasn&#39;t stable, either politically or economically, and it was the young adults who would be coping with the pressure of both raising children and helping care for elderly parents.
The opposing view is the Western/American mother.&amp;nbsp; Given the freedoms that we&#39;ve enjoyed, and the historic economic/social mobility that went with it, there&#39;s a greater sense that the kids will have opportunities.&amp;nbsp; The long&#45;time generational view has been that the next rising generation would be better off than its predecessors.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, this country is now at least three generations removed from the last great and serious trials of the Great Depression and Second World War and it&#39;s only been in the last number of years that parents and adults have begun to honestly question whether that same promise exists.&amp;nbsp; American adults have also enjoyed a greater mobility than their Chinese counterparts and it&#39;s not at uncommon to have elderly parents in one region while the adult children are in an entirely different timezone.&amp;nbsp; If the parents were no longer capable of caring for themselves, there were other options available apart from living with the children.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve simply enjoyed so much prosperity and relative ease compared with the remainder of the world that we&#39;ve been able to spend greater time on leisure and introspection than our peers elsewhere on the planet and the presumption still exists that the paradigm will hold.
This PracticalDad has generally followed the western approach to parenting, albeit with stricter guidelines.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been clear with them that they shouldn&#39;t try to grow up too fast like their peers since they can only have one childhood.&amp;nbsp; There are plenty of adults trying to recapture their youth and they frankly look like a bunch of damned fools doing so.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s a greater appreciation for the Chinese approach over the past several years as our economy has undergone significant and worrisome changes.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that the kids will have to be able to compete globally and if they don&#39;t have an appreciation for hard work and discipline, then they&#39;re going to have their lunch eaten for them.&amp;nbsp; So there is greater expectation of academic performance than with other families, and a greater amount of time spent discussing the realities of our world with them. Neither my wife nor I are looking to raise self&#45;actualized adults &#45; whatever that means &#45; but adults capable of surviving in a more unfriendly world and doing so in a moral, ethical manner.
Which might be the toughest hurdle of all.
So we&#39;ll continue to try providing them with opportunities that are fun and help children grow, but maintain expectations that force them to reach beyond themselves.&amp;nbsp; Because the world is going to require that they be able to reach beyond themselves far more than we&#39;ve had to.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; What If Pennsylvania Cuts Higher Education Funding By 50%?</title>
<body>I was stunned to find last week that the new Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Corbett (R), planned to cut funding to higher education by fully 50% as he attempts to honor his campaign promise of eliminating a $4 Billion deficit without raising any taxes.  The backdraft has been significant and I know folks at a local state university who have been told to prepare for the worst.  But apart from the sheer magnitude of the cut, what might it mean for the young people and their families?&amp;nbsp; It helps to consider other numbers in order to gain a better perspective on the issue, so let&#39;s examine things a bit further.
First, consider the higher education budget in perspective.&amp;nbsp; In the previous year, the higher education piece was about $1.3 Billion, or 4.5% of the entire state budget of $29 Billion.&amp;nbsp; But the amount removed actually constitutes 16.5% of the $4 Billion deficit that&#39;s being eliminated; this is disproportionate by a factor of more than 3 times the original contribution.&amp;nbsp; This cut is across all of the institutions in the state system, PASSHE (Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education) which includes not only the flagship Penn State University, but also 14 smaller universities as well as 4 quasi&#45;private universities such of Pitt and Temple.&amp;nbsp; The amount of the state&#39;s contribution to higher education has decreased over the past decade or more and will finally fall to a level not seen since the formation of PASSHE in the early 1980s.&amp;nbsp;
Second, consider the effect upon individual institutions themselves.&amp;nbsp; Everybody&#39;s first thought upon announcement was to determine what Penn State&#39;s leadership would say, but PSU only receives about 8% of its funding via state appropriations.&amp;nbsp; The smaller 14 universities actually receive around 30% of their funding from the state and it&#39;s here that the pain will occur, especially since many of these are either operating with an already existent deficit or have only kept up with the already declining funding by eliminating faculty positions and / or programs and upgrades.&amp;nbsp; For a case in point, examine some &amp;quot;back of the envelope&amp;quot; calculations on two state universities, Millersville University (MU) and Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP).&amp;nbsp; Given the already strained financial positions and the reality that much spending is already constrained by contracts that won&#39;t be completed by the time that the budget passes, it&#39;s a fair assumption that much of the funding cuts will be made up on the backs of the students.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

            15100
            1721



&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The effect would be a single year rise of 12.8% for those at Millersville University and 10.5% for the students at IUP.&amp;nbsp; While the percentages &#45; back of the envelope as they are &#45; aren&#39;t as dire as California&#39;s 33% increase in 2009, they are a staggering blow to students and their families.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that even more students will extend the time that it takes to obtain a degree and the reality is that the longer it takes, the less likely to obtain it.
Budget cuts have to happen and most understand that simple concept.&amp;nbsp; We have an obligation to care for those less or unable to care for themselves, as we always have.&amp;nbsp; But we also have an obligation to prepare for our future and a large part of that is creating both a citizenry and workforce that can function, compete and prosper against others in the coming years.&amp;nbsp; We can&#39;t talk about competing with other states, let alone countries, when we fail to provide reasonably priced education for our young people and the ultimate result will be a more poorly educated and less competitive populace.&amp;nbsp; And a smaller one as they move away to find the financially self&#45;supporting jobs that accrue to regions and states that help prepare their people for the world.

<title>PracticalDad and College:&nbsp; Austerity Comes Home</title>
<body>While sides are drawn in the Wisconsin public union fight, everyone agrees that the country and its constituent states are trapped in a case of too many promises, too little cash.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s playing out now in Wisconsin &#45; and coming soon to Illinois, California and almost every state &#45; is simply the first stage in the fight of redefining our spending priorities.&amp;nbsp; We just can&#39;t have it all and something has to give.&amp;nbsp; The local papers over the past several days have brought this to my doorstep as the news announces that our new governor, Tom Corbett, will eliminate the $4 billion deficit via spending cuts alone.&amp;nbsp; The kicker here is that under his plan, state universities will lose fully 50% of their funding.&amp;nbsp;
That&#39;s fully one half of their state funding.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t mean that the university system budgets are going to be lopped by one half, especially since the majority of the university monies don&#39;t come from the state treasury.&amp;nbsp; In fact, the amount that Penn State University, the flagship institution, receives from Pennsylvania amounts to only about 8% of its total budget; while I can&#39;t find how much a smaller institution gets from the state, it is probably in that ballpark range.&amp;nbsp; On the opposition side, the universities are arguing that that money is specifically used to subsidize tuition for in&#45;state students so that what a Pennsylvanian pays is less than someone from New York or Delaware, hence the students will be the ones in front of the falling axe.&amp;nbsp; One opponent, from the faculty union, stated that tuition could rise by a full 33% should this play out.&amp;nbsp; While it sounds outrageous, the reality is that California raised tuition by 32% in one fell swoop so it isn&#39;t impossible.&amp;nbsp; The likelihood is that truth and reason will take a back seat to the soundbites and the fallout will be somewhere far less than that, although it will increase.
Also on my doorstep is Eldest, who&#39;s visiting two of these schools in the next month.&amp;nbsp; Our mantra has been education without the debt, or as little debt as possible.&amp;nbsp; We view student debt with almost the same abhorrence as a childhood cancer, something that &#45; even with survival &#45; will follow these young people for years, having an impact on their ability to live a decent, sustainable life years after the debt&#39;s been incurred.&amp;nbsp; Like most, we&#39;ve saved some but not enough and already, prospective colleges have been given the axe because of cost.&amp;nbsp; The University of Southern California sounds lovely, but not on the dime that they demand.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, other top institutions.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll have to revisit plans again and review the prospects and somehow, we&#39;ll find a way to make it work.
But here&#39;s my problem with the proposal and it&#39;s a problem with both sides.&amp;nbsp; First, if we&#39;re going to talk about the necessity for a better educated citizen to compete globally, then we can&#39;t place such a radical cut upon the age group that&#39;s expected to compete globally for business and trade, a group that&#39;s young, inexperienced and realistically has no political voice.&amp;nbsp; The flip side is that the entrenched higher education leaders have no business immediately holding these young people hostage with threats of a one&#45;third tuition increase.&amp;nbsp; If a major institution is going to see it&#39;s funding move from 8% to 4% from one source, how does that translate into a one&#45;third increase?&amp;nbsp; Explain to me, please, without the angst and hyperbole, understanding that I live in a college town and see capital spending that&#39;s best described as unnecessary.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t talk about different accounts and different pots of money, because I&#39;ve worked in the corporate world and understand that these things can be changed and adapted to the new circumstances.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not easy, but it is achievable
We&#39;ll adapt and figure out a way to make it work, but only if both sides recall that not only are they tossing the newest generation of workers into the firing line, they&#39;re tossing in our children as well.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Comments On Pricing Food</title>
<body>It&#39;s been five months since I began to track prices on a specific marketbasket of items, and even longer since we began to hear about the return of inflation.&amp;nbsp; There are some things that I&#39;ve noted since the process began, including some thoughts while on my hands and knees checking the unit prices on the bottom shelve of the stores.

    Listening to commentators and bloggers &#45; whether you agree with their views or not &#45; you suspect that the onset of inflation will occur like a financial tsunami that washes our collective savings out to sea.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that the onset of inflation is considerably more insidious and if you aren&#39;t paying attention, then you might not be able to verify that it&#39;s happening.&amp;nbsp; Wait, didn&#39;t I pay less last month for this?&amp;nbsp; I think so, but there&#39;s no receipt to check. &amp;nbsp;When the individual items are shown with prices over time, then you can see that some items do increase over time while others are motionless and still others wander over the margins like a drunken sailor.&amp;nbsp;
    You begin to see how individual grocery stores and retail chains are managing with what they&#39;re presented.&amp;nbsp; In one instance &#45; formula &#45; I started with the same product at all three stores but after a price spurt at one store, that particular management apparently decided that the product was too expensive to stock for their customers and removed it from the shelves.&amp;nbsp; I consequently now price that formula at only two stores instead of the original three.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, grocery chains quietly downsize the product packaging before they move forward and actually rise the prices; coffee is a case in point as two of the three stores downsized the product and it was only in March that a significant price hike was passed through to the consumer.
    Pricing decisions also reflect the actions of the purchasing managers who might somehow get a better deal for that particular month so that the price of the item has actually dropped.&amp;nbsp; There have been multiple occasions when I&#39;ve revisited a store two or even three times to verify that I didn&#39;t foul up and write the wrong data.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t to say that there haven&#39;t been mistakes, but simply that the motion isn&#39;&#39;t always upwards.
    How can I describe the sense from pricing explicit items over time and watching their activity?&amp;nbsp; Honestly, it&#39;s struck me as though I&#39;m on a beach and aware that the tide is going to come in.&amp;nbsp; I maintain a position, but to help my sense, place sticks at specific positions in the sand to both my left and my right.&amp;nbsp; As I observe, I can see that as a wave washes ashore, one marker will be overrun while its neighbors remain dry.&amp;nbsp; This continues with the immediate waves never quite washing up in the same place but over the course of time, individual sticks are increasingly overwhelmed by water while others might remain less underwater, a function of whatever factor I can&#39;t know.&amp;nbsp; And if you aren&#39;t paying attention because you&#39;re playing with the kids, you suddenly realize that the waves are approaching the towels and scramble to keep things from ruination.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s happened but you can&#39;t really say how or when.
    What economists &#45; and bloggers &#45; will say is that inflation is not only a monetary phenomenon, but also a psychological one as well.&amp;nbsp; The effect of the psychology is to change the behavior to account for the situation at hand and the case study for this was the Weimar Hyperinflation of post First World War Germany, when the middle class was left destitute.&amp;nbsp; Why save when what you get is going to be worth nothing in the next week or even day?&amp;nbsp; That isn&#39;t to say that this is what will occur because honestly,&amp;nbsp; no one can be certain.&amp;nbsp; But the across&#45;the&#45;board increases that people expect will create that kind of psychology, even if it&#39;s &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; 10 or 15% annually.

The PracticalDad Price Index will continue and I plan to pass the data along to someone who has a better sense of how it might be analyzed.&amp;nbsp; The kinks have been largely worked out by now and this can serve as a small indicator of what&#39;s happening to us as we live our lives.

<title>Kids and Public Behavior</title>
<body>I&#39;m big on teaching the kids how to behave in public.&amp;nbsp; How do you behave at the ballgame versus at a restaurant versus a wedding or funeral?&amp;nbsp; But there are moments when I have to remind myself that I have to be as mindful of my own behavior as the kids&#39;.&amp;nbsp; This was especially brought home to me this weekend as I watched a proud father make a complete ass of himself at a school function.
Supporting the kids is as obvious as breathing, but how it&#39;s done gets dicier as the kids age.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a wonderful television commercial in which a child &#45; one time on stage, another on a playing field &#45; looks into the crowd of onlookers and suddenly, the crowd vanishes save for the father, who&#39;s now the only one watching.&amp;nbsp; The underlying truism is that the kids both want and need us there and are seeking our approval and pride in their accomplishments.&amp;nbsp;
Now, let&#39;s adjust the commercial for the age of the child.&amp;nbsp; In this variant, the kid is now fourteen years of age and as he looks onto the field, there in the crowd is the father.&amp;nbsp; Dad smiles and nods &#45; as in the real commercial &#45; but the crowd remains.&amp;nbsp; The next version of the commercial shows the fourteen year old on the field looking at the crowd as his proud papa suddenly stands and screams out YOU GO, BOY!&amp;nbsp; MAKE ME PROUD!&amp;nbsp; WOOT!!!&amp;nbsp; In this version, the crowd remains while the exuberant Dad vanishes without a trace.&amp;nbsp;
In the version that I witnessed this weekend, the teen was walking down the auditorium aisle to accept an award when Dad suddenly stood and yelled out her name amidst the silent crowd sitting there.&amp;nbsp; Note that the applause had already finished so it wasn&#39;t as if the child received no applause.&amp;nbsp; Sitting next to my sons, I flinched and looked over to see the eldest visibly wince as well.&amp;nbsp; Were that me, I doubt that I would have made it home alive as body parts would have been tossed piecemeal from the speeding car windows as it swerved down the road.
Kids do become more sensitive of public appearances as they age and there are times when even the presence of a parent can cause embarrassment.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t mind him, he always breathes that way. &amp;nbsp;Our presence is a reminder that they really haven&#39;t reached adulthood and aren&#39;t as independent as they think or would like, and acting in a way that publicly draws that to the fore does embarrass them.&amp;nbsp; I understand that father&#39;s pride and am glad that he&#39;s had the opportunity to experience it.&amp;nbsp; But the ride home would have been much better had he kept his mouth shut and stayed seated.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; March Rises to 101.19</title>
<body>With the store pricing done and data tabulated, the PracticalDad Price Index rose in March, 2011 to 101.19 from a February figure of 100.78.&amp;nbsp; This is a cumulative 1.19% increase over the November, 2010 rate of 100.&amp;nbsp; While the market basket has shown only minor upwards movement, there are certain items that stand out.

    The price per one pound of ground beef has been at $3.32, which is 10% higher than the original November, 2010 price of $3.02/lb.
    Coffee rose &#45; without any adjustment in the package size &#45; by 9.7% from the February price (from $3.38 to $3.71) and since the Index&#39;s inception by a full 25%.&amp;nbsp; This 25% rise incorporates adjustment for two different stores of unrelated chains decreasing the package size while keeping the price steady, aka stealth inflation.
    While the price of flour itself has remained steady at $1.99 per five pound bag, the cost of baked goods &#45; bread and hot dog rolls &#45; has begun to rise.&amp;nbsp; Bread rose by 8.9% last month while the rolls have increased by 4.5% since the Index&#39;s inception.
    Milk (2%) jumped by almost 5% from February, which was actually lower than the November price, having declined.
    Canola Oil rose by more than 12% from the February price and is now 17% higher than at the Index&#39;s inception.

Here are the prices for the marketbasket.

<title>Making Sense of the Child:&nbsp; Getting Inside the Head</title>
<body>It can be difficult to follow a child&#39;s thought process.&amp;nbsp; The logic is jumbled and the thinking cluttered with misconceptions and misinformation and following the conversation with a kid is akin to trying to track a rabbit that suddenly disappears down a hole, only to reappear fifteen minutes later from another hole linked to its den.&amp;nbsp; But there is a logic there and it&#39;s helpful to make an effort to understand it, especially when it dictates actions and attitudes that are contrary to what we teach and try to model ourselves.&amp;nbsp; Such is the case with Youngest and his desire to lose this year&#39;s Pinewood Derby.
If you aren&#39;t aware, the Pinewood is a coming of age experience for millions of boys who&#39;ve gone through cub scouts, in which they turn a Pine block, four nails and wheels into a racing creation.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s also where a father&#39;s own attitudes come into play as to how to help the boy with the car.&amp;nbsp; My own attitude is that it&#39;s ultimately the boy&#39;s car.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll help him to clarify his drawings and in the early years, cut the car for him, but it&#39;s otherwise up to his own imagination and desire to produce.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a function of my understanding of the purpose of Pinewood as well as my own awareness of my handiness with tools &#45; I can do basics, but I&#39;m not a craftsman.&amp;nbsp; Both of my sons have produced solidly middle&#45;of&#45;the&#45;pack vehicles that will win a few heats but never take an entire derby.
After last year&#39;s race, he was curious about why a particularly cool looking car was so slow as to consistently lose, so convincingly that it won the Most Fuel Efficient trophy, a consolation trophy awarded to assauge the embarrassment of the boy who builds that year&#39;s slowest car.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s awarded for the slowest car, it&#39;s a legitimately nice award that doesn&#39;t mock the effort.&amp;nbsp; All of the trophies are Hot Wheels cars and professionally engraved plaques mounted on varnished wood bases and in this year&#39;s case, was a Hot Wheels modified 1971 Maverick; it isn&#39;t a milk or garbage truck.&amp;nbsp; Over the intervening year, we&#39;d have occasional conversations about Pinewood and it became apparent that not only did he not want to win, but he wanted to lose and do so consistently.&amp;nbsp; He didn&#39;t want a sleek vehicle, but an absolute clunker that was the slowest thing on the track.&amp;nbsp; While my wife and I aren&#39;t sticklers about having to win &#45; do your best and try, but bear losing with some grace &#45; this was frankly disconcerting.&amp;nbsp; When it came time to start this year&#39;s Pinewood car, it sank in that he was actively incorporating design elements that were in last year&#39;s slowest car.&amp;nbsp; As we talked further, his thought process clarified into something that was surprisingly mature and honestly, very goal&#45;oriented.&amp;nbsp; But the goal wasn&#39;t to win, it was to obtain a trophy.&amp;nbsp; He defined success in a much different way than I did.
You see, I make the trophies, which are cheaper than the good&#45;looking statues and more attractive than the cheesy awards.
Youngest saw the trophies and realized that the Most Fuel Efficient was frankly as attractive as the others, albeit with a smaller scale car.&amp;nbsp; He wanted a trophy and measured his capabilities versus those of other boys who were either more gifted with their hands or had far more hands&#45;on fathers and decided that in order to achieve his goal, his best shot of earning that trophy was to build a complete loser.&amp;nbsp; To his credit, he actively built his car to lose and when it came time to add white graphite to the axles, which effectively decreases friction on the nail&#45;axles, he declined as he knew that everybody else wanted the graphite added.
Precisely how do I handle a situation in which a child defines success in losing?&amp;nbsp; Children are concrete and the abstract doesn&#39;t come until much later, so the motivation is in a tangible, three dimensional award instead of an&amp;nbsp; ephemeral sense of victory.&amp;nbsp; Youngest determined his goal and then worked to achieve that goal.&amp;nbsp; Do I demand that he abandon that goal and come away with nothing or do I go ahead and support the kid when he&#39;s actually using his head and thinking through the situation?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s one of the most surreal scenarios that I&#39;ve encountered in sixteen years of fatherhood.
He came in dead last of four cars in his first heat and when he raised his arms and cheered, parents looked askance.&amp;nbsp; When he came in last again and celebrated, a few looked at me and I explained and as the morning wore on, a few parents &#45; me included &#45; also began to cheer when his car lost.&amp;nbsp; When all was said and done, he ultimately failed at his attempt to fail and as a measure of its surrealism, I don&#39;t know whether he say that he actually failed or succeeded.&amp;nbsp; I can say that I&#39;m honestly proud of him in his clear assessment of himself and his chances as well as his design that furthered his chance of meeting his goal.&amp;nbsp; The issue sometimes isn&#39;t the child himself, but rather the circumstances in which the child finds himself and finding that that&#39;s the case can save considerable heartache and grief.
As a final note, we&#39;ll be having a conversation amongst the pack leadership about the lesson taught in such a visible reward of failure.

<body>The budgetary chickens are coming home to roost as newspapers run stories about school districts having to cut back significantly to meet the financial shortfalls.&amp;nbsp; With no money forthcoming from the states since they&#39;re broke as well, all manner of things are on the block to bring the budget into balance.&amp;nbsp; While some can talk about reinstituting programs later when the money is available, the simple reality is that we&#39;re resetting to a new and lower norm of spending.&amp;nbsp; There simply isn&#39;t the money to cover all of the promises made and obligations taken on.&amp;nbsp; So what can I do for my kids in what&#39;s sure to be a tighter, more competitive educational environment?
I can kick their ass.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>What Does Food Inflation Really Mean?</title>
<body>Everybody talks about incipient inflation and what it really means, and the most recent data from China &#45; suspect that it is &#45; indicates that the consumer prices there rose&amp;nbsp; 4.9% year over year from January of 2010.&amp;nbsp; When I mention suspect, bear in mind that they rejiggered their marketbasket and had it been left alone, the rise would have been 5.1%.&amp;nbsp; So what does it mean to the typical family when they see increasing inflation hitting the grocery stores?&amp;nbsp; Percentages can be scary, but what&#39;s the real impact?
Let&#39;s play with the use the Chinese rate of 4.9% and extrapolate it with some American data.&amp;nbsp;
First, remember that inflation means that there&#39;s a decline in the buying power of the currency so that with the same amount of money, you&#39;re able to purchase less than you could before.&amp;nbsp; If the inflation rate from one year to the next is 4.9%, then the same amount at the later date is 4.9% higher; the inverse is that if you maintain the amount spent as a constant, then you&#39;re only able to purchase that much less.
Let&#39;s work through the numbers.&amp;nbsp; According to Bureau of Labor Statistics courtesy of creditloan.com, the average American &amp;quot;consumer unit&amp;quot; of 2.5 people spent $3753 annually in 2009 for food at home for a monthly average of $312.&amp;nbsp; Bear in mind that when dining out was included, the total annual amount on food rose to $6372.&amp;nbsp; For our purposes, we&#39;ll use the $312 as a baseline while understanding that if you&#39;ve got kids, you&#39;re spending more per month than this example bears out.

            .787
            312.00
            245.54



&amp;nbsp;Assuming all else remains the same, the impact upon the food budget is significant as a $312 monthly budget only purchases what you can buy now for $245.&amp;nbsp;
The other problem is that income is at best, flat and for the lower wage groups, actually dropping.&amp;nbsp; According to the BLS at the same site, the average pretax income of that odd 2.5 average consumer unit declined from $63,091 in 2008 to $62,857 in 2009.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, inflation is a nebulous and inexact thing and to think that it only happens in an orderly and predictable manner is like saying that you can capture a specific number of insects with a single swoop of the butterfly net.
So where do we begin to cut?&amp;nbsp; The first source is most likely the amount that&#39;s spent on dining out, which was about $218/month for the consumer unit.&amp;nbsp; And after that comes a rejiggering of the family menu as brand names go by the wayside in favor or store brands and then a shift in the menu to lower cost alternatives.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s for families &#45; not consumer units &#45; who still some leeway and aren&#39;t already to the point of doing without or going to the food bank.
When this does start to really percolate through the domestic economy, the final acts will be a complete realignment of our priorities as we reevaluate what&#39;s truly necessary versus that which we&#39;ve come to consider as necessary.

<title>How Do We Manage With Inflation?</title>
<body>Inflation or deflation?&amp;nbsp; After ongoing debate, the fog is clearing and significant rises in the commodity arena &#45; sugar, wheat, corn &#45; are harbingers of the inflation that the Federal Reserve has sought.&amp;nbsp; It also means that costs will be rising for the end users in the supermarkets.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m young enough to have a kid in the primary grades but old enough to remember the inflationary 1970s and have been asking myself, what did families do to manage with inflation then?&amp;nbsp; What are the best courses of action if inflation, whether stag&#45; or hyper&#45;, takes hold?

For those who are a bit fuzzy on the 1970s, inflation began prior to the decade when the consequences of funding both the Vietnamese War and the Great Society became apparent.&amp;nbsp; Too much money was chasing through the economy and prices started to rise.&amp;nbsp; Housewives protested the butcher shop when the price of hamburger began to hurt the food budget &#45; where do you think Hamburger Helper came from?&amp;nbsp; Prices however, rose across the board in a wide variety of items apart from food and inflationary expectations took flight.&amp;nbsp; While everybody talks about the supply shocks of having oil supplies cut off in 1973 and 1979, the reality is that inflation was already alive and thriving.&amp;nbsp; President Richard Nixon attempted to rein in the situation with statutory wage and price controls as far back as August 1971, a full two years prior to the first Oil Embargo. As you might expect, that effort failed &#45; miserably.&amp;nbsp; It took painfully high interest rates by then&#45;Fed Chairman Paul Volcker to bring inflation to ground.&amp;nbsp; In thirty years however, the company line on inflation has changed.
Understand that inflation is precisely what the Federal Reserve wants as it seeks to devalue the dollar.&amp;nbsp; With no end in sight to out of control federal spending and a grotesque national debt, the plan is to devalue the dollar so that this debt is paid for in dollars that hold less purchasing, if not actually valueless; the presumption however, is that the spending will be brought under control so that the debt really no longer grows and can be ultimately eliminated with these faux dollars.&amp;nbsp; The conventional thinking is also that the average family will return to spending &#45; with renewed credit &#45; as they use their dollars before they become further devalued.&amp;nbsp; For the Fed, it&#39;s a policy two&#45;fer as consumption increases while the national debt and interest payments are rendered manageable.&amp;nbsp; With the Volcker experience of the 1980s under their belt, the central bankers believe that they can bring inflation back under control after they&#39;ve achieved the policy gains.
So, what did our parents and grandparents do during the inflationary 1970s?
First, they surely didn&#39;t spend more, as the following graph demonstrates.

&amp;nbsp;They went the opposite way, ratcheting up savings during periods of economic stress.&amp;nbsp; Granted, not only had the average real income risen for decades previously, but the percentage share that the average US consumer spent on non&#45;necessities (exc food, clothing, housing/affiliated expenses) had grown significantly.&amp;nbsp; In 1934&#45;35, the average US family spent 23.8% of it&#39;s money on non&#45;necessities while that rose to fully 49.9% in 2002&#45;03.1&amp;nbsp;
The surprising part of the savings increase though, is that it really didn&#39;t come from the non&#45;necessity category.&amp;nbsp; The previous inflationary period was from the early 1970s to the mid 1980s; non&#45;necessity spending as a percentage of total spending rose from 42.6% in 1972 to 48.6% in 1985.&amp;nbsp; If savings during that period ranged from 8 to almost 12% while spending on discretionary items rose, where did the savings come from?&amp;nbsp; It would have had to come from the necessities category of housing/food/clothing.
So what else did our parents and grandparents do?
Many of them went back to gardening and growing their own food to reduce the rising costs.&amp;nbsp; In a 2009 USA Today article, an executive with a seed company noted that vegetable seed sales were fully 40% higher than in 2007 and they hadn&#39;t &amp;quot;...seen this kind of spike in 30 years.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Which places us back in the period when savings were peaking&amp;nbsp; between 10% and 12% of income. One of the retrospectives at the time pertained to the Victory Gardens that their parents had grown to supplement the World War II war effort.&amp;nbsp; Between this gardening and the subsequent low domestic food prices, the percentage of income spent on food dropped from almost 20% in 1973 to 13% in 2003.&amp;nbsp; With an inflationary&amp;nbsp; uptick in food and commodity prices, that percentage spent on food will rise upwards again unless families return to gardening on a scale reminiscent of the 1940s era.
Our parents and grandparents likewise made due with consumer durables, such as automobiles and appliances.&amp;nbsp; Vehicles in the 1970s were nursed along so that a family had a vehicle for much longer than today&#39;s family might.&amp;nbsp; Cars and appliances would be repaired again and again until they really were at the point of complete breakdown.&amp;nbsp; Legendary investment manager Peter Lynch once wrote that he realized that the auto industry &#45; and by extension, the market &#45; was ready for a run in the 1980s when he recognized how far along was the age of the typical American family vehicle.
They also were at a distinct advantage in terms of clothing costs.&amp;nbsp; Sewing was far more prevalent then than today and families had fewer clothes &#45; and repaired them more frequently &#45; than would occur today.&amp;nbsp; The percentage spent on clothing by the average family then, which was much larger than the 2.9 figure today, was 7.8% while as of 2003 had dropped by almost half to 4.2%.&amp;nbsp; The Walmartization of the American economy is a principal cause of this as American textile jobs flowed overseas to regions with far lower labor costs so that mass market clothing, on a historical basis, became incredibly cheap.&amp;nbsp; Think about it:&amp;nbsp; when Junior rips a hole in the knee of his jeans, do you patch them or just get another pair at Walmart?
The impact of even relatively stable inflation would be significant, although there are things that we can do.&amp;nbsp; We can manage to hold the line by:

    extending the lifespan of high&#45;ticket items;
    re&#45;thinking our clothing needs and shopping habits;
    shifting back to some self&#45;sufficiency with our own gardens;
    simply deciding to forego some of the luxuries that have come to permeate our lives, such as the ever&#45;present cup of Starbucks.
    understanding that true leisure time might be in short supply as non&#45;work hours are taken up in the tasks necessary to tend gardens, cook more frequently and sew and mend more.

That&#39;s within our immediate grasp.&amp;nbsp; We need to also speak more forcefully and vocally about the policies that have brought us to this point, a central bank that&#39;s been corrupted by a financial system and a government that cannot control itself.</body>

<title>What It Means For The Kids - Reforming Housing Finance</title>
<body>A large part of a father&#39;s job is to teach and help prepare the kids for the world and that means that I have to actually follow what&#39;s going on in the world.&amp;nbsp; Much of my worldview is skewed by the knowledge that I have children who will someday have to contend with issues that are being impacted by actions taken now.&amp;nbsp; Given that, I just finished reading the US Treasury Report on the reform of the housing finance system, a k a what the hell do we do with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
Everybody knows that the housing market is a complete trainwreck and most are aware that the financial hulls of Fannie and Freddie are so shot full of holes that they&#39;ve gone into government receivership.&amp;nbsp; This report outlines the potential steps that the government proposes to bring stability back to the housing market and it&#39;s finance mechanism.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that the mortgage market revert back to a principally private domain with private funding and the only government involvement would be for targeted markets.&amp;nbsp; This involves revoking the $729,000 maximum conforming loan limit (probably not impacting our kids), increasing the cost of mortgage insurance (impacting our kids) and increasing the size of the downpayment to a minimum of 10% (again, impacting our kids).&amp;nbsp; With the expectation that the lion&#39;s share of lending for mortgages will revert back to the private sector, the handwriting is clear that the underwriting standards will be returning to the pre&#45;house mania standards of solid credit history, which will absolutely impact our children.&amp;nbsp; After all, the banking sector has to be a good steward of the money entrusted to them now that they can&#39;t slough it off on the taxpayer.
So here&#39;s the brief synopsis of what my kids will have to consider when they eventually wish to purchase a house:

    increased monthly premium for mortgage insurance from today&#39;s levels;
    higher downpayment as percentage of house price (from about 3% to at least 10%);
    higher credit scores.

&amp;nbsp;Intellectually, this is a good thing and something that has to happen for the system to right itself and recover.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve got a real problem as I look at it.&amp;nbsp; We know that the real income &#45; corrected for inflation &#45; of the average American is dropping or stagnant at best.&amp;nbsp; This means that the amount needed just to get into a house will be higher as a percentage of income and assets than the amounts which we&#39;ve had to pay in quite some time.&amp;nbsp; Given the poor savings habits of Americans, who collectively haven&#39;t saved 10% of their paycheck in decades, this drives the hope of homeownership further away from our children as the ability to gather a sufficient downpayment will be taxed.&amp;nbsp; Couple this with real concern about incipient food inflation, and the kids paychecks will be stretched just trying to keep food on the table.
I suspect that the Treasury authors understand this as well.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re blunt in their upfront assessment that their goal is not to put all Americans in their own homes, as proposed by George Bush.&amp;nbsp; Their goal is to reform the broken system so as to make it sustainable and&amp;nbsp; safe.&amp;nbsp; A later section of the report flatly states that work must be done to improve the state of financing for multi&#45;family housing in order to attract apartment building owners that will put sufficient money into the properties to make them passably habitable.&amp;nbsp; Hey, if the kids are gonna be priced out, we still gotta find &#39;em someplace decent to live.&amp;nbsp;
What truly bothers me however, is that the only way &#45; given these proposed changes and the existant income parameters &#45; for a home to be affordable to the kids is for the price to fall.&amp;nbsp; But this imperils the financial system as housing prices are the foundation of so many Collateralized Debt Securities and everything possible is being done to prevent that from happening.&amp;nbsp; So...my kids or the banks?&amp;nbsp; Guess where that one comes down.
What do I have to do to help prepare my kids for this scenario?&amp;nbsp; There are several things on which to work, but none of them are simple or foolproof.

    Speak frankly with the kids about buying a house.&amp;nbsp; First, a house isn&#39;t a home, it&#39;s a structure and ignore the advertising about buying a home.&amp;nbsp; While the kids might not understand all of the details, they&#39;ll get the underlying message better than you think that they might.

    Speak frankly about the need to save and then go out and model that behavior yourself.&amp;nbsp; Purchase items with cash that you&#39;ve saved in a coin jar or alter your own behavior.&amp;nbsp; Kids smell hypocrisy like stink on a skunk and they&#39;ll notice.


    Work with them to understand debt.&amp;nbsp; What exactly are the varying forms of debt and when are they appropriate?&amp;nbsp; How much debt should one be able to carry given a certain income level?


    Talk with them and teach them to be skeptical of what they hear and read.


In short, talk to them.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t just chat, but talk to them in the car or at the basketball hoop, ask them if they know anything about whatever and see what they say.&amp;nbsp; And while you&#39;re chatting about drugs, chat about the money, too.</body>

<title>Kindergarten:&nbsp; Ready?&nbsp; Get Set, Go</title>
<body>It&#39;s midwinter and the school signs have started appearing, reminding you that it&#39;s time to enroll your little girl for kindergarten.&amp;nbsp; You glance at her and you ask yourself the questions.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s five years old now, but is she ready?&amp;nbsp; Is it the same as when I went through Kindergarten?&amp;nbsp; What can I do to help prepare her for the experience? &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a big step for both of you and you want to assure that she&#39;s ready.
The fact that a child is five years of age is solely a baseline established by states as the minimal age at which a child should be able to start the mandatory educational process.&amp;nbsp; States set a certain date in the Fall &#45; September 1 or October 1, for example &#45; as the cutoff date by which a child must have reached the age of five to even enroll in kindergarten.&amp;nbsp; If the cutoff date is September 1 and the child turns five on September 8, then kindergarten almost always waits another year.&amp;nbsp; When most parents become concerned is when the child&#39;s birth date is in the several month period prior to the mandated cutoff date, and the question becomes whether or not the child is ready for the experience.
What are the considerations for kindergarten readiness?&amp;nbsp; John Berry is an accomplished educator with more than 25 years of experience as a kindergarten teacher and was kind enough to share his observations.&amp;nbsp; In Berry&#39;s experience, there are multiple areas that indicate that a child is ready for kindergarten.&amp;nbsp;

    Foremost is that she should be able to listen to directions and focus for a sustained period of time.&amp;nbsp; What is meant by sustained?&amp;nbsp; According to Berry, the rule of thumb is that an appropriate time frame is three times the child&#39;s age.&amp;nbsp; Remember that this is only a general rule and a child&#39;s shorter attention span isn&#39;t necessarily an indicator of future problems.
    The child should be able to separate from the parents.&amp;nbsp; Children are naturally apprehensive and nervous before kindergarten but must be able to spend time away from parents for the period of the school day, trusting that they&#39;ll be getting home.&amp;nbsp; Kindergarten teachers are skilled in handling the children who are distraught on the first several days of school but if there are too many in a single classroom, those first days will be difficult for everybody there &#45; students, teachers and aides alike.
    There should be an appropriate level of trust of strangers.&amp;nbsp; We scrupulously teach our children not to speak with strangers in order to help protect them from predators who might approach.&amp;nbsp; But kindergarten is a time for encountering all manner of strangers that range from teachers and aides to bus drivers, custodians and even other children.  Children should be able to learn to trust adults that they&#39;re only just meeting, yet still remember the stranger rules that they&#39;ve been taught.
    Children should have an ability to care for themselves in terms of personal hygiene, particularly with toilet habits.&amp;nbsp; Accidents will happen but the norm should be that the child can routinely clean herself after using the toilet.
    She should have age&#45;appropriate motor skills, such as the ability to cut with scissors and hold and use pencil or crayon.&amp;nbsp; According to Berry, one of the changes wrought by the No Child Left Behind legislation is an increased focus in school on readiness for reading and writing to the exclusion of the fine motor skills activities that would have occurred previously, such as playing with clay, for example.&amp;nbsp; There simply isn&#39;t the amount of time available to do those activities that were done before.
    There is an expectation that she also have a grasp of basic information such as shapes and colors, knowledge that can be learned in a good pre&#45;school program.

There are questions as to whether to send a child simply because she&#39;s reached the age of five and kindergarten educators have an axiom:&amp;nbsp; when in doubt, keep them out.&amp;nbsp; While it can apply to all children, there is an acknowledged tendency amongst parents to hold boys out a little longer because of slower maturation and emotional development.&amp;nbsp; There are no real issues with having a child wait a little longer, although it can creep up years later if the latter&#45;start child is getting a driver license ahead of his peers.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, there can be far more issues that arise when a child is enrolled in kindergarten before she or he is prepared and those issues will cluster about issues of maturity and emotional development.
If you aren&#39;t entirely certain about readiness for kindergarten, find out if your school district has an evaluation program.&amp;nbsp; If the district doesn&#39;t evaluate the students, you can have a conversation about readiness with your child&#39;s preschool teacher or other parents who interact with her.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of whether there&#39;s a formal evaluation or not, most kindergarten teachers would be happy to provide guidance on determining readiness for upcoming children.&amp;nbsp; Conversations with the schools and kindergarten teachers also help to determine what students might require additional assistance.&amp;nbsp; Schools are obligated to provide special assistance to children who might require it, so you shouldn&#39;t be surprised if you find that special needs children are in the class along with the adult aide.
Perhaps the key difference between your kindergarten experience and your child&#39;s is due to the No Child Left Behind legislation.&amp;nbsp; Kindergarten is no longer viewed as an almost free&#45;standing experience prior to the beginning of the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; school of first grade, but instead as a gateway to school.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, there is a greater emphasis placed upon reading preparation, writing and numbers than in the past and your prospective kindergartener will be expected to master more than would have been expected of you.&amp;nbsp;
As the months pass and September approaches, there are things that you can do to help prepare her for the big day.&amp;nbsp; Certainly, talk to her repeatedly and positively to help alleviate her concerns.&amp;nbsp; Take her to play at the school&#39;s playground in the evening&amp;nbsp; or on the weekend so that she can become familiar and comfortable with the school.&amp;nbsp; If the school has any summer activities for the incoming kindergarteners, make it a point to attend so she can meet her new classmates and teacher.&amp;nbsp; More school districts are starting brief on&#45;site&amp;nbsp; programs for preschoolers &#45; such as school library story times &#45; and if you have the opportunity to take her, attend one so that she can see what the inside of the school looks like.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, spend more time working with her on her fine motor skills with such play activities as modeling with Play&#45;doh, coloring with crayons, using connect&#45;the&#45;dot pictures and cutting with scissors.
She&#39;s entering a new world and you should understand that she&#39;s not going to be the only one learning as the year progresses.&amp;nbsp; While you might be nervous, as I was, know that there&#39;s considerable expert assistance to help your child adjust and have a great year.
Thanks, John.</body>

<title>Is Inflation Happening Now?&nbsp; Kraft Says&#8230;</title>
<body>Yes, or at least in several months.
Kraft Foods, a multinational corporation, announced that it will be raising prices in the next several months across several of its key brands to offset the effect of elevated costs of such commodities as sugar, wheat and rice.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ve absorbed the rising costs for months already and have watched their bottom line get pinched in the vise of rising input costs versus slack sales across some of the teen&#45;oriented product lines, such as gums and candies.&amp;nbsp; Apparently the kids have decided that in the competition for their dollars between candy and Apples, the Apples are going to win hands&#45;down.&amp;nbsp; According to the Yahoo Finance article, Kraft is joining the likes of Sara Lee, Kellogg&#39;s and JM Smucker in deciding to raise prices.
While what will happen is now discernible in the distance, when it will happen is a ball that&#39;s entirely in the air.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been apprised of months of economic data which points towards rising inflation.&amp;nbsp; The logic is inescapable since the finished products that sit on the store shelves are composed of the commodity inputs that are rising.&amp;nbsp; How quickly and how soon will these ripple through the supply chain before it gets to us?&amp;nbsp; That depends principally upon the companies that compose that chain, companies that are caught between weak consumer demand generally resistant to price increases and rising costs that force higher prices in order to maintain profitability.&amp;nbsp; But now we&#39;re seeing that the companies are finally starting to give way to the rising prices and as more leaks are sprung in the dam wall, those of us downstream in the chain will be hit harder.&amp;nbsp; When it reaches a critical mass to break the dam is now a legitimate question.
In the monthly PracticalDad February Price Index, the items that I price are generally store brand.&amp;nbsp; My sense and experience is that when someone is really trying to meet a budget, cost is more important than taste and reputation, so I concentrate on the lower priced generics.&amp;nbsp; While all of these corporate announcements are from major food producers, don&#39;t think that the store brands will be exempt as food retailing is an industry with a very thin profit margin and the rising input costs will apply even greater pressure upon the retailers.&amp;nbsp; They simply don&#39;t have the cushion that an entity such as Kraft has.
So buckle up for the ride and if you&#39;re like me, head on over to Costco for a bulk purchase of Kraft Mac and Cheese.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Friends vs Playmates</title>
<body>Children are cruel and one of the sadder moments of a parent&#39;s life is helping a distraught child learn the difference between a friend and a playmate.&amp;nbsp;
It really is simple when the kids are very small because of the large tendency to practice parallel play, in which the kids veer erratically between playing by themselves and playing with one another.&amp;nbsp; Two little boys can happily play their own backyard games apart from one another and then veer together to play with one another for a period, returning again to solo play after several minutes.&amp;nbsp; But as they develop emotionally and begin to actually interact with one another, then they begin to gain a measure of the other&#39;s personality and character.&amp;nbsp; Is he good at sharing?&amp;nbsp; Will he tease maliciously?&amp;nbsp; Does he get aggressively physical and is there some control over his impulses?&amp;nbsp; Kids do take a measure of one another and even preschoolers can assess that he&#39;s mean and I don&#39;t want to play with him.
But there are other issues that only become apparent as kids grow and these generally pertain to character and emotional development.&amp;nbsp; The covert cruelty raises its head and the damage begins to appear with the hurt child&#39;s feelings, self&#45;confidence and self&#45;worth.&amp;nbsp; It might not manifest itself directly but come out in other ways, such as a markedly decreased ability to handle tasks and frustration, loss of sleep or increased aggressiveness to release the pressure.&amp;nbsp; When the dam finally breaks and you determine that the others&#39; words are the source, then you can have the conversation about the difference between a friend and playmate.
One of the questions or comments is liable to be who else there might be with whom to play.&amp;nbsp; You can walk through the list of the other kids and then ask, does this child speak this way or say these things? and progressively winnow through the cast of characters in your child&#39;s life.&amp;nbsp; Take a few moments to touch base on the real difference between friend and playmate &#45; will a real friend turn the things that you&#39;ve said against you? And if a child breaks that simple rule, is this a person with whom you want to play?&amp;nbsp; Is the play so good that it&#39;s worth the potential upset and hurt that the other child can cause?
When I&#39;ve encountered the situations, I&#39;ve tried to leave the final choice on whether to play with our child, with the child clearly understanding that this is potential price that has to come with this other kid.&amp;nbsp; If it continues &#45; and there have been moments when it has &#45; then I&#39;ve finally refused to let the child play with the other out of school.&amp;nbsp; And in those rare circumstances, there really hasn&#39;t been any complaint at all.</body>

<title>When Encouraging Skepticism Comes Back To Bite</title>
<body>When I discovered that I was going to be a father for the first time, I spent time reflecting on my own childhood as a gauge to help determine what kind of father I hoped to be and what I wanted to emphasize with the kids.&amp;nbsp; One of the things that came back to me from my own father was the need to think &#45; about problem&#45;solving, about issues, about courses of possible (in)action (since doing nothing is also a possible route).&amp;nbsp; This was something that I&#39;d also try to inculcate among my kids but I broadened this to include helping them distinguish real meaning from the porridge bowl of crap presented by the various media.&amp;nbsp; I wanted the kids to learn to examine something and be able to determine if it was a load of crap.
While I expected that it could come back to bite, it was in an intellectual sense and I didn&#39;t expect it to be so personally difficult.
It was easier as the kids were younger but with the advent of the teen years, the questioning has become more personal and contentious.&amp;nbsp; There are things that I understand from additional decades of life that a young teen simply cannot comprehend and trying to explain them can be difficult as the words come slowly, with difficulty.&amp;nbsp; The conversation can reveal things about you that, for better or worse, smack of hypocrisy and teens can smell out hypocrisy like a hound on a scent.&amp;nbsp; I sometimes honestly wonder after a conversation with a teen whether I&#39;ve managed to get the import of my thoughts across or whether it&#39;s been garbled into some mutant pretzel shape.&amp;nbsp; And frankly, I believe that parents have a particular authority that flows from the sheer dint of parenthood and now I&#39;ve got kids questioning me.&amp;nbsp;
I can&#39;t have it both ways, raising kids to question why things are as they are and yet excluding my own paternal authority.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t fair to them, it undercuts everything that I&#39;ve attempted to teach and it encourages distrust.&amp;nbsp; So we&#39;ve had some contentious moments with frustrated conversations that have broken off and come raggedly together again later as we attempt to knit together a common understanding from what feels like the jagged edges of sheared metal.&amp;nbsp; There have been moments when I&#39;ve begged off of the question at hand, openly stating that I wanted the opportunity to think about how I wanted to say something so that it made sense.&amp;nbsp; There have likewise been moments when we&#39;ve come together again as one of us has sought the other out and &#45; as happened this weekend &#45; I&#39;ve had to acknowledge that the youth had legitimate points that required adaptation of my own actions.&amp;nbsp;
The point is that communicating with teenagers isn&#39;t always going to be comfortable and will take you far beyond your parental comfort zone.&amp;nbsp; Expect turbulence and expect some hard feelings and dark moments, but also expect that you&#39;re going to have to continue to engage with them as you both adapt.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; February 2011 Unchanged But Things Are Percolating Underneath</title>
<body>After a large rise from November to December of 2010, the February 2011 PracticalDad Price Index remained flat with an index level of 100.63 (November 2010 = 100).&amp;nbsp; While the overall remains static, the increasing cost of commodity&#45;related agricultural products within, such as wheat, cooking oil and sugar have finally started to rise along with that of coffee.
Within that figure, derived by pricing a basket of pre&#45;selected items at three unrelated grocery stores, was a large decrease in the cost of one dozen eggs by 14% that offset price rises in such commodity items as sugar (2.9%), flour (3.6%), canola oil (4.5%) and coffee (4.3%).&amp;nbsp; Sugar, flour and canola oil had their first price moves since the PracticalDad Index began while coffee&#39;s move followed a 9.8% jump from November to December of 2010.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s notable about the rise in the cost of coffee is how it&#39;s masked by stealth inflation;&amp;nbsp; throughout the four month period, only one of the three stores actually raised the nominal price on only one occasion.&amp;nbsp; Two of the three stores however, decreased the container size from the original 13 ounces to 11 and 11.3 ounces respectively so that the effective cost of coffee on the original 13 ounce basis rose.
I&#39;d like to touch upon a housekeeping note as to the index figures for the months of December and January.&amp;nbsp; When I&#39;m pricing different items, I pay particular attention to the item, size/quantity and cost so I didn&#39;t realize during those months that a 64 ounce carton of orange juice also varied by whether it was derived from concentrate &#45; the cheaper choice &#45; or not.&amp;nbsp; In these two months, the juice was subsequently priced with both varieties and I&#39;ve corrected the data to reflect the original juice non&#45;concentrate variety, which is higher, but that originally used in the November pricing.&amp;nbsp; The effect is to skew the data higher than the original index numbers, but the direction remains the same:&amp;nbsp; a sharp one month rise followed by two months at a lower level.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve made note of this and re&#45;evaluated other items as well to assure that this is simply a one&#45;item correction.
What else is notable in the February pricing?

    Eggs and butter both registered declines of 14% and 4.7% respectively to more than offset the increases in flour/sugar/cooking oil/coffee and other items.
    There are additional examples of stealth inflation as one chain has decreased the number of diapers per box from 104 to 96 and another began offering canned beans in a 15 ounce can, down from 15.5 ounces.&amp;nbsp; In each case, the nominal price of the items didn&#39;t change and I&#39;ve recalculated them on the original size to account for the adjusted prices.
    As the actual basic food staples &#45; flour, sugar, canola oil &#45; show their first increase and the business/financial news discusses the rising cost of these raw items, I&#39;m curious as to how long before the price for the finished goods also starts to rise.&amp;nbsp; These would include products such as bread, hot dog rolls, spaghetti and children&#39;s cereal.

For the record, listed below are the monthly PD Index figures, both original and revised.

<title>Keeping Up With The Rules</title>
<body>For a guy who&#39;s written about trying to maintain control of the household electronics, it was brought home the other night that I wasn&#39;t aware how enforcement has slid as more kids came along and they grew older.
Enforcement is part of the parent&#39;s job and I knew &#45; intellectually &#45; that I was being stretched as the kids multiplied and aged but a car conversation with Middle brought home how much.&amp;nbsp; Part of our primary defense on the personal computer is simply placement in the family room; with me and other siblings that would happily rat out the offender generally around.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;d previously had some age limits on use of the internet and allowable sites with Middle not being allowed on until a certain age and Middle pointed out that Youngest was allowed on at a younger age than he.&amp;nbsp; My retort was that Youngest had cleared a few specific sites for play and I&#39;d reviewed them &#45; which is true &#45; but Middle&#39;s response was that his younger brother was getting on without my permission and I wasn&#39;t challenging him.
This is, unfortunately, true.
The simple reality is that with more kids, activities and general stuff, I&#39;ve fallen into the trap of just checking on the site content but letting things ride for a short while before booting the child off.&amp;nbsp; In my mind, it was acceptable since I didn&#39;t have the time available at the moment to just deal with the probable distraction caused by Youngest, who&#39;d probably need or want something.&amp;nbsp; But my downfall was in failing to recognize how it would be viewed by an elder sibling who saw the youngest getting away with something, and he was entirely correct.&amp;nbsp; The other simple reality is that I&#39;ve gone back and reviewed some of the basic rules with Youngest, who will have to check in with me anytime that he wants to use the computer, and especially to go onto the internet.
The final reality is that I&#39;ve had to tell Middle that he was correct and that actions were being taken to rectify things.&amp;nbsp; And if Youngest just has to wait and entertain himself without a screen, then those are the breaks.

<title>Is There Too Much Screen?&nbsp; Guidelines On Establishing Household &#8216;Netiquette</title>
<body>Technology is constantly advancing and adapting and it&#39;s a given that the young are always ahead of the parents on the techno&#45;curve.  It&#39;s a given that many parents are looking back to the &amp;quot;good ol&#39; days&amp;quot; of their youth when they recall a simpler world &#45; although their parents and grandparents seemed to always say the exact same thing.  But the past ten years have provided an explosion both in the technological platforms available to people as well as forms themselves.  While our predecessors also had to contend with the notion of yakking teens, it was contained by the simple phone technology so that unless a teen had their own phone in their room, or gasp, their own phone line, the amount of information and the number to whom it could be disseminated was limited.&amp;nbsp; For several years, the technology has gotten ahead of the social fabric and now the adults are starting to push back, as noted in The Guardian article on the rising tenor and amount of criticism of the effect of social media on today&#39;s youth.
It&#39;s natural for the adults to push back against change and the jury is very much out on the entire affair.&amp;nbsp; But the article does have a solid point on what one person refers to as the lack of &amp;quot;netiquette&amp;quot; amongst the users.&amp;nbsp; While the hue and cry is about the social networking sites, the problem goes back further to the entire presence of screens within the home.&amp;nbsp; Since the widespread availability of cable television and the ability to run lines to multiple rooms, the number of kids with their own bedroom televisions has grown to fully 70%.&amp;nbsp; With the TV in the room and the door shut, the parents have no real idea of the amount of time being spent on television and unfortunately, this carries over to the affiliated screen devices &#45; laptops, PCs, and so on.&amp;nbsp; Given all of this, what can we do to help start to rein in the kids?

    If there&#39;s a television in the room, consider whether or not to actually remove it.&amp;nbsp; Most parents are reluctant since the kids &#45; of any ages &#45; can frankly behave like asses in order to inflict enough of their own punishment to make the parent reconsider, but if the time is obviously creating issues then it should be considered.&amp;nbsp; There are devices that can be installed with parental codes to shut down the device after a predetermined period, such as TVAllowance, and this might be a decent alternative.
    Understand that you&#39;re the parent and it&#39;s entirely both your right and your responsibility to keep tabs on the kids habits.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, we&#39;ve controlled the electronics and I still spend an inordinated amount of time kicking one kid or another off of a screen device.&amp;nbsp; Few children have mastered self&#45;control and this is simply part of being a parent.&amp;nbsp; Deal with it.
    Establish ground rules apart from the simple daily amount of time.&amp;nbsp; What is unacceptable use of the device?&amp;nbsp; Trying to surf adult or mature sites?&amp;nbsp; Sexting or cyber bullying?&amp;nbsp; Texting at inappropriate moments?&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s imperfect, lay out the scenarios ahead of time and then list the consequences.&amp;nbsp; Most of the house rules pertain to the cell phone since there&#39;s only one cable&#45;ready television and the family PC is in the family room and the texting rules are fairly simple:&amp;nbsp; No texting or phone use when we&#39;re at the table for any family meal; no texting or cell phone after 10 PM on any school night; no stopping something else just to respond to a text (if you&#39;ve started a game with Youngest, finish the damned thing).
    Keep to the consequences.&amp;nbsp; Children who grow up knowing that the consequences are enforced will give you less grief when you have to do it.&amp;nbsp; Those who&#39;ve been given more free rein will resist and this is where things can get ugly as the relationship can occasionally devolve into a test of wills.&amp;nbsp; You have to make a conscious decision as to how much argument you&#39;ll tolerate and stick to it.
    Make sure that the house rules are followed by the other kids that come into the house because failing to enforce on others while enforcing rules on your own is sending a horrible message to the kids.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t be surprised if other kids have a clue of the house rules already since kids talk.&amp;nbsp; Kids talk alot.
    Be careful of your own electronics use and whether or not it reflects the house rules.&amp;nbsp; Kids can smell hypocrisy a mile away and will point it out as happily as recent roadkill on the interstate.&amp;nbsp; Besides, time that you&#39;re spending on electronics while the kids are around is time that you&#39;re not spending with them.&amp;nbsp; That is perhaps the crucial element of being a father.
    Expect some confusion since what works at one age level simply doesn&#39;t work at another.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a firm believer in age appropriate and work hard to adhere to the philosophy that what&#39;s okay for older kids is terrible for&amp;nbsp; younger ones but that means that there can be more gray areas and simple confusion as I try to keep up with things.&amp;nbsp;
    Expect pushback from the kids.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re testing limits and relationships and it&#39;s likewise part of being a father.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not easy, but it&#39;s part of it.

There will be an ebb and flow to the electronics usage and there are times when it&#39;s okay to let things go, such as on a snow day.&amp;nbsp; The proof will be in what you see when the kids aren&#39;t online or onscreen.&amp;nbsp; How&#39;s their weight?&amp;nbsp; How&#39;s their sleep?&amp;nbsp; How are the grades?&amp;nbsp; How is their general behavior?&amp;nbsp; It will require regular evaluation and a whole lot of persistent effort.</body>

<title>So Are Parents Really To Blame?</title>
<body>American kids continue to fare poorly in comparison to much of the rest of the world&#39;s students and we&#39;ve thrown a ghastly amount of money at the issue to improve test scores.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve blamed the educational unions &#45; and yes, there is some validity to those criticisms of teacher protectionism &#45; and we&#39;ve blamed teaching methods as well as teachers themselves.&amp;nbsp; But a late 2010 poll by Stanford University in which they query adults found that fully 68%, more than two&#45;thirds, blamed parents themselves.&amp;nbsp; The surprising part of this was that more than half of both mothers and fathers agreed with the assessment.&amp;nbsp; But it goes beyond education however, into general behavior, and I myself wonder, are we really to blame?
If there is blame to be apportioned, then yes, we deserve the lion&#39;s share of it.
There&#39;s a confluence of elements that have made parenting today&#39;s children and teens especially difficult.&amp;nbsp;

    A changing and increasingly competitive economy that demands greater and more intense attention for the dwindling share of the economic pie.&amp;nbsp; The prototypical Monday &#45; Friday daytime workweek has suffered as more are thrown out of work or have to work part&#45;time at whatever hours they can in order to provide for food and a roof.
    A rise in the availability and prevalence of home electronics so that the large majority of American kids are plugged into some device for an average of 7 hours each day.&amp;nbsp; Couple this with the fact that many of these computers, game systems and televisions are in the kids&#39; bedrooms means that the parents effectively have little control over what the kids are viewing and seeing.
    A stubbornly high divorce and single parenting rate so that the kids are overseen by only one parent who also has other household responsibilities with which to contend.&amp;nbsp;
    A belief that there are limits to discipline and an increased permissiveness as parents shift away from being authority figures to something akin to friends and buddies.

Practically speaking, the parents who are around are being pulled in too many directions to effectively do those things that a parent needs to do &#45; communicate with, monitor, discipline and enforce.&amp;nbsp;
There are factors over which we have no immediate control, specifically jobs and to an extent, marital/parenting status.&amp;nbsp; We have to keep a roof over the head and food on the table and I honestly don&#39;t know how two people in a bad marriage can effectively keep things together for the kids.&amp;nbsp; But the other factors are huge and are very much within our power.
Those factors within our power are the presence of the electronics and their usage.&amp;nbsp; Does the child really need a cellphone?&amp;nbsp; Does the child really need a laptop or iPad that they can carry to their room?&amp;nbsp; Does each child require a game system or television set within their room so that they no longer have to leave that room to interact with the family?&amp;nbsp; The point is that we&#39;ve created &#45; and permitted &#45; an environment in which the kids are allowed independence to such an extent that there is no longer any required interaction with the remainder of the family and parents, and the ubiquitous presence within their rooms means that we&#39;ve ceded the ability to keep tabs on what they&#39;re watching and doing. I&#39;m not a fan of MTV and what they&#39;ve done with their new show Skins is a prime example of hypocrisy, greed and our inattention to the kids&#39; viewing.&amp;nbsp; If my basic arithmetic is correct, Skins was viewed by a total of 3.3 million in it&#39;s premiere with the majority &#45; 2.7 million &#45; of viewers between the ages of 12 and 17.&amp;nbsp; The basic arithmetic comes in with the fact that the majority here amounts to fully 82%.&amp;nbsp; My suspicion is that the majority of these kids have parents who aren&#39;t aware that they&#39;re watching the show in the first place.&amp;nbsp; It is entirely permissible and appropriate for a parent to set limits on what the child and teens are allowed to watch and this doesn&#39;t constitute censorship or cruelty in any way.&amp;nbsp; If they&#39;re watching something of which you don&#39;t approve, turn it off.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re not around because of work, block the channel or program entirely.
We as adults and parents have also largely bought into the line that kids really aren&#39;t all that different from adults, just less experienced and packaged in a pint instead of gallon container.&amp;nbsp; Despite what&#39;s been bandied about in the past, children are not just &amp;quot;little people&amp;quot; and while some say that it takes a village, the reality is that more than a few members of the village are working diligently to use the children as a wedge to separate you from your cash.&amp;nbsp; But in their growth, they bear a striking resemblance to plants.&amp;nbsp; They will absorb whatever attention they&#39;re given like a sunflower absorbs sunshine and will continue, like the plant, to twist themselves in the direction of the light source to get everything that they need.&amp;nbsp; Knowing this, it&#39;s imperative for their best interests and well&#45;being that you be the source.&amp;nbsp; The research is becoming abundantly clear that kids are not junior adults and it&#39;s imperative that we stop treating them as such.&amp;nbsp; Their brains are being reconfigured as they grow and scientists now peg the age at which the average brain reaches adulthood in the mid&#45;twenties.&amp;nbsp; If they&#39;re going to be out on their own in the world before that time &#45; Please God, let it be so &#45; then it&#39;s crucial that they have a solid foundation when they leave the household for the great wide world.
Many families do have to work hard to make ends meet and provide food and shelter.&amp;nbsp; But that doesn&#39;t mean that we can use that as a reason to absolve ourselves from the responsibility that comes with raising a child and it&#39;s ultimately in that that many do fall down.</body>

<title>Preparing the Kids:&nbsp; Teaching Value</title>
<body>There&#39;s a new economic reality on the horizon and the old ways of spending and consumption are simply going to have to change.&amp;nbsp; How do I prepare my kids for this new economic world when the message put out by the media continues to be one of consumption and spending?&amp;nbsp; The overarching concept is that if you have to spend, do so by concentrating on value so that you truly get the most bang for the dollar.&amp;nbsp; But how do I achieve that?
First, understand that some of the most effective lessons aren&#39;t taught in a sit&#45;down session around a table.&amp;nbsp; The kids really are watching and taking things in &#45; I was surprised several months ago to find that Middle mastered a particularly effective mimicry of one of my foibles &#45; and to wait for the opportunity to handle things like a classroom is to lose opportunity.&amp;nbsp; Because I believe that basic financial education is crucial for young people, it is something that I&#39;m usually aware of as I spend time with the kids.&amp;nbsp; The opportunities are plentiful as errands are run, trips taken or television is watched and when you see something, grab the chance to ask about it and explore it with them.&amp;nbsp;
In our household, we&#39;ve taken to watching periodic episodes of Pawn Stars and American Pickers and these provide great object lessons in finding value as well as negotiating.&amp;nbsp; In the case of Pawn Stars, one of the big lessons is that value is often a subjective concept.&amp;nbsp; You can read somewhere or hear that your collection of antique magazines is worth thousands, but it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to get.&amp;nbsp; Achieving that value depends upon multiple factors and some of those are probably beyond your control.&amp;nbsp; Another significant lesson is that when a negotiation begins, the final value can be radically different from the number named at the outset &#45; just because somebody names a number, it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s what they will settle for. &amp;nbsp;A corollary of the negotiation lesson is that in many cases, the people negotiating are influenced by factors far beyond purely monetary considerations.&amp;nbsp; I know what you&#39;re saying, but my great&#45;grandpappy loved that item and it would be insult to his memory to take less than what I just demanded.
Second, effective teaching is repetitive and has to be revisited again and again.&amp;nbsp; Teaching a middle&#45;schooler about the mechanics of compound interest can be done in one session but teaching the real meaning of it will take multiple repeated efforts until most truly grasp the concept.&amp;nbsp; Our trip doesn&#39;t pertain to what you see and want and I don&#39;t have the money for it.&amp;nbsp; A debit or credit card in the wallet doesn&#39;t mean that I have to use it.&amp;nbsp; Since most folks don&#39;t pay off their credit cards, does it make sense to purchase a Whopper Value Meal and continue paying for it over the course of the next three months?&amp;nbsp; No, I only brought enough in the wallet for this and I don&#39;t have extra for that.&amp;nbsp; Because the kids are fairly persistent in stating when they want something, the opportunities continue to present themselves.&amp;nbsp; As the older kids have aged, they&#39;ll even speak about wanting something but immediately follow with the comment that it doesn&#39;t make sense for one reason or another, or that they know that you won&#39;t do so for whatever reason that you&#39;ve taught over the years.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s occasionally done in a way to instill guilt but I don&#39;t usually feel guilt.&amp;nbsp;
Third, don&#39;t worry about specific details but stick to the general principles and hammer them again and again and again and again.&amp;nbsp; Some of my comments have become a form of family joke but the reality is that the lesson really does sink into their bones and it&#39;s visible on occasions when they don&#39;t even realize that they&#39;ve followed them.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I drive an eleven year old minivan nicknamed Gladys the Rolling Dumpster but when you listen to the kids talk, some of the underlying philosophy leeches through as comments are made about it&#39;s just a car, not a fashion statement.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Bingo. &amp;nbsp;The other aspect to this is that having a few hard and fast principles makes it easier to remember as well as explain.&amp;nbsp; My memory&#39;s just not good enough to recall all of LeRoy Jethro Gibbs&#39; forty&#45;odd rules.
Finally, try to stay consistent and on message since kids are great at smelling out hypocrisy.&amp;nbsp; There are times when I do veer from the norm financially and I try to remember to explain why I might be deviating from a usual principle.&amp;nbsp; For instance, I&#39;m not big into spending large amounts for kid&#39;s and teen&#39;s clothing since the kids are both growing and rough on the clothing and the kids are aware of my attitude.&amp;nbsp; But when Middle and I&amp;nbsp;went shopping for some clothing and waterproof hiking boots in anticipation of a winter campout, he was uncomfortable with the cost of a decent pair of boots and was surprised at my willingness to spring for them.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s an investment, son. &amp;nbsp;If you&#39;re going to do more camping and hiking, then you need to actually take care of your feet and especially so in sub&#45;freezing weather.&amp;nbsp; This isn&#39;t like a pair of Kmart sneakers that will get trashed sooner than later.&amp;nbsp; And even though you&#39;re almost guaranteed to outgrow these boots, I can pass them down to your younger brother since I can guarantee that he&#39;ll be able to fit into them.&amp;nbsp;

Not everything that I believe and teach is going to stick and&amp;nbsp;they&#39;re going to make some decisions that I find simply dumb.&amp;nbsp; Hell, I make some decisions that some would find simply dumb.&amp;nbsp; But the more that I can pass along to them to help prepare them for this new economic&amp;nbsp;reality will hopefully make their life easier.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; January 2011 Index Drops to 100.55</title>
<body>The trips to the stores are done and the data is crunched, and the results of the January 2011 PracticalDad Price Index show that the index of the market basket in January dropped from 100.78 to 100.55.&amp;nbsp; For all of the talk about the threat of inflation, the index is down for the month so inflation must be a bogeyman...or not.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s take a look at the results in some detail after one or two comments.&amp;nbsp; First, data doesn&#39;t present itself in a steadily increasing or decreasing line from one month to the next.&amp;nbsp; On a monthly basis, numbers can bounce, chop and veer like a senator on a bender and it&#39;s on a rolling, averaged basis that trends become more clear.&amp;nbsp; Second, gathering prices can be complicated by a store&#39;s decision on various products, such as whether to swap out one product for another and this is something that I encountered during the price surveys.&amp;nbsp; In two instances, the absence of a product from the shelves caused me to simply not price the item at that particular store.
And now for some comments and the results.

    Multiple items rose in price &#45; especially in commodity based categories such as rice and grains &#45; but these were offset principally by the drop in cost of a single item, specifically a pound of cooked ham lunchmeat.&amp;nbsp; In this instance, the danger of a small market basket priced at three stores showed as one store apparently swapped out a product with a much lower cost competitor so that the monthly average for that item skewed downwards.
    Cereals &#45; store brand kids&#39; frosted flakes, oatmeal and store brand rice chex &#45; all rose in price with the frosted flakes rising almost 15% in a three month period.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, a pound of spaghetti rose from an average of $1.11/lb to $1.18/lb.
    Canned vegetables showed a slight rise from $.89/can to $.92/can and this is attributable to a single store with significant price rises in these items while the other stores held constant.
    Store brand vanilla ice cream has shown a consistent rise in three months from November&#39;s $1.85/qt to January&#39;s $2.04/qt.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s interesting in this case is that one store that held the item price constant did however, change the unit cost from a quart basis to a pint basis, setting up a possible future run&#45;up in price.&amp;nbsp;
    Other prices remained flat or bounced around a bit and in another article, I&#39;ll start with a three&#45;month rolling average for the prices within the marketbasket.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Honoring The Other Parent, Honoring The Other Child</title>
<body>One of my cardinal rules of fatherhood &#45; and one of the hardest to maintain &#45; is to keep my mouth shut when I&#39;m irritated with my mate.&amp;nbsp; Raising kids can be difficult enough and when the parents are upset with one another, it&#39;s easy to spout off about the other parent in front of the kids.&amp;nbsp; The problem with doing this is that it eventually creates an atmosphere in which the child becomes a co&#45;conspirator with the mouthy parent and places the kid in a position in which no child should find herself.&amp;nbsp; The out&#45;of&#45;favor parent subsequently has greater difficulty maintaining control and it&#39;s not beyond some kids to practice a divide&#45;and&#45;conquer strategy which can truly damage, if not destroy a marriage.&ampamp;nbsp; For the most part, I&#39;ve been successful in following this with a very few exceptions.
But with kids growing and each child fully capable of creating unrest and irritation without assistance, I&#39;m finding that I have to learn to apply the same rule when I&#39;m frustrated with their siblings.&amp;nbsp; Dealing with small children is akin to a real&#45;life version of Laura Numeroff&#39;s If You Give A Mouse A Cookie and while the physical aspect does ease as they age, the degree of confusion can actually increase as they constantly change plans or act without thinking.&amp;nbsp; The frustration can worsen for a parent who&#39;s trying to keep tabs on things.&amp;nbsp; And because they&#39;re now more in the world and out of your sight than when they were young, the capacity for trouble increases significantly.&amp;nbsp; While I can repeat to myself that they&#39;re clearly not thinking because their brains are literally being rewired, the frustration can become severe; so severe that I find myself making comments in the presence of one or more of the other kids.&amp;nbsp;
Comments like calling a kid knucklehead are acceptable in the moment, but I&#39;ve found myself complaining about the kid in question &#45; and there are multiple kids in question &#45; to one or two of the other kids.&amp;nbsp; It might be one thing to actually sit down with one of the kids and ask them, provided they&#39;re old enough to have such a conversation, what he or she is seeing or hearing, but spouting off spontaneously in frustration.&amp;nbsp; Again, I&#39;ll have to work on adapting the Honor the other parent principle because of the potential problems that can arise if I don&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Continuing to vent in front of the kids creates a difficult dynamic as it raises the child to the level of the parent, a role for which he is patently unprepared.&amp;nbsp; Further, it creates an unhealthy situation in which one child is clearly on the out against the other parent and child.&amp;nbsp; Finally, it can lead to a sense on the part of the issues child that she is now clearly out of favor with the parent compared with the other children.
Kids are difficult and I shouldn&#39;t make it more difficult by shooting myself in my own foot with my own mouth.
Honor the other parent, honor the other child.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, shut up.</body>

<title>The Kids Still Want To Play</title>
<body>As the family grows and ages, the desire by kids to play with Dad diminishes as they develop their own circle of friends and immerse themselves with their own activities.&amp;nbsp; As my own father used to say, that&#39;s as it should be, and I respect that.&amp;nbsp; But even as they age, they still want to find ways to play even if they reach a place where it&#39;s not always&amp;nbsp;cool to&amp;nbsp;ask.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While they&#39;re becoming adults, they are still, in many ways, kids and they want to play.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, there are times when I want to&amp;nbsp;play as well.
While&amp;nbsp;there are instances where&amp;nbsp;I completely miss the signs and I&#39;ve had to learn&amp;nbsp;to look for them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Sometimes it&#39;ll be an overt&amp;nbsp;hey, do you wanna...? but it&#39;s sometimes the unspoken actions.&amp;nbsp; A kid comes in and starts physically picking and messing is an obvious note that she&#39;s ready to play.&amp;nbsp; A less obvious indicator is the older child who haunts you in your activities, hanging nearby but not actually saying that he wants to play.&amp;nbsp; There have been moments when I&#39;ve actually shifted rooms to see if the youthful spectre flits behind and if so, then it&#39;s an unspoken invitation to play.&amp;nbsp; The haunt won&#39;t actually voice his wish but the intent will become clear and it&#39;s up to me to put the ball into play.&amp;nbsp; I regret that there have been times when I&#39;ve been aware of the wish and I haven&#39;t taken the opportunity to mess around.
The nature of the play might change with the season or with age, but the desire is still there as the kids come back from their forays in the world to touch base and reconnect with the folks.&amp;nbsp; Be aware and take advantage of it since those days will come fewer and farther between.

<category>School</category>
<title>PracticalDad Homework:&nbsp; Helping Versus Doing</title>
<body>One of our mantras since the kids were very small is that all good things flow from schoolwork.&amp;nbsp; The school assigns a certain amount of work and our expectation is that it will be completed both correctly and in a timely fashion.&amp;nbsp; Well, it at least has to be done &#45; and also turned in, by the way &#45; by the appropriate deadlines; there does come a point at which the kid has to take his lumps for work that&#39;s not right so as the kids have advanced, I&#39;ve curtailed parsing every math answer and compound sentence.&amp;nbsp; But when they&#39;re dealing with new subject areas or don&#39;t understand something and come to me, where&#39;s the line between helping and doing?
I&#39;ve come to find the difference in:

    Is the child still sitting next to me;
    Who&#39;s holding the pencil;
    Who&#39;s answering the question;
    Are there electronics nearby to distract the kid?

So long as these four aspects indicate that the kid is involved in the process, then I&#39;ll spend as much time as necessary to help get the point across.&amp;nbsp; In the case of math, I&#39;ve even gone so far as to create additional problem sets and even a mock test.&amp;nbsp; But if I find that the kid is no longer invested in the process, then I&#3#39;ll shut it down.&amp;nbsp; Surprisingly, when the kids &#45; at least here &#45; realize that PracticalDad&#39;s done and now leaving them to their own fates, they become much more willing to invest themselves in the process.&amp;nbsp; It has led to some additional angst as we come to terms with the situation and there have been both times when I&#39;ve gone back as well as other occasions when I&#39;ve left in frustrated disgust.
Part of the homework process, if I think that I&#39;m being abused, is a clear and repeated warning that if there isn&#39;t immediate change then they&#39;re left on their own.&amp;nbsp; It can lead to significant efforts at manipulation but this back&#45;and&#45;forth between recalcitrant kids and insistent parents is &#45; I believe &#45; a power play on the part of the kids to see just how much they can push the limit and whether they can manuever to their advantage.&amp;nbsp; Despite this though, the kids really do want to know that you&#39;re involved and both interested and invested in their work.
The kids ultimately have to learn however, that if you&#39;ll walk away because they&#39;re sloughing off on you, then they really will be left on their own.&amp;nbsp; And for a kid, this is a scary place to be.

<title>Fatherhood and the American Idiot</title>
<body>Over the Christmas holiday, we took the kids to New York City for a Broadway weekend.&amp;nbsp; While my wife and Eldest took Youngest to see Lion King, I accompanied Middle to Green Day&#39;s American Idiot to satisfy his growing taste in punk rock.&amp;nbsp; It was surprising to see more than a few families there but what truly took me back was that I actually enjoyed the show, so much so that I stood for the ovation before my son did.&amp;nbsp; The jury is now out on whether the boy will continue listening to punk, but that&#39;s another article for another time.
What also took me aback was the implicit social commentary about the state of the times &#45; and the family &#45; for today&#39;s young adults.&amp;nbsp; Each of us views events through a prism shaped and framed by our own set of values and mine is clearly shaped by my concerns about the electronic media and role as a father.
While trying to not give anything away, the show&#39;s onset and continuing theme is framed by a constant barrage of electronic imagery with a grim message of crisis and war.&amp;nbsp; The young viewers watch it but you can&#39;t tell with the lights dim whether they&#39;re intent or simply slackjawed and it&#39;s shortly afterwards that the show breaks open with the cover song, American Idiot.&amp;nbsp; Much of the imagery additionally is in stark design and contrast and beats a rapid tattoo of crisis and impending war engineered by then President Bush and Vice&#45;President Cheney.&amp;nbsp; The older adolescents &#45; remember that according to prevailing medical experts, adolescence gives way to adulthood much later than 21 &#45; are functionally mesmerized by the swift panoply of imagery.&amp;nbsp; In real life, our teens and youngsters are watching more than 50 hours weekly on various screens and there is typically a constant shifting from one image to another so that there is far less linear thinking than there was when viewing was less.&amp;nbsp; Literally, before a person can even begin to critically examine something presented, they&#39;re jerked onto something else and then onto something entirely different afterwards.&amp;nbsp;
When you talk to people, some have few memories of their childhood experiences and when you talk to others, their memories tend to be more scattered, like three dimensional photos that have been pinned to a board for the mind to see.&amp;nbsp; What pulls these memory photos into some coherency are the thread lines that are placed between them, making each relatable in some fashion to the others.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s these lines providing the context and coherency that help pull the masses of images and experiences into something that makes fuller sense to the person.&amp;nbsp; As children age however, it becomes apparent that few, if any, are capable of placing that thread in a manner that permits them to make sense of what&#39;s happening around them.&amp;nbsp; So if there&#39;s going to be some understanding, then it&#39;s left to someone else to string the thread benefitting the youngster.&amp;nbsp; What struck me as I viewed the entire backdrop of the show was the sense that through all of the variety of images witnessed by these generations &#45; far wider than I ever had as a youth &#45; there&#39;s no one really helping them string the threads that bring coherence, leaving them with a giant mess in terms of understanding.&amp;nbsp; It becomes the blind being led by the blind, or those with their own agenda.
At moments in the show, the main character writes home to his mother and derogatorily mentions his stepfather, who has belittled and derided him.&amp;nbsp; There is only a single mention of his father and that is in a phrase coupled with God; while I seriously doubt that he maintains his real father in a god&#45;like position, the point is clear that in the moment that he views God with the same sense that he&#39;d view his own father, as someone who was far away but with whom he&#39;d want a relationship.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a hope in moments of distress that he&#39;s there and willing to listen to what you need to get off of your chest.
How do I pull of this together into a coherent whole?&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t just a diatribe against an apathy that permits an entire generation to electronically anesthetize itself while its parents seek their own relief and release.&amp;nbsp; The kids can be off of the machinery but if someone doesn&#39;t make a conscious and deliberate effort to take them in hand &#45; literally or figuratively &#45; then they&#39;ll still be badly uninformed and ill&#45;prepared for the world around them.&amp;nbsp; It will require an investment of time, but the good part is that it isn&#39;t time spent within a classroom or structured environment; it can be within the car, below the basketball net or simply walking the dog.&amp;nbsp; The point is to avail yourself and simply start talking and in the course of conversations, they&#39;ll begin to string the thread that helps connect and bring meaning to the mental pictures posted inside their heads.
Trust me, they&#39;re listening.

<title>What Do I Have To Teach Them?&nbsp; (Part 4)</title>
<body>One of a father&#39;s biggest jobs is to teach his kids.&amp;nbsp; Teaching situations are presented almost everywhere if you learn to look for them but some of the best teaching opportunities occur when you&#39;re traveling with the family.&amp;nbsp; During a Christmas trip to New York City, the opportunities abounded.

    Many restaurants post their menus outside for potential customers to review the meals and costs.
    If you enter a restaurant and the staff presents a limited menu verbally without benefit of presenting a printed menu, prepare for an expensive meal.
    If there&#39;s even hint of snow, take snow or hiking boots as well as hat and gloves.
    Who was Raoul Wallenberg and why is his name on a sign near the United Nations?
    What are appropriate tips for wait staff, doormen and hotel maids?&amp;nbsp;
    Is it ever appropriate to stiff the staff?
    How can I tell which direction is south in the afternoon?
    How are $1200 English handmade wingtips different from Payless wingtips?
    How do you protect your wallet, whether it&#39;s in your pants or in your purse.
    How do you say no to someone hustling you on the street.
    If you need to ask how much something costs, you probably shouldn&#39;t&amp;nbsp; buy it.
    Shoes by Prada are something you shouldn&#39;t even ask about in terms of price.
    If a store is having a 70% off sale, how much was the mark&#45;up prior to the mark&#45;down?
    Which fork is used for an appetizer or salad and what&#39;s the purpose of the spoon above my plate?
    Placing the used utensils on the plate at the four o&#39;clock position is a signal that you&#39;re done with your plate.
    The hotel and wait staff do remember customers based upon how they&#39;re treated.
    How to hail a cab.
    How to handle the tickets and seating on the train.
    Why trains really are superior to airplanes when the option is available.
    Is there any real value in the number of security/surveillance cameras on street corners?
    How to handle sore feet and muscles.
    The use of pockets in carrying additional gloves and knit hats.

The education is both verbal and non&#45;verbal and occurs even when you don&#39;t realize it.&amp;nbsp; Whether you realize it or not, they&#39;re watching and they&#39;re learning from almost everything that you do.</body>

<title>Dealing With It - That&#8217;s What Dads Are For</title>
<body>There are definitive differences in how fathers and mothers relate to children&#39;s moods and response to new situations.&amp;nbsp; Because they have no wealth of experience with which to compare how things are versus how they could be, children can be cranky and unpleasant when confronted with new situations, sensations or circumstances that they don&#39;t like.&amp;nbsp; From my experiences watching mothers, many will attempt to reason with the child or explain things, or get the child to verbalize what it is that they&#39;re feeling and that is, all in all, a worthwhile approach.
This isn&#39;t usually the case with fathers since men are generally neither as verbal nor patient as women.&amp;nbsp; While some men can chat happily about a multitude of topics, get us onto issues of emotion and feelings and we&#39;re about as communicative as a mute with a lisp.&amp;nbsp; Even if we can verbalize what&#39;s on our minds, we&#39;re too impatient with children who will meander through any number of issues before finally &#45; maybe &#45; stumbling onto the item that&#39;s really bothering them.&amp;nbsp; Get to the point, get to the point, get to the point...
I admire mothers who are willing to expend the time necessary in these situations.&amp;nbsp; But there is also real value to the male approach of getting to the point and helping the child learn how to simply deal with it and move on.&amp;nbsp;
This Christmas holiday was a case in point.&amp;nbsp; We took the kids to New York City by train to sightsee, take in a Broadway show and experience firsthand a certifiable city&#45;closing blizzard.&amp;nbsp; The practical upshot was that there was absolutely no opportunity for the kids to whine about taking a cab and we were able to happily walk all over Midtown Manhattan.&amp;nbsp; The amount of snow and slush was deep enough in spots to overflow the tops of the snow boots that the kids wore and feet and socks got wet as we trudged up West 49th.&amp;nbsp; Youngest did get wet feet and as he complained about his feet, we noted that Saks Fifth Avenue was nearby.&amp;nbsp; The thing about whining children is that they really are the gift that keeps on giving, continuing and cycling even when the original cause has been rectified.&amp;nbsp; Since it hadn&#39;t occurred to me to actually put a spare pair of dry socks in my coat pocket, my wife and I agreed that getting a dry pair of socks was reasonable.&amp;nbsp; The fact that it was Saks Fifth Avenue made it &#45; in the eyes of my wife and daughter &#45; a certifiable slam dunk, can&#39;t miss two&#45;fer.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, this was meaningless to Youngest, who&#39;s a male and looks at department store shopping with the same sense as awaiting a root canal.&amp;nbsp; Even when we explained why we were going in, his attitude darkened further and the whining ratcheted upwards.
We exited at the sixth floor &#45; Youngest&#39;s feet are big enough that he was in men&#39;s shoes before he could spell men &#45; and wandered back to the sock area.&amp;nbsp; We found a pair of cotton athletic socks and I took it to a cashier in a different department since our local salespeople were contending with millionaires pondering their AARP discounts.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, if you&#39;re able to afford a handmade pair of English wingtips, you&#39;re embarrassing yourself to wonder aloud whether you could get a discount on it.&amp;nbsp; The salesman was a dapper, distinguished looking African American gentleman who wore his gray hair far better than I wear mine.&amp;nbsp; His eyebrow cocked slightly at my single pair of socks and when I told him to forget the bag, I explained it&#39;s immediate use for a little boy with wet feet.&amp;nbsp; We talked for a brief period and when I stated that Youngest would simply have to wear them and get on with it, he nodded and broke into a wide grin, exclaiming that&#39;s what Dads are for. &amp;nbsp;
When I returned to our area, Youngest was still surly and my wife was still trying to get him to explain what it was that was bothering him.&amp;nbsp; The entire time that I was away, my wife had attempted to talk him through which was admirable but useless.&amp;nbsp; I knelt next to him and my thoroughly annoyed point to him was that he now had two options.&amp;nbsp; The first was to put the dry socks on his feet and we&#39;d continue on to see our sights and have a wonderful afternoon.&amp;nbsp; The other option was to leave the wet socks on and continue on to see our sights since I refused to return eight blocks to the hotel for a dry pair of socks.&amp;nbsp; Since we were here purely to help him, he&#39;d have to accept the help or have to deal with the discomfort and complete lack of sympathy from his father.&amp;nbsp;
What&#39;s my other option?
There is no other option.&amp;nbsp; Take the dry socks or suck it up and deal with it &#45; and I&#39;ll have no sympathy.
Youngest accepted the first option and donned the dry socks as I deposited the wet ones in my coat pocket (he wore them the next day when his socks got wet again).&amp;nbsp; He wasn&#39;t happy with the options but the stark presentation broke the cycle since he was now able to focus his anger on me instead of on the discomfort.&amp;nbsp; The attention turned from an internalized unhappiness to something that existed beyond himself and when he worked through it in several minutes, his original complaint was rectified and then forgotten.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s easier to learn to deal with it &#45; whatever it is &#45; when you&#39;re older because with age generally comes an awareness of others as well as a sense of proportion.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s also better learned when you recognize that it&#39;s not going to be neither tolerated nor encouraged.&amp;nbsp; So my wife and I will continue the ongoing balancing act as we attempt to help the kids learn to verbalize their thoughts and feelings while still learning how to deal with things so that they don&#39;t take over completely.
And if you&#39;re ever in the position of buying a pair of $1200 handmade English wingtips, just buy the damned things and stop kvetching.</body>

<title>Is Inflation Happening Now?&nbsp; McDonalds Says&#8230;</title>
<body>...Yes, but they&#39;re holding off on price increases until they see whether and how the economy&#39;s improving.&amp;nbsp; This little tidbit, along with information gleaned from other restaurant executives, is presented in an article on Agweb, a commodities business site.
The question of whether the economy is suffering from inflation or deflation &#45; or even what I refer to as hyperstagdisindeflation &#45; has been the debate for months and it&#39;s only now that further information is becoming available to clarify the picture.&amp;nbsp; The gist of the article is that restaurant chains have been seeing commodity price increases but have been successful thus far in mitigating the rises via contract lock&#45;ins, addition of new producers and old&#45;fashioned sucking up the prices and taking the bottom line hit.&amp;nbsp; However, they&#39;re watching the economy&#39;s general performance to ascertain when things are sufficiently recovered to pass along the prices to the consumer.&amp;nbsp; When the consensus is that recovery has taken hold, then expect to see price increases as the restauranteurs move to recapture some of the profit margin that they might have given up.&amp;nbsp; If the economy, which they&#39;re measuring by the unemployment rate, doesn&#39;t improve then they&#39;ll have to hold off as long as possible before finally giving in to meal price increases.
As my wife asks, what does this mean for my family?
As I&#39;ve occasionally told her, choose your poison.&amp;nbsp; Our stated unemployment rate (U&#45;3) is now at 9.8% and the more realistic U&#45;6 rate is above 17% and the average family income continues to decline so there&#39;s no leeway in free disposable income.&amp;nbsp; People will continue to cut back on restaurants and there will come a time when the average restauranteur is faced with no choice but to raise prices or fold.&amp;nbsp; So we can keep bumping along with no real employment/wage improvement and keep the prices level or we can watch jobs grow and the prices rise at a rate likely higher than the wages.&amp;nbsp;
What this means for this particular family is that despite the chaotic schedules, my plan is to almost completely eliminate restaurant dining in 2011 in favor of fully home cooked food.&amp;nbsp; We reached the point at which it was easier to grab a quick restaurant meal for sake of the schedule but the drive to cutback spending will simply require that the family and I adapt our palates and expectations accordingly.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll still see price rises in the grocery store but will still be able to manage it better than just throwing money down a restaurant&#39;s hole.
While McDonald&#39;s sounds respectable for keeping things under control, the time will come when they choose the profit margin over the typical American family.</body>

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s First Rule of Fatherhood Revisited</title>
<body>Like Jethro Gibbs, I believe that there are certain rules that one needs to follow to make it through life and that includes fatherhood.&amp;nbsp; One of the first articles that I wrote pertained to PracticalDad&#39;s First Rule of Fatherhood and given some situations I&#39;ve encountered in the past several weeks, I&#39;d like to revisit that rule again.&amp;nbsp; Until your child is grown, your life is no longer your own.&amp;nbsp; Now repeat that three times and please do so loud enough for everyone else to hear.
Women&amp;nbsp; really do civilize men and perhaps the final part of the civilizing process is getting men to stand and be responsible for their families.&amp;nbsp; This bundle presently sleeping/suckling/resting in your arms is now wholly and fully your responsibility and will be so until they are old enough to make their own way in the world.&amp;nbsp; That phrase &#45; make their own way in the world &#45; is incredibly vague and there really aren&#39;t any hard and fast rules as circumstances and offspring abilities vary from one family to another.&amp;nbsp; But there are some things that don&#39;t vary.&amp;nbsp; Your child needs and desperately wants your support as they grow &#45; in school, in sports, in activities, in whatever is happening.&amp;nbsp; There are moments when you might not be able to make an event and kids are both smart and forgiving enough to deal with that.&amp;nbsp; But if your child is going to really thrive and prosper, then she needs to know that Dad is fully behind her in her efforts.&amp;nbsp; For the purposes of what I&#39;ve been witnessing, it&#39;s not just Dads but Moms who are also screwing the pooch on this rule.
What does that mean?&amp;nbsp; Do I have to become a soccer dad or someone who only finds fulfillment living vicariously through my child?&amp;nbsp; No, but it does mean that you have specific basic responsibilities such as providing food and shelter, and assuring that the child is educated.&amp;nbsp; Those are simply the bare&#45;bones rudiments as kids, in order to really flourish and grow, require constant interaction. The more that they&#39;re around you and really interacting with you, the more that they&#39;ll start to blossom.&amp;nbsp; With work and any other responsibilities that you have, you will wonder when you get time to yourself and there&#39;s nothing wrong with a little &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; time, but that time is &#45; and has to be &#45; drastically scaled back from when you were single or didn&#39;t yet have children.
The reason for reviewing this first rule of fatherhood &#45; even parenthood, actually &#45; is because of multiple situations that I&#39;ve seen in which the kids are being simply ignored.&amp;nbsp; Some parents are thinking that since the kids are now teens, they ought to be able to fend for themselves as the folks head out.&amp;nbsp; My wife recently forwarded me an email with a Facebook posting for a teen whose parents were taking a January cruise and had told the teen to find herself a place to live for the week that they&#39;d be gone.&amp;nbsp; Staying at home was out of the question since the house was heated by woodstove and they didn&#39;t trust her to not set an accidental fire, yet they were perfectly happy to let the kid find herself a place to stay. So let me get this straight:&amp;nbsp; you haven&#39;t taught the teen the rudiments of how to keep the house warm with a wood stove and don&#39;t trust her to not set the house ablaze but you&#39;re alright with leaving for a week and telling the teen to find another place to live for that week.
Another teen has no parental support and attendance for something like National Honor Society Inductions and Regional Science Competitions.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a recent razor commercial in which boys look into the stands and audiences full of people and the only person that they note is Dad; these kids want their fathers &#45; and mothers &#45; there and they want them there desperately.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re going to have a kid, bloody well make sure that you understand that your evenings and weekends are going to be spent on the basics with the kids, even if there are no sports or activities.&amp;nbsp;
The responsibility continues even as they age.&amp;nbsp; Teens are not adults despite their quaint notion that they are and leaving them without any supervision is simply asking for a disaster.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s at this point that a father has to pick and choose the battles and stand the ground against the some of the utterly insane ideas that these cranially challenged teens have.&amp;nbsp; There are days that I live in a state of perpetual annoyance and there are moments when I&#39;ll decide that the kid has to learn a lesson the hard way.&amp;nbsp; But there are also days that I have to bear down and stick to the rules despite the commentary, arguments and actions of the teens.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t look forward to it but that&#39;s simply part of my job and whether they&#39;re too damned dumb to realize it or not, my contrariness really is about them and not my desire to force someone to stick to rules for the rules&#39; sake.
Fatherhood &#45; parenthood &#45; is the endurance race and to make it, you have to look to the goal ahead and ignore the various complaints that you have because it&#39;s not about you.</body>

<title>What Do You Give A New Dad?</title>
<body>I was pleased to find out today that a young friend is now officially a father for the first time.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve known that it was coming and had the mother&#39;s present ready but didn&#39;t really know what to give the new father.&amp;nbsp; What is a good gift for a new father?
Depending upon their circumstances, new parents can find themselves utterly awash in goods and items.&amp;nbsp; There will be showers and various other gifting opportunities and a young couple can really stock up, but these are generally items for the family situation &#45; blankets, towels, devices, supplies.&amp;nbsp; Women will always be able to figure out something that&#39;s for the new mother since many of them have either been through the pain of childbirth or have actually paid attention when their friends went through it.&amp;nbsp; But what do you get for a guy?&amp;nbsp;
Many products for guys are recreation oriented and while that&#39;s nice, the reality is that such gifts help to draw the guy&#39;s attention out of the household and away from the family.&amp;nbsp; Golf clubs?&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re a great gift but that guarantees several hours at a time away from the home and family.&amp;nbsp; Tools?&amp;nbsp; Better, since they can serve a purpose that at least keeps the guy around the house.&amp;nbsp; But some men just aren&#39;t all that handy or into tools for the sake of tools.&amp;nbsp; Except Bill, but he&#39;s an exception.&amp;nbsp; Today&#39;s reality is that women are stretched between work and home and the kids desperately need love and attention more than anything so gifts that pull a father&#39;s focus from the household is actually counterproductive.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, men simply don&#39;t have the same sensibilities as women and would look askance at the great majority of items that might please the mother.
So what to do?&amp;nbsp;
As I ran errands the other weekend, the choice occurred to me as I passed a Tobaccionist&#39;s shop and I stopped and purchased both a Cohiba and an Arturo Fuente for the new father.&amp;nbsp; While I only occasionally smoke a cigar, it is true that a really good cigar is a different taste and experience; as the old saying goes a woman is a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve had to wonder, what it is about cigars that has made them a time&#45;tested fatherhood gift?&amp;nbsp; Some psychologist somewhere might make a comment about phalluses and fatherhood but I do think that it&#39;s different than that.&amp;nbsp; Smoking a cigar is truly an aqcuired taste and one that requires a certain amount of practice and time to truly appreciate.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a truism that in previous times, fathers who wanted to break their kids of smoking would start them on a cigar. Certainly there are women who appreciate a good cigar but I simply think that a cigar is best appreciated by men and giving such an item is a nod to a guy&#39;s finally taking that final step to the fullest aspect of manhood, being a father.
Come to think of it, perhaps I&#39;ll send the Fuente and smoke the Cohiba myself.

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s Wife:&nbsp; So What Does It Mean For Us?</title>
<body>My wife considers me the family prairie dog, spending his time out of the hole and persistently sniffing the air and surveying the horizon.&amp;nbsp; I spend time surveying the on&#45;going slo&#45;mo changes in our economy and try to adjust accordingly depending on what I suspect might happen, and so far, I&#39;ve been right more often than not.&amp;nbsp; That said, I took my drubbing on a Double&#45;Short Treasury ETF (TBT) manfully and resolved to never again walk in that segment of town.&amp;nbsp; Otherwise, I keep my eye on what&#39;s happening and despite that, there are still moments when I really don&#39;t know what to answer when my wife looks at me and asks so what does all of this mean for our family?
That&#39;s a damned fine question and I honestly wish that I had a clear answer.&amp;nbsp; But I will &#45; finally &#45; lay out when I anticipate might happen and what I&#39;m doing otherwise but don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not going to shill for weapons/ammo/clean water filters and GoldLine.&amp;nbsp; I work hard to not wear a tin&#45;foil hat and refuse to put one on now.&amp;nbsp; Let me start by saying that I try to look at events beyond the 24 hour CNN newscycle and in the context of a longer timeframe.&amp;nbsp; Americans have notoriously short attention spans, made shorter by the CNN newscycle.&amp;nbsp; Unlike here, there are countries well versed in their past and so much so that they still hold grudges, such as the Serbians who took apart Sarajevo in the early 1990s.&amp;nbsp; If you have to remember who the Serbians are and what happened in Sarajevo during the early 1990s, then you need to start thinking beyond the newscycle span.&amp;nbsp; My second reference frame is the idea that life and systems are entropic.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My kids aren&#39;t completely the same as they were six years ago nor am I completely the same man that I was 30 years ago.&amp;nbsp; This holds true as well for systems of governance and currency as new pressures and dynamics alter or overwhelm the existing structure.&amp;nbsp;
I couple these two points because there&#39;s no reason in the world that we are so special as to not be alive during a time of major societal or economic change.&amp;nbsp; When the Soviet Union fell in 1990, some yahoo wrote a book entitled The End of History.&amp;nbsp; Even then, I found it offensive as it presupposed that now that capitalism had vanquished communism, there were no other conflicts in the offing and we could trot merrily on our way into an Ayn Rand Utopia.&amp;nbsp; So long as there are teenage boys and a video recorder, there is potential for something spectacular to occur.&amp;nbsp; If it involves a skateboard, a roof and a firepot, it could even be historic.
So what am I looking at?
1.&amp;nbsp; The end of the dollar as the reserve currency.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, there are as many currencies out there as countries and none of them are the reserve currency, so how bad can that be, right?&amp;nbsp; Technically, that&#39;s correct and there&#39;s some long&#45;term good that could come out of it but the problem will be the short and intermediate before the long&#45;term.&amp;nbsp; Resets can be a bitch.
Listen to an auctioneer at the outset of the bidding for any piece just being offered and you&#39;ll hear him asking to start the bidding at a specific point.&amp;nbsp; If there are no bids at that suggested price, then he&#39;ll continually drop the opening bid to a point at which someone finally thinks there&#39;s value.&amp;nbsp; Substitute the dollar for the item being auctioned and it&#39;s the same.  Our fiat currency is accepted primarily because the world believes that the full faith and credit of the US Government stands behind the buck.&amp;nbsp; But with our 2010 end of year debt at about $14 trillion, and more on the way, the world seriously doubts that the debts can be repaid.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the Federal Reserve system is happy to trade cash for various forms of US treasury notes, effectively monetizing the debt &#45; which is econobabble for printing money.
At some point in the future, the rest of the world will move from the dollar to something else and the rest of the world includes the oil producers who sell us more than half of our oil supply. The rest of the world will shift out of dollars into something else, so the dollar is less valuable and worth less, and they&#39;ll want paid in something else besides dollars.&amp;nbsp; If the dollar is then worth less compared to everything else, then it will take more dollars to buy oil and that will ripple through the system creating inflation as it goes.
2.&amp;nbsp; A nation with both political and economic power concentrated amongst a small minority, aka an oligarchy. When even USA Today writes openly about the size of the income gap between poor and wealthy Americans, then it&#39;s now both mainstream and noticeable.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s always been a gap in the US, but it&#39;s reaching a point that&#39;s honestly frightening as the nation sets records for food stamp participation &#45; 43 million and rising.&amp;nbsp; Couple this with the frustrated efforts to control the money flowing into the coffers of our elected politicians and the cards are increasingly stacked against the growing majority of our children.
3.&amp;nbsp; A system of higher education that is increasingly affordable only if the student and family incur significant debt, some of which simply can&#39;t be repaid in today&#39;s economic environment.&amp;nbsp; When a young person comes out of college with tens of thousands of dollars in debt, that&#39;s money that they can&#39;t spend on setting up their own lives and families.&amp;nbsp; They defer decisions that are ultimately important to our greater society, such as becoming full&#45;fledged adults capable of supporting themselves and starting their own families. Unless and until this country gets back to producing what the rest of the world wants and needs, then the employment will continue to be largely service/government oriented which is akin simply to rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.
So what does that mean for me and my family?

    We&#39;ve planned and saved for a large trip in 2011 and we&#39;ll continue to do so.&amp;nbsp; That said, the other spending will be ratcheted downwards and multiple requests for different things have been shot down peremptorily with the word Europe.
    Starting on January 1, restaurant meals will be finished.
    We&#39;ll continue to speak purposefully about spending as well as the appropriate use of credit.
    Grades will continue to be pushed and as the kids age, we&#39;ll overtly talk about scholarships and other forms of low&#45;cost higher ed alternatives.
    As Eldest toys with a hard science versus a soft science college, we&#39;ll make sure that she&#39;s aware of the advantages of a hard science (think biology) over a soft science (think psychology) in the workplace.
    Political conversations have already taken on a harder tone with a harder edge.&amp;nbsp; There is clearly a system in place that immediately places young people at a disadvantage at a time when they are financially disadvantaged enough already and to ignore it&#39;s existence is simply foolish.&amp;nbsp; For example, when Senator Bernie Sanders (I &#45; VT) gave his eight hour filibuster last week, I made certain that the two kids at home heard at least a few minutes of it and what it meant.&amp;nbsp; Simply put, we&#39;re passing the point at which it&#39;s best to appear balanced and are better suited now to clear political advocacy.
    I&#39;ll contine to spend time explaining the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; examples in finance and economics.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s been surprising to understand that despite the rolled eyes, they really are listening to what&#39;s being said.

What&#39;s happening and what&#39;s coming are not single events but rather whole changes in the way that we handle our economic lives.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s necessary for me to set aside the desire to protect them and educate them instead.

<title>Ignorance and Want</title>
<body>Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.
&amp;ldquo;Spirit! are they yours?&amp;rdquo; Scrooge could say no more.
&amp;ldquo;They are Man&amp;rsquo;s,&amp;rdquo; said the Spirit, looking down upon them. &amp;ldquo;And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.&amp;nbsp; &#45;&amp;nbsp; A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens
These are frightening economic times and the fact that it&#39;s the Christmas season doesn&#39;t make it any less so; in some ways, it makes it even worse.&amp;nbsp; This is the time when kids are supposed to get the gifts for which they ask and when they can tell that things aren&#39;t good &#45; and they aren&#39;t stupid, they know &#45; most parents feel even more pressure to keep Christmas alive for the kids.&amp;nbsp; It hasn&#39;t helped that in the past fifty years, Madison Avenue has had a heyday blurring the lines between wants and needs.&amp;nbsp; Many parents will tilt further giving the kids what they want thinking that that&#39;s what they need to allay the fear of things spiraling out of control.
But Dickens had it correct as the greatest concern is the ignorance of our children.&amp;nbsp; Many parents work to satisfy the wants of the child and some are recognizing the economic necessity and shifting to providing for the needs instead. Many families are caught in the economic bind however as some are un&#45; or underemployed while others are working longer hours to just keep up the status quo.&amp;nbsp; Coming home to a brisk routine of homework/childcare, chores and bedtime leaves many parents perpetually harried and looking for ways to gain a little rest.&amp;nbsp; Understanding that children do create additional time demands and some mayhem, parents let the kids entertain themselves with all manner of electronic devices.&amp;nbsp; We permit them to anesthetize themselves so that we can in turn be anesthetized from the daily grind of life.&amp;nbsp;
So the kids get what they want, but the downside to the barrage of electronics is ignorance.&amp;nbsp; The kids can multitask, download and interact electronically in ways that even many young parents find unimaginable yet they are profoundly ignorant of the actual world around them.&amp;nbsp; They see YouTube videos of accidents that, while funny, inflict injury and aren&#39;t touched or concerned when something happens in front of them.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t learn the everyday mechanisms and procedures of how the world around them works and often with profound effects. While I don&#39;t expect kids to understand the role of a notary public in land records, the ghastly lapses in the Florida and New York foreclosure cases are an adult version of what happens when techno&#45;savants are permitted to monkey with centuries&#45;old systems and policies.&amp;nbsp; Simply put, kids have no clue of how to function in the daily world because the adults aren&#39;t teaching them.
This ignorance &#45; how and why things are the way that they are, how they work and what things really mean &#45; is a profound handicap for a child when he becomes an adult.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that it can only be remedied through intentional and significant time with the parents and away from a screen.&amp;nbsp; A videogame won&#39;t explain why somebody acted in a certain way or why it&#39;s important to know to follow rules or even to be able to lose gracefully.&amp;nbsp; It won&#39;t explain the difference between a playmate and a friend, literally the difference between someone who&#39;ll toss a ball with you and then stab you in the back before the teacher or spread gossip about you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A computer screen won&#39;t teach the physical skills of how to hold a knife or reinforce the need for consistently good manners at the table.&amp;nbsp; All of these things will only come from the parent who is willing to spend the time necessary to bring the child along in the world.&amp;nbsp;
One of a father&#39;s greatest &#45; and most important &#45; jobs is to teach.&amp;nbsp; Yes, the dishes need to be washed and the yard needs to be mowed, but our children need our time and attention even more.&amp;nbsp; Our sons and daughters are our primary responsibility and our greatest gift to them is our time, a phenomenally priceless yet cheap commodity that satisfies both their needs and wants.&amp;nbsp; Take the time to read to them and play with them, incorporate their presence into your activities as much as possible and turn off your own devices when they come to you.&amp;nbsp; You may feel guilty for taking the time to &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; with them, but it&#39;s really your job and an activity that can lead to wildly unimaginable opportunities to teach about any number of topics.&amp;nbsp; The dishes will always need to be washed and the grass will continue to grow, but we only have what is really a very brief time to combat the ignorance that might otherwise dog them later.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, they can&#39;t learn when they spend their time ensconced in front of a screen so make them turn it off.&amp;nbsp;
They might not realize it yet, but it really is what they want.</body>

<title>Must I Really Answer This?&nbsp; Explanations For The Kids</title>
<body>Why must I explain such a simple thing to a kid?&amp;nbsp; He &#45; or she&amp;nbsp;&#45; is no longer a preschooler and some things are simply so self&#45;evident that explanation beggars the imagination.&amp;nbsp; But thanks to the presence of the MRI, which demonstrates how the teen brain is literally rewiring itself during that decade of growth, I can at least convince myself that there&#39;s a legitimate reason to have to explain what is abundantly clear to 98.9% of adults.&amp;nbsp; Our parents simply would shake their heads and weep for America.&amp;nbsp; I now have a greater appreciation for Red Forman of That &#39;70s Show.
What are some of the questions that make me want to honestly plant a foot in someone&#39;s butt?
Question:&amp;nbsp; Why must I use a topsheet when I put clean sheets on my bed?&amp;nbsp; (I&#39;m really okay without them).&amp;nbsp; So that we only have to wash thin sheets made dirty by your body oils and sweat instead of the comforter/quilt/bedspread that can only be done at the laundromat in the commercial washer.
Question:&amp;nbsp; Why can&#39;t I learn to ride a unicycle while riding on a brick retaining wall?&amp;nbsp; So that you don&#39;t really hurt yourself when you fall.&amp;nbsp; But Dad, I won&#39;t fall/get hurt on this unicycle.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s why it&#39;s called an accident.&amp;nbsp; Now get off of the wall.
Question:&amp;nbsp; Why do you care if I go in my bedroom and draw my name on the hardwood floor with permanent marker/shoot Airsoft pellets at the wall/use the wall for knifethrowing target practice/repeatedly throw myself on my old bed when I&#39;m having a tantrum?&amp;nbsp; A, because I said so.&amp;nbsp; B, because you&#39;ll someday move on and I&#39;ll have to fix/repair/paint/clean it to sell this place.&amp;nbsp; C, because I said so.&amp;nbsp; And if you aren&#39;t certain, D, because I can remove everything to prove that it&#39;s really mine.&amp;nbsp; And did I mention because I said so?
PracticalDad note:&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s this preceding question that elicits a Red Formanesque mutterance.
Question:&amp;nbsp; Why can&#39;t my buddy and I stand on opposite sides of the house and shoot arrows over the rooftop at each other?&amp;nbsp; (Silence)
Question:&amp;nbsp; Why can&#39;t I ride the skateboard while hanging onto a moving car?&amp;nbsp; Michael J. Fox did it.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, and unfortunately, Michael J Fox now has Parkinson&#39;s.
Question:&amp;nbsp; Why can&#39;t I play two story bowling with the pins at the bottom of the steps?&amp;nbsp; Just because, son.&amp;nbsp; Just because.
If it appears that these are mostly male&#45;oriented questions, you&#39;re right.&amp;nbsp; Teenage boys are wildly poor at assessing risk but even the teenage girls are notable in their ability to skewer rationality and common sense.
Question:&amp;nbsp; Hey Dad,&amp;nbsp;Junior managed to handcuff himself to the chair without checking to see if there were handcuff keys.&amp;nbsp; Why can&#39;t we tie bows in his hair and put makeup on him?&amp;nbsp; He did it to himself.&amp;nbsp; (Silence)
Many have read the mass email talking about the destructive qualities of small boys and what they can accomplish.&amp;nbsp; It doesn&#39;t go away as they age, but it does change considerably.&amp;nbsp; And for the record, each of these situations that I&#39;ve referenced has really happened although not necessarily with my own kids.&amp;nbsp; But if the incidents aren&#39;t firsthand, they are secondhand &#45; none of them are thirdhand.

<title>Ghost of Christmas Future:&nbsp; UK Tuition Increase</title>
<body>Earlier today, a live BBC news feed showed an English student dressed as Santa being arrested.&amp;nbsp; The arrest arose from the student protest against the UK Parliament&#39;s vote to triple the higher education tuition fees to 9000 Pounds annually, an amount that many students cannot afford.&amp;nbsp; The English youth are rioting because they&#39;ve been taught for decades that the best preparation for a prosperous economic adulthood comes via a college degree, and now their hopes of actually obtaining a degree are moving inversely to their tuition costs.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re not stupid and see the writing on the wall.&amp;nbsp; Precisely what does England make?&amp;nbsp; What do they produce, apart from good soccer teams, BBC America and fearsome hooligans?&amp;nbsp; There will always be a need for good plumbers and craftsman, but not in the scale that would be required to absorb that kind of labor surplus.
This is also a portent of what&#39;s to come as more American states raise their in&#45;state tuitions and higher education is effectively removed from a larger and larger segment of our children.&amp;nbsp;
To be honest, I&#39;m inclined to go ahead and riot with them since some of what ails England ails us as well.</body>

<title>Fathers and Volunteering:&nbsp; Just Do It</title>
<body>As busy as people get, we&#39;ve gone a long way to subcontracting and outsourcing many family functions.&amp;nbsp; Cleaning house, yardwork, food preparation and even aspects of childrearing &#45; apart from daycare, think Gymboree in lieu of the old&#45;fashioned playgroup &#45; have all been privatized as parents seek ways to keep the kids covered while they either work or, in extreme cases, just don&#39;t bother.&amp;nbsp; But there activities that thrive only with the input of volunteers and it&#39;s here that fathers can and must step up, especially scouting and sports.
Through our history, almost everything having to do with the children has been the purview of mothers.&amp;nbsp; But as they&#39;re stretched further with work, other areas have to necessarily suffer and some of the obvious areas, like housework and childcare, have seen fathers step up accordingly.&amp;nbsp; But one of the areas that hasn&#39;t seen as much is volunteering.&amp;nbsp; Men simply aren&#39;t as gifted at multitasking as women, and there&#39;s still considerable fear amongst many guys that they aren&#39;t as good with the kids as women.&amp;nbsp; Men are obviously becoming more comfortable with their own children but that hasn&#39;t always carried over to working with and managing Opies &#45; Other People&#39;s Kids.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is two&#45;fold:

    Many worthwhile activities and organizations simply cannot survive without an active volunteer cadre to carry the load;
    With as many broken families and absentee fathers, there&#39;s a true need for fathers to serve as role models for kids.

The obvious start is to stick with what you know.&amp;nbsp; What sports did you play when you were younger?&amp;nbsp; What were your activities apart from sports, such as scouting or hunting and camping?&amp;nbsp; These kinds of things in and of themselves give you a leg up as a volunteer with kids.&amp;nbsp; My youngest has taken to baseball and it&#39;s fascinating to watch the fathers involved with the teams.&amp;nbsp; While the head coach of his most recent team never played as a kid, he&#39;s&amp;nbsp; comfortable with kids and a number of other fathers &#45; all of whom played &#45; stepped in to assist with the position drills and practices.&amp;nbsp; This goes with whether the sports are for boys or girls as the key is to provide a steady, stable and authoritative presence for the kids.
If you don&#39;t have any particular sporting experience, you can still step up.&amp;nbsp; As I mentioned, Youngest&#39;s baseball coach had no experience as a kid but stepped in when his child was a beginner and learned over the years with his son.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s likewise been the case with my daughter&#39;s soccer teams, many of whom were coached by adults with no real experience.&amp;nbsp; The case of soccer will probably change as time passes as the game becomes&amp;nbsp; more popular and played in this country.&amp;nbsp; Regardless, these are all individuals who started when the kids were little and learned along with them and as is often the case, if you don&#39;t announce that you have no experience, the kids will never know the difference.&amp;nbsp; If the adults can tell the difference and complain, then screw &#39;em &#45; they should be out there doing it instead of grousing about you.
There is one area which makes men uncomfortable &#45; me included &#45; and that pertains to girl scouting.&amp;nbsp; The only time that I&#39;ve declined to become involved is when a desperate scout leader asked if I would be willling to lead a Brownie Troop, and my refusal was on grounds that many parents would be uncomfortable with a man working with little girls.&amp;nbsp; This was borne out by subsequent conversations with female friends whose comments confirmed my suspicions.&amp;nbsp; Both Girl Scouting and Boy Scouting are organizations that have taken the concern for predatory behavior to heart, but there&#39;s still a cultural bias against men taking such an overt role with girls and the Girl Scouting organization itself has established guidelines that highly curtail the interaction of men and girls, such as on camping trips in which any fathers who might choose to come along have to remain a certain distance from the girls&#39; campsite.
This is another aspect that I believe concerns many men, and that&#39;s the worry about whether they&#39;ll be perceived as predators or face accusations of predatory behavior.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a legitimate concern but one that&#39;s easily handled if you exercise some common sense.&amp;nbsp; The Boy Scouts of America require that all leaders take training in their Child Safety Policy and the cornerstone &#45; apart from a mandatory criminal background check &#45; is the practice of the &amp;quot;two deep rule&amp;quot;, where no adult leader can be alone with any youth apart from their child.&amp;nbsp; Any meetings or activities require the presence of at least one other adult at all times and that policy carries through to such simple tasks as picking up a child for a meeting or taking the kid home.&amp;nbsp; On multiple occasions, I&#39;ve demurred from taking another kid to an event as it would violate the rule and the other parents have learned to work around that.
The point is this.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a chronic need and it&#39;s not just for volunteers, but fathers to step in and take a role.&amp;nbsp; Like I said, if you don&#39;t tell the kids, they&#39;ll never know.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll just be glad that you&#39;re there.

<title>Preparing the Kids:&nbsp; Encouraging Skepticism</title>
<body>With kids spending so much time engaged with one form of electronic media or another, I&#39;m honestly concerned about my kids&#39; critical thinking skills.&amp;nbsp; For me, a large part of critical thinking is determining the difference between what&#39;s real and what&#39;s&amp;nbsp;crap and from what I observe, much of what&#39;s presented in the media today is mostly crap.&amp;nbsp; I want my kids to view things with a skeptical eye, asking themselves whether what they&#39;re hearing, viewing and reading makes sense or if it really is nonsense.&amp;nbsp; I want them to question and in light of today&#39;s current events &#45; political figures calling for someone&#39;s assassination and the confluence between business and government &#45; skepticism and critical thought&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;essential.
This isn&#39;t a new goal since I&#39;ve made it a lifetime habit of pulling their legs with nonsense so that they can start to learn to determine the difference between truth and fiction.&amp;nbsp; But the drive is taking on a new impetus as I no longer have any faith in the traditional Main Stream Media (MSM).&amp;nbsp; The good thing is the presence of the internet, which allows a person to dig further.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, the bad thing is the presence of the internet which allows a person to dig further. The key&amp;nbsp;however, is the ability to ascertain&amp;nbsp;whether what&#39;s being presented can stand on its own logic or if it requires further examination and debunking.
Unlike other articles, this one has taken further examination and the language used has changed from the original draft.&amp;nbsp; My initial impetus was to raise kids that willingly question authority, which is radically different coming from a status&#45;quo conservative; both my wife and I were raised in autocratic households and to an extent, ours has been the same.&amp;nbsp; But I know that we have reasons to do things a certain way and it&#39;s frankly sometimes a nuisance&amp;nbsp;to raise kids who start in the&amp;nbsp; home and automatically question&amp;nbsp;everything we do.&amp;nbsp; Learn how to ask properly and I&#39;ll explain it, perhaps even more than once.&amp;nbsp; It occurred to me however, that the key is to raise kids who will think through things first and ascertain whether something indeed needs to be questioned.
So how do I manage to raise skeptics?

    Starting at a young age, pull their legs frequently and then take the opportunity when they bite to examine the information.&amp;nbsp; Can you really milk an alpaca?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s go find out and verify that.&amp;nbsp; Is Morocco really just to the east of Las Vegas?&amp;nbsp; Pull out the atlas and find Las Vegas, and then look to the east.
    Establish some guidelines about the use of electronics and then work to enforce them.&amp;nbsp; Make the kids turn off the screens and spend time in the real world instead of the virtual one.&amp;nbsp; It creates more work for you, but educating the kids is one of a father&#39;s primary functions.
    Take time to discuss issues with them, even if they&#39;re younger.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s certainly a judgment call as to the issues for which they&#39;re ready and expect to draw the occasional blank stare, but you&#39;d be surprised to find out how much&amp;nbsp; the kids are taking in and if they&#39;re taking things in, it&#39;s best that you have a handle on what those things are.
    Try the Socratic Method and ask questions to walk them through an issue.&amp;nbsp; My own father was a master at the Socratic Method and more often than not, my questions only raised other questions back to me.&amp;nbsp; It was a tremendous nuisance &#45; does the old man know anything? &#45; but it did help me learn how to frame questions and give me some sense of how to approach an issue.&amp;nbsp;
    This goes to the next point, which is to be prepared to spend the time to explore their questions with them.&amp;nbsp; Turn off the damned electronics yourself and spend the moments &#45; hell, hours if necessary &#45; to help them gain a grip on the issue.&amp;nbsp; Again, this cuts into your own time but remember Fatherhood&#39;s First Law &#45; your life is no longer your own.
    Avoid overly political labels and try to stick to the salient facts at hand.&amp;nbsp; Is Julian Assange a terrorist and Sarah Palin a fascist? Who says so, and why would they say it?&amp;nbsp; What did these people do anyway?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What exactly is a fascist in the first place?
    Walk with them through the various sources available and critique these sources.&amp;nbsp; I remember learning a dictum in elementary school:&amp;nbsp; the educated person doesn&#39;t know everything, but they know where to go for the information.&amp;nbsp; Help&amp;nbsp; your kids learn the various sources available to them.

This is an ongoing work in progress and I don&#39;t profess to know the answers.&amp;nbsp; But these are all items that I try to keep in mind as the kids grow and raise questions and while it sometimes feels as though I&#39;m beating my head against the wall, there are other moments when I can see the lights starting to turn on.&amp;nbsp; Those are moments that I live for.

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; December 2010 Index Rises to 100.78</title>
<body>Are prices &#45; specifically grocery prices that affect the typical family &#45; rising?&amp;nbsp; Prices for those 46&amp;nbsp;items that comprise the PracticalDad Price Index food basket have been collected for December 2010 and are presented below.&amp;nbsp; There are some comments:

    The final cost of the market basket is based upon the average taken for items from three separate and unrelated grocery stores.&amp;nbsp;
    In the majority of cases, the item size is consistent across all stores.&amp;nbsp; For a very few items however &#45; a box of kitchen trash bags for example &#45; there are three different box sizes and I have recalculated the price to be equivalent to the same size across all three stores.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the trash bags, two stores had their prices recalculated from box sizes of 22 and 20 bags to equivalent costs per box of 26 bags.&amp;nbsp; This methodology was used last month and will used consistently going forward.
    The cost of December&#39;s basket was $179.79 versus November&#39;s basket cost of $178.39 for an increase of $1.40.&amp;nbsp; This is a cumulative monthly price rise of 0.78%, annualized to a rate of 9.42%.
    Using the November basket figures as the baseline of 100, the December results raise the PracticalDad Price Index to 100.78.
    One grocery store provided an example of phantom inflation as the coffee price remained the same ($3.19) but the can size decreased from 13 to 11 oz.&amp;nbsp; I recalculated the price to an equivalent price at 13 oz, which would reflect a price of $3.77; this was an increased coffee price of 18% at that particular store.
    While I expect statistical noise on a monthly basis, I was surprised at the extent of a monthly price rise in two commodity&#45;based items, coffee and aluminum foil.&amp;nbsp; While aluminum foil only rose $.07/75 sq ft roll, this is still an increase of 2.4%, annualized to almost 29%.&amp;nbsp; Both the coffee and the foil are household examples of the effects of excess liquidity sloshing into raw materials and driving up prices for the end consumer.

<title>Monitoring the Movies</title>
<body>My wife and I go particularly out of our way on two items, making sure that the kids feel comfortable enough to have their friends over regularly and also monitoring the electronics.&amp;nbsp; While they seem different enough, last night was a case where they intersected and we had to decide whether the electronic control would damage the kids&#39; willingness to have friends over.&amp;nbsp; Can we be so controlling that the kids will cease having the friends over?
The situation was a gathering last night after the town&#39;s Christmas Tree lighting ceremony, when multiple families and kids descended on a friends home for real hot chocolate and Christmas cookies.&amp;nbsp; Afterwards, five teenage boys &#45; ages 14 through 18 &#45; and a third grader came back to our house for multiple activities.&amp;nbsp; The youngster was spending the night with Youngest while the boys wanted to watch a movie and eat like locusts.&amp;nbsp; The typical chaos reigned as the group entered, settled in and began to pillage the pantry and refrigerator like Vikings at a nobleman&#39;s castle.&amp;nbsp; As we got the younger kids settled, the older ones switched on the television and went to the On&#45;Demand section to peruse and make a selection.&amp;nbsp; When I returned to the kitchen, they had already started The Expendables with Stallone, Willis, Schwarzenegger, etc.&amp;nbsp; The opening sequence of the film was the shoot&#45;&#39;em&#45;up violence of any PG&#45;13 film and I moved on to other tasks, thinking nothing of it until my wife called my attention to a scene in which someone was being waterboarded, to my wife&#39;s horror.&amp;nbsp; One or two questions yielded the information that the film indeed had an R rating, earned for gratuitous violence.&amp;nbsp;
We&#39;ve not only monitored and controlled electronic usage, but we&#39;ve always been strict with the movie rating system and have on any number of occasions shot down a movie request because of the proposed movie&#39;s rating.&amp;nbsp; My wife left the decision on handling it to me and after a short while to think, I left the movie run but joined the kids so that there was indeed parental supervision.&amp;nbsp; The gist of the thought process was that this kind of movie would be seen by any of the others and the concern that if I were to embarass them, the willingness to bring others into the house would falter.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&#39;t a movie that I would&#39;ve permitted them to attend and the boys did get one over on me.&amp;nbsp; After the movie, I spoke to my kids and told them bluntly that any future movies would have to be cleared with me first or else I would end it at that moment, regardless of the embarasssment.
In retrospect, I wish that I had just ended the film then and there.&amp;nbsp; While this wasn&#39;t a situation that demanded immediate action &#45; like drinking, partying or fighting &#45; I should have made the boys toe the line so that they don&#39;t begin to believe that I can be rolled.&amp;nbsp; The kids will sometimes get one over me but it doesn&#39;t mean that I have to accede to the con.</body>

<title>Kids and Chore Charts</title>
<body>As kids grow and are able to take on more responsibility, parents frequently turn to chore charts to help keep things on track.&amp;nbsp; They have multiple advantages. not least of which is helping a frazzled parent keep tabs on what&#39;s been done and who&#39;s responsible for what; I can&#39;t emphasize enough how chaotic things with multiple children can become.</body>

<title>Kid Milestones:&nbsp; The Shotgun Seat</title>
<body>There are milestones in a family&#39;s life and one of them in our family has been the shotgun seat &#45; aka the front passenger seat for the uninformed.&amp;nbsp; With the presence of airbags, kids have had to wait until they were sufficiently old and large enough to withstand the impact of deployment and it was a rite of passage amongst the older ones when they could graduate from the backseat to the shotgun seat.&amp;nbsp; But what do we do when there&#39;s a gray area?
Different states have differing guidelines on when a child is legally allowed to ride shotgun with a front airbag.&amp;nbsp; While the consensus of many is that the child has to be twelve years of age, it does vary.&amp;nbsp; In my instance, our state laws mandate that a child must be at least eight years of age with a minimum height of 4&#39;9&amp;quot; and a weight of 80 lbs.&amp;nbsp; We had previously based our decision with the other two kids on the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which suggested that it&#39;s simply wiser to wait until the child is twelve years of age so that any question of size and weight is moot by that point.&amp;nbsp; That was fine when the two older kids were well within the size guidelines, but Youngest is the Bell Curve outlier in terms of size and weight.&amp;nbsp; He wears clothing sizes that are typically worn by kids in middle school and is far past the front seat parameters set by state law.&amp;nbsp;
When Youngest and I were doing some Christmas shopping on Saturday morning, he asked if he could sit shotgun.&amp;nbsp; Given his size &#45; and the fact that having a kid sit shotgun happily changes the occupant dynamics &#45; I agreed and he jumped into the front at the next stop, with the understanding that I&#39;d check on the requirements when we got home.&amp;nbsp; While he&#39;s well past the state requirements, he doesn&#39;t meet the AAP guidelines of being twelve years of age.&amp;nbsp; But the opposition came from his older siblings who protested based upon the premise that they had to wait and it was only fair that he should as well.&amp;nbsp; The logic that he&#39;s far bigger at his age than they were doesn&#39;t wash with the siblings and I suppose that I can understand why.&amp;nbsp; But as I pointed out to them, it&#39;s not a matter that they weren&#39;t as mature at that age or that I might love him more &#45; it&#39;s the simple reality that he&#39;s simply much, much bigger than they were.
For the record, we&#39;ve decided to follow the AAP guidelines and have him wait until he&#39;s older for the shotgun seat.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve made it clear to all three kids that it&#39;s not due to their protest or their apparent &#45; to Youngest, at least &#45; status as most favored children.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s simply the sense that the pediatricians have more thoroughly studied the issue and find it to be more than simply a matter of size.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve also warned that the next milestone will soon be upon them &#45; when Youngest physically dominates his elder siblings.</body>

<title>What&#8217;s Going On With Ireland And the IMF?</title>
<body>Those who have been reading me awhile know that I&#39;m a closet economics geek.&amp;nbsp; The Chinese aphorism is may you live in interesting times and if they didn&#39;t get so damned scary, it would be utterly fascinating.&amp;nbsp; But the periodic conversation over the past several months has been the game of economic dominoes played first in Greece and most recently in Ireland.&amp;nbsp; Just what is going on in Ireland?&amp;nbsp; What does it mean to my family?
One of the better layman&#39;s explanations of the Irish predicament comes from Gonzalo Lira.&amp;nbsp; I recommend the article in it&#39;s relatively brief entirety as it lays out the core of the problems that now face the Irish.&amp;nbsp;
But what does it mean for my family?&amp;nbsp; The gist is that the Irish backed their failing major banks in their entirety without knowing that the banks had blown such gaping holes in their hulls that they saddled the Irish taxpayer with a ghastly debt burden.&amp;nbsp; What it means for my family is the concept of austerity, in which the national economy goes into literal lifesupport as desperately needed capital is transferred from the taxpayer to support the banks.&amp;nbsp; As the Irish did with their Anglo&#45;Irish Bank, we&#39;ve thrown life support to the TBTF entities so that the typical American family will carry huge tax burdens to cover the cost of that debt.&amp;nbsp; The result will be higher taxation of the general public and greatly constrained public spending as the debt assumed from the financial system crowds out the debt that would be used for real public expenditures, and that was already too high to begin with.
What is frightening is that it truly is a game of economic dominoes.&amp;nbsp; If the poorer European Union nations &#45; the infamous PIIGS &#45; are permitted to flounder and collapse the Euro, then the stronger core European banks holding the PIIGS sovereign debt will fold.&amp;nbsp; If these banks fold or collapse in any way, the interconnectedness with the US TBTF institutions will create stunning pressure on the US financial system with the&amp;nbsp;growing prospect of collapse.
I&#39;m actually sorry that the Irish government caved in and took the IMF/European Central Bank rescue proposal since it ostensibly saves the bank bondholders at the expense of the Irish taxpayers for the next generation (that isn&#39;t an exaggeration, either).&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s once again the bondholder and corporations &#45; one group relatively few in number and the other legally fictitious &#45; that will prosper at the expense of the mass of the taxpayers.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a continuing thread that poses a true threat to my children&#39;s future.</body>

<category>Dad and Mom</category>
<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Are Small Children a Mother&#8217;s Job?</title>
<body>I recently had a series of conversations and the gist was the question of whether fathers had a serious role in raising smaller children or whether small kids are the mother&#39;s purview.&amp;nbsp; The sense of one person was that the father should let the mother be primarily responsible for the younger kids until they&#39;re older, at which point the father steps in.&amp;nbsp; Others disagreed and to be honest, I was surprised.&amp;nbsp; Why shouldn&#39;t the father be involved from the earliest days?
Mothers historically are viewed as the nurturing parent and that&#39;s partially the result of the physical act of having to nurse the child.&amp;nbsp; Both nurture and nurse are from the latin nutrire, of which one definition is to nourish.&amp;nbsp; Prior to formula, and followed later by the breast pump, women had to stay home since they were the only ones capable of actually feeding an infant that wasn&#39;t yet able to take in solid food.&amp;nbsp; And historically, the fathers were out working in order to put the bread on the table and the roof over the head.&amp;nbsp; With these clear job delineations, men looked askance at women as they entered the workplace.&amp;nbsp; I can attest from firsthand experience that when men started to take up the household and childcare duties, more than a few women likewise looked askance as well.
But is that parental job division still valid?&amp;nbsp; Are kids better off with mothers when they&#39;re younger or are men equally as capable?
I&#39;ll have to be honest and acknowledge that at some level, there will be some gender generalizations made.&amp;nbsp; In my experience, women seem naturally more capable of multi&#45;tasking than men and I can&#39;t determine if that&#39;s hard&#45;wired into their brains or just a skill acquired from watching their own mothers as they grew up.&amp;nbsp; Multiple men have commented that their wives are better at handling several things simultaneously but I can attest that there are some learned skills that make the juggling of various tasks at the same time.&amp;nbsp; The more that you handle housework, the more you learn about how to accomplish various tasks while the dishwasher or dryer is running.&amp;nbsp; Most women have also had the opportunity to watch their mothers work with the children and combined with the plethora of additional resources available and are less surprised by the various ways that a child can throw a monkey wrench into the workings of the average day.&amp;nbsp; Men haven&#39;t had the benefit of seeing their fathers in this role before and couple this with the lack of resources and many men are far more unprepared than their mates for the task.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, women tend to be far more detail oriented than men and one of the female&#39;s standard complaints is that the male just isn&#39;t paying attention.
Point taken.&amp;nbsp; But the flip side is that it&#39;s hard to keep track of details when you&#39;ve got no clue what the details even are.&amp;nbsp; Birthday parties, vaccinations and clothing shopping&amp;nbsp;are generally off of the father&#39;s radar but once he&#39;s aware, he can also learn to make sure that they&#39;re covered.
But apart from the inexperience and unfamiliarity factors, fathers are also capable of taking over the childcare and household responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s liable to be a bumpy ride at first, but men can learn the tips, tricks and routines that go into the daily life of the child.&amp;nbsp; What are the child&#39;s sleep and nutritional requirements?&amp;nbsp; Why are they acting as they are and if it&#39;s a problem, what can I do about it?&amp;nbsp; These are issues that don&#39;t lend themselves to any particular gender and with some experience and attention, fathers should be able to handle them as well.&amp;nbsp;
There are some areas of childrearing in which fathers do have an advantage over the women.&amp;nbsp; The communication skills of children with active fathers is significantly higher than those without an active father.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, kids with active fathers are more self&#45;confident in their dealings with new situations and are more willing to explore than if the father isn&#39;t involved or present.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the men who interact in the world and take the time to model that behavior for their children that really are watching what they do.&amp;nbsp;
There&#39;s another aspect to fathers in the home that deals less with the child&#39;s well&#45;being than the father&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps because so many now grow up in fatherless homes that those men who had no active fathers want to take a strong role in the household and childrearing so that their children don&#39;t experience what they did.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had multiple conversations with men over the years and the common thread of these fatherless guys is that they want the kids to not experience their own difficulties.&amp;nbsp; They also want to enjoy their time with the kids, far more than their predecessors did.&amp;nbsp; Solid parent&#45;child relationships are built on more than just weekend trips to the zoo or other activities and it&#39;s in the day&#45;to&#45;day life that many lessons are passed along.
But for all intents and purposes, it&#39;s become a more academic question than it was one or two decades ago.&amp;nbsp; The old gender lines are blurring and as they continue, because of economics and choice, it will be less of a concern to the simple question of who&#39;s making sure that the kids are cared for and raised.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Just What Is A Gold Standard?</title>
<body>Listen to AM talk radio nowadays and you&#39;ll hear hosts rave on about the value of gold in your portfolio.&amp;nbsp; I buy it and you should too.&amp;nbsp; Protection in the face of a declining dollar.&amp;nbsp; Buy now and don&#39;t be priced out.&amp;nbsp; Most people can see the value to purchasing precious metals in today&#39;s financial environment but now pundits are tossing around &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; like a football and you have to question, what is a gold standard and what does it mean?
To understand the gold standard, you first have to understand that we live with a fiat currency&amp;nbsp;monetary system.&amp;nbsp; Excepting those countries who tie their currency to the value of another&#39;s currency &#45; think China and the United States &#45; currencies &amp;quot;float&amp;quot; in value versus one another and it&#39;s the collective global concensus that evaluates which countries have stronger currencies.&amp;nbsp; There is nothing backing any currency except for the economic policies and tax revenues of that nation.&amp;nbsp; The Norwegian Kroner &#45; remember that Norway is not a part of the Euro &#45; represents a nation that&#39;s the #3 oil producer in the world, started the world&#39;s first Sovereign Wealth Fund to cushion against the day that the North Sea oil runs out, and keeps it&#39;s public debt under control.&amp;nbsp; Now consider the Mexican Peso.&amp;nbsp; The country is in year three of a vicious fight against drug lords, has a depleting oil supply and never fully recovered from the currency crisis of the 1990s.&amp;nbsp; When the global currency market considers these factors, it values the Kroner higher against the peso so that it takes far more pesos to purchase one kroner.&amp;nbsp; If the Mexicans could magically deport the drug lords to Norway, find another huge oil field and the Norwegians shot through five years of oil revenues on a month&#45;long binge of hookers and blow, then the world will re&#45;evaluate the peso as worth far more than the kroner.&amp;nbsp; Not that the typical Norwegian male would be in any condition to care.
Cut through the mustard and that&#39;s about where it comes down.
Countries compete against each other in multiple ways but one of the long&#45;term keys is via national interest rates, as set by both the particular central bank and the assessment of the global investment community.&amp;nbsp; In the ideal world, interest rates supposedly act as a crude governor to the economic engine so when things start to heat up, the national rates are raised, credit demand declines and things slow down.&amp;nbsp; When things are slow, rates are dropped and credit is more available so that things pick up.&amp;nbsp; The market also has an impact on rates however via a risk premium on top of the set national rate.&amp;nbsp; When things are copacetic and the investment assessment actually matches reality, the risk premium is small and other factors are allowed to help set a country&#39;s course.&amp;nbsp; When things aren&#39;t copacetic however, then the risk premium rises so that a country has to pay far more for capital than others.&amp;nbsp;
In today&#39;s world, we&#39;re awash with debt at all levels &#45; personal, municipal, state, national (sovereign).&amp;nbsp; Because we&#39;re a fiat currency, the only way to handle governmental debt is to either raise taxes on a strapped citizenry or else cut spending.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that our political leaders haven&#39;t been willing or able to cut spending and raising taxes isn&#39;t seen as an option.&amp;nbsp; Our monetary authorities &#45; the Federal Reserve System &#45; have opted to address the debt by devaluing the currency.&amp;nbsp; This has been done by keeping interest rates at historic lows for long periods of time and also by purchasing lousy assets from the banks at rates that are far better than the underlying asset is worth. The end result is that huge amounts of liquidity have been injected into the system and at this moment, there&#39;s no evidence that that&#39;s going to be brought under control.&amp;nbsp; The long and short is that the political and financial classes appear to have lost the will to do what&#39;s in the best interest of the country, assuming that we could all agree on the definition of &amp;quot;best interest&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s this sense that certain members of the financial and political community &#45; both in and out of the US &#45; can&#39;t be counted on to control themselves that&#39;s led to the rising talk of a return to the gold standard.&amp;nbsp; When countries agreed to operate on a gold standard &#45; whose best days were from about 1880 to 1914 &#45; the operation was almost mechanical.&amp;nbsp; In a sense, each country&#39;s bank vault was akin to a giant bucket and international trade was the liquid that flowed between the various buckets.&amp;nbsp; When a bucket became too full, the country took the currencies filling it to the various currency owners and turned them in for gold to fill the national bullion vault.&amp;nbsp; Because the amount of a country&#39;s money circulating was a function of the amount of gold in the vaults, more gold led to easier credit and more money circulating.&amp;nbsp; Those with less gold had tighter credit and higher interest rates until such a time as they adjusted their policies enough to balance the system so that increased trade brought gold back to their own vaults.&amp;nbsp;
In a way, the system was self&#45;regulating amongst the countries and eliminated the vagaries that arose from the decisions of individuals regarding their particular currencies.&amp;nbsp; It was consequently a mechanism that imposed discipline among the member nations so that no one country could run chronic trade and budget deficits or debase their currency.&amp;nbsp;
That&#39;s the theory behind the argument on behalf of a gold standard and the reason that more voices, domestically and internationally, are being raised.&amp;nbsp; Just bear in mind that there&#39;s no such thing as a hands&#45;off mechanism that&#39;s flawless when it comes to the interactions and foibles of people.

<title>Is Inflation Happening Now?&nbsp; Walmart Says&#8230;</title>
<body>Yes.
The hope and aim of the Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, is that all of the liquidity that&#39;s being injected into the system will cause prices to rise as inflation takes hold.&amp;nbsp; The fear of many is that he&#39;ll succeed and the general public is now catching up with the econophiles as they try to determine if this is going to happen.&amp;nbsp; After hearing friends comment about how this or that went up in price, I went ahead and started the PracticalDad Price Index&amp;nbsp;to publicly follow the course of prices amongst a market basket of 47 items.
It seems that Walmart has been keeping its own internal survey of about 86 items and the Walmart purchasers are expecting prices to rise in the coming months.&amp;nbsp; Apart from the intellectual exercise of trying to stretch the family dollar even further, people should be concerned because these prices will be concentrated amongst the major producers of items that are composed of commodities such as wheat and sugar.&amp;nbsp; These are precisely the commodity items that have been the recipients of a significant portion of the funds that the Fed has injected into the economy via the financial system.&amp;nbsp; As quantitative easing&amp;nbsp;kicks in over the coming months, more funds will be funneled by the financial sector to commodities that in turn sends the price up further.&amp;nbsp;
If I read the article correctly, the prices haven&#39;t actually hit the shelves yet so shoppers are safe.&amp;nbsp; But they&#39;re coming and we&#39;ll be following them publicly on a monthly basis.
Stay tuned.</body>

<title>Veterans Day, 2010</title>
<body>Each Veterans Day, I think of my deceased father and the stories that I later learned of his service in the Korean War.&amp;nbsp; But this Veterans Day, I&#39;ve been thinking more about my grandfather, the man who watched his son march off to Korea.&amp;nbsp; How must it have felt knowing that your son was enlisting with the prospect of combat and then knowing that he was engaged in combat?
Children grow up and we expect them to talk about the future and what they plan to do.&amp;nbsp; But as I walked the dog with my eldest son the other evening, the discussion turned to life after high school.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s not yet in high school but watches Eldest with the typical high school decisions &#45; where do I want to attend and what do I wish to study?&amp;nbsp; My son &#45; whom I refer to as&amp;nbsp;Middle &#45; struck me with a serious comment about serving his country and&amp;nbsp;his thought of enlisting after graduation.&amp;nbsp; This wasn&#39;t the tone of the kid saying that he wanted to&amp;nbsp;be a soldier when he grew up, but the tone of someone who&#39;s actually giving it consideration.&amp;nbsp; My question was simple:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Why do you want to serve?&amp;nbsp; His response was equally&amp;nbsp;simple:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because I want to make a difference and know that what I did meant something besides just a job.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I honestly felt as though one half of my heart was being torn from the other.&amp;nbsp; This is what I want from my children, the willingness and ability to lead productive and fulfilling lives.&amp;nbsp; I can&#39;t give them happiness since that&#39;s something that they must find for themselves, from within.&amp;nbsp; But the other half was the fear that I suddenly realized, in an intense fashion, is felt by millions of other fathers as they worry about their sons and daughters.&amp;nbsp; Before this moment, it had occurred to me as an intellectual awareness that maybe my child would become a soldier but now it struck me viscerally.&amp;nbsp; We talked and he then asked me what I thought of that prospect.&amp;nbsp; Both of our families &#45; maternal and paternal &#45; are shot through with veterans, although my wife&#39;s tends to the Navy while mine tends to the Army &#45; and the kids know at least some of the stories that have been handed down.&amp;nbsp; God knows that awareness shot through me as we walked.
I struggled with my thoughts and responded simply.&amp;nbsp; I told him that it was an honorable wish and certainly an honorable way to gain that wish, and God knows we need solid, dependable people in the Army.&amp;nbsp; But the reality of what truly bothered me quickly became clear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s not that the Army or Air Force isn&#39;t worthwhile, because it is.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s bothering me is that you might have to risk your life and I want &#45; need &#45; to be sure that the people making the decisions about going to war are truly able to make a good decision that&#39;s worth the sacrifice.&amp;nbsp; And I&#39;m no longer certain that they&#39;re either competent or honest enough to make a solid decision.
That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been thinking of my grandfather the past two days.&amp;nbsp; None of us wish to see our children in danger but the large majority understand that there&#39;s a real need for those able and willing to serve.&amp;nbsp; My grandfather however, had Truman as a president and a Congress that believed that division ended at the water&#39;s edge.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m honestly not the least bit confident in the political leaders, either in their decisions or their loyalties.&amp;nbsp; Who do they serve?&amp;nbsp; The people that elected them, or a corporation that&#39;s purchased their vote for an issue that&#39;s unfriendly to the common man?&amp;nbsp; If my son and his friends are someday&amp;nbsp;in Harm&#39;s Way, I need to know that they&#39;re there for the reasons that idealistic young join &#45; serve, protect and make a difference.
I hope that I haven&#39;t offended anyone reading this and I mean no disrespect to those who served.&amp;nbsp; Now that it&#39;s off of my chest, I&#39;m going to have a drink and have a few thoughts of my own father, the veteran.
Good night and thank you for your service.
&amp;nbsp;

This came from one the kids who arrived home from school to find the bedroom door open.&amp;nbsp; And it begs the question, just whose room is it, really?
Teens are acutely aware of their privacy, especially as their bodies change and they become more aware of their privacy.&amp;nbsp; I get that and recall the days of walking in my bedroom, shutting the door, turning on the music and turning off the world.&amp;nbsp; While it appears to be lazy &#45; especially as I wander through carrying laundry or stuff &#45; it does serve a purpose.&amp;nbsp; That however, is a different article for a different day.
The question arises because of what occurs behind the doors, at least in terms of unacceptable behavior.&amp;nbsp; Yes, I also know about self&#45;stimulation and unless it appears to take center stage in life, my view is that it&#39;s normal sexual development for teens.&amp;nbsp; But unacceptable behavior in this instance pertains to actions which damage the property.&amp;nbsp; I know one family whose son had an Air&#45;Soft gun, a high&#45;pressure air gun that can shoot plastic pellets at a high rate of speed, and he&#39;d periodically load up the gun and shoot the walls of the room.&amp;nbsp; Did it knock holes in the walls?&amp;nbsp; No, but it did leave the walls with an interesting dimpled effect from the high&#45;pressure impact.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a conversation that I&#39;ve had on multiple occasions with one of the kids as I&#39;ve had to (re)explain my stance.

    I reserve the right&amp;nbsp;to open up the room when the child&#39;s not around to permit air to flow and stuffiness to dissipate.&amp;nbsp; Teenagers&#39; rooms can get rank in a New York minute if permitted.&amp;nbsp; When the kid gets home and chooses to shut the door, I&#39;ll honor that.
    If damage occurs within the room &#45; and I mean the damage that arise from brain&#45;dead anarchy &#45; then the door will stay open as the child has shown himself incapable of behaving in such a way as to deserve privacy.&amp;nbsp; Sorry, but the Justices don&#39;t live under my roof.&amp;nbsp; It might be your room, but it exists inside of my house and will revert back to me when you&#39;ve grown and moved on.
    Privacy is also a&amp;nbsp;privilege that can be removed in the event of outside misbehavior so egregious that it warrants it.&amp;nbsp; And there have been instances in our household when the bedroom doors have been removed because of major&#45;league issues.&amp;nbsp; While we sometimes permit the kids to earn back removed privileges &#45; note that I didn&#39;t say&amp;nbsp;rights &#45; the loss&amp;nbsp;of privacy is something that we&#39;ve let run the full course.
    I periodically make the statement that I reserve the right to search a room if I deem necessary.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know that that will occur but I don&#39;t want the kids to claim that they were ever unaware that it could occur.
    To the extent that it&#39;s possible, any damage within the room will be fixed or cleaned up by the offending child.&amp;nbsp; That includes scrubbing the floor and spackling and painting damaged walls.&amp;nbsp; I can talk until I&#39;m blue in the face but having to sand a recently spackled wall will send a memorable message &#45; and teach the kid another life skill.

The last point that I&#39;ve occasionally had to make, especially as the kid ages and matures, is whether they&#39;d like someone to treat their property as they might have treated mine.&amp;nbsp; Some kids will never quite understand the point, but others will and amend their ways accordingly.
And to finally prove the point, not only do I open the door to the bedroom but I even open the window.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; November 2010</title>
<body>Because there are questions as to whether inflation is really going to accelerate, I began a simple price index &#45; the&amp;nbsp;PracticalDad Index &#45; &amp;nbsp;with the market basket priced at three local and unrelated grocery stores.&amp;nbsp; The basket consisted of 47 items covering basic food categories such as dairy, meat, produce, staples, baby items and health/beauty products.&amp;nbsp; The pricing will occur during the first several days of each month and the results posted during the second week.
Listed below are the items, with store and average prices, that compose the market basket.&amp;nbsp; The average cost of the basket is $178.39 with a basket range from $174.37 to $181.42 and whenever possible, the items sampled were store brand.

<title>Is Inflation Happening Now?</title>
<body>Now that we&#39;re cruising aboard the QE2, everybody wonders whether we&#39;ll reach the promised destination of a return to economic normality.&amp;nbsp; The cost of this return however, is the value of the dollar and whether we&#39;ll be able to afford anything at all after we&#39;re done.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been growing concern about the validity of the economic data coming from the Federal Government, especially in terms of consumer prices.&amp;nbsp; The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at all&#45;time lows under the mantra that the Consumer Price Index is .1%, exclusive of food and energy.&amp;nbsp; Apparently the Fed believes that the rest of us don&#39;t eat and don&#39;t have to buy gas, so we can stay home on our extreme diets.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve heard people say that food prices are rising, and I believe that they will if they aren&#39;t already, but nobody can seem to say how much.
So we&#39;re going to put it to the test and track the prices of commonly used household items in the PracticalDad BOG (Boots on the Ground) Index.&amp;nbsp; The BOG Index will measure, monthly, the prices of selected grocery items in a&amp;nbsp; simple, straightforward format.&amp;nbsp; What do we actually buy and what&#39;s happening to the price?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s actually not difficult to do provided that you have some rules in place at the outset and then follow them scrupulously; the key is to keep it simple and consistent.
B(oots) O(n the) G(round) Index Rules

    The Index will be calculated by following prices on a monthly basis at three different grocery stores in my vicinity.&amp;nbsp; These stores comprise a mix:&amp;nbsp; a locally owned grocery; an American owned Grocery chain store; an internationally owned grocery chain store.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t pretend that there aren&#39;t regional differences but we&#39;re looking at the price changes in totality, not pricing by region.
    The items are those that would be purchased by a family with children.&amp;nbsp; The item list will not change and the items will be consistent from store to store in package size and comparability.&amp;nbsp; A five pound package of ground round (80% lean) will be the same item priced at each of the three stores.&amp;nbsp; If an item is no longer available at one of the stores, then the best&#45;fit alternative will be used.
    Because one of the concerns about pricing is &amp;quot;stealth inflation&amp;quot;, in which prices remain the same but package size changes, the package size of each item will be consistent.&amp;nbsp; In the event that the package size of an item changes, I will adjust the price recorded to reflect the change by recalculating the item on a per ounce basis.&amp;nbsp; This will then be carried forward as we move along.
    If the stores do not have identically sized packaging for the item in question, the price for the item will be calculated at the base unit price (per ounce, per count, etc.) and equalized amongst the three in a common size.
    Pricing will not allow for BOGO or other such specials&amp;nbsp;so that price movements aren&#39;t distorted.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Likewise, there will be no allowance for coupons.
    As much as practicable, the BOG Index will concentrate on generic&amp;nbsp;items.&amp;nbsp; If generic items aren&#39;t available, such as diapers, then&amp;nbsp;a brand name will be used.
    Pricing will always occur&amp;nbsp;during the first week of&amp;nbsp;each month and the prices as of&amp;nbsp;November 2010 will constitute the base level of 100.&amp;nbsp;

It&#39;s going to be a work in progress but with a little time, the question of whether there&#39;s price inflation &#45; and the extent to which it exists &#45; will become apparent.&amp;nbsp;
The results of this month will be posted next week.</body>

<title>A Family Cruise on the QE2</title>
<body>Several decades ago, a family cruise on the QE2 was an event to be remembered and cherished.&amp;nbsp; Passage was booked well in advance in order to secure a cabin and it was sufficiently expensive that only the wealthier families could afford the trip.&amp;nbsp; But now, millions of American families &#45; the great majority of whom wouldn&#39;t go because the expense &#45;&amp;nbsp;will most likely be&amp;nbsp;peremptorily booked on a new QE2 adventure courtesy of the Federal Reserve System.&amp;nbsp; The excursion&#39;s cost will be ruinously expensive and for most families, savings will be wiped out long before the cruise is finished.&amp;nbsp; The only question is whether the soon&#45;to&#45;be&#45;destitute will be jettisoned before the cruise ends.
Most older Americans identify QE2 as the famous Queen Elizabeth 2, symbol of a slower, more gracious age.&amp;nbsp; But the liner is now long out of service and the QE2 being referenced is what economists and business pundits call Quantitative Easing.&amp;nbsp; Because it&#39;s a repeat of what the Federal Reserve System did two years&amp;nbsp;ago&amp;nbsp;with massive infusions of cash to the financial sector, it&#39;s referred to as QE2.&amp;nbsp; With an economy loaded past the gunwales with debt, more than can be adequately serviced, the value of various asset classes have been dropping steadily for more than two years with a resultant wipeout of trillions of dollars in wealth &#45; paper though it may be.&amp;nbsp; The intent of the experts at the Fed is to actually purchase huge amounts of various kinds of assets from holding banks and institutions, with the institutions and banks subsequently creating additional credit as the funds ripple from the financial sector throughout the economy.&amp;nbsp; These assets will go beyond just the debt to be issued by our Federal government &#45; the government actually only needs a fraction of what&#39;s expected to come &#45; and leech into other areas as well; this would possibly include corporate and municipal bonds and if they emulate Japan&#39;s central bank, could even include ETFs and Real Estate Investment Trusts.&amp;nbsp;
That&#39;s the intent and as the maxim goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.&amp;nbsp; The reality is different.&amp;nbsp; Since that time and despite all of the money pushed to the banks, credit available to the average consumer and small business has dropped, while the reserves held by the banking system has risen multi&#45;fold.&amp;nbsp; Since short&#45;term consumer debt rates &#45; think credit cards &#45; have never been decreased to Joe Six&#45;Pack and credit limits for many have actually been slashed, the response has been to steadily pay off debt as much as possible so that the family debt load is lessened.&amp;nbsp; What has surprised financial authorities is that people in general have made greater efforts to stay current on the credit cards while letting the house payments fall behind; given that many now depend upon the credit card for essentials, this isn&#39;t surprising.&amp;nbsp; And this is where Joe Six&#45;Pack&#39;s actions contribute to the Fed decision to launch the QE2 since many of the deteriorating financial assets are bonds backed by the mortgages that Joe&#39;s letting slip away.
That&#39;s hopefully a nice explanation, but what does it mean for me and my family?&amp;nbsp; How will it impact my kids?&amp;nbsp;
Let&#39;s start by considering the banks.&amp;nbsp; If the banking system is getting all of these funds &#45; and stands to get hundreds of billions more commencing shortly &#45; but isn&#39;t passing them through to everyone else,&amp;nbsp;where is the money going?&amp;nbsp; Banks exist first and foremost as for&#45;profit enterprises with the intent of making money.&amp;nbsp; If they can gain money by selling dodgy assets to or borrowing from the Fed at almost 0% rates, then they can take the almost free money and literally throw it at various investments; if everyone is throwing money at the same assets, the result is that the price is bid up and the asset becomes more expensive.&amp;nbsp; In this instance, the assets at which they&#39;re throwing the money are commodities and natural resources, assets that have a hard, tangible output and value.&amp;nbsp; Remember that ours is a fiat currency&amp;nbsp;backed solely by the tax receipts of our country.&amp;nbsp; Bankers fully understand the concept of debt service and asset valuation and sense that&amp;nbsp;our country has entered a phase in which the ability to cover our debt is seriously questionable.&amp;nbsp; In a grotesquely perverse act of selfishness, they&#39;re taking the money that flows from the increased debt and using it to profit by pushing up the prices of the resources of families and children need to survive &#45; wheat for flour, sugar, corn for food and animal feed, cotton, oil.&amp;nbsp; The prices of these items will continue to rise out of proportion as the money released by QE2 flows further into commodities.
The result will be what the Federal Reserve wishes, inflation.&amp;nbsp; Inflation which not only profits the financial institutions via commodity investment, but also inflation which&amp;nbsp;supposedly makes the country more competitive internationally&amp;nbsp; as the dollar is devalued and the cost of American labor decreases.&amp;nbsp; Joe Six&#45;Pack will be making less, when he&#39;s employed, but will have to stretch the dollars to cover the cost of everyday items needed for his family&#39;s survival.&amp;nbsp; So what might we expect to see for the American family?

    First, the birth rate will drop as fewer couples feel secure enough to take on the cost of raising a child.&amp;nbsp; Already, the US marriage rate is dropping&amp;nbsp;as couples forego marriage until employment prospects improve and while marriage is no longer an automatic precursor to parenthood, many will avoid purposefully having children.
    Second, there will be a continuing swell of the food support programs such as SNAP and WIC.&amp;nbsp;
    Third, school attendance rates will continue strong and lunch program participation will&amp;nbsp;rise.&amp;nbsp; Children who haven&#39;t enough to eat at home will be sent by parents in order to take advantage of subsidized and free meals and more of the three squares a day will come from the school districts.&amp;nbsp; God knows where that money will come from when the Federal Government is eventually forced to pare down spending.
    Fourth, more men will take to the road for employment opportunities a la the Great Depression, further removing fathers from a frayed family structure and placing more stress on the family.
    Fifth, the American retailing model will take a hit as a devalued dollar leads to higher finished goods prices.&amp;nbsp; Even the made&#45;in&#45;China clothing of Wal&#45;mart will become more expensive and out of the reach of stretched families.&amp;nbsp; Clothing will increasingly be purchased or obtained via alternative sources as parents scramble to clothe growing children at church thrift shops, second&#45;hand/consignment shops or even clothing distribution events.&amp;nbsp; In my small town, a reasonably prosperous school district sponsored a free clothing give&#45;away for all ages on a recent Saturday morning.&amp;nbsp; In the longer term, expect handy skills such as sewing to make a comeback.
    Sixth, expect families to take a greater hand in their own food growing, storage and preparation.&amp;nbsp; If food prices rise, more will return to gardening and the subsequent canning/drying.&amp;nbsp; In my own case, I&#39;ve begun the process of turning a manicured hillside ornamental garden into a terraced vegetable garden.&amp;nbsp; I was also surprised to find that a daily chore performed by one of the third&#45;graders in my cub scout den is to feed the chickens.&amp;nbsp; This child leaves in a classic suburban housing development built in the 1970s and the parents, both employed, built a chicken coop in the backyard to cut down on food costs.
    Seventh, anticipate an uptick in juvenile crime and violence.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve raised our children permissively and tended to spoil them and the resulting cut&#45;off of the various goodies will probably lead to some level of increased thefts and violence as they steal from one another as well as others.
    Eighth, expect that the standard housing arrangements will change as families move in&amp;nbsp;with one another to keep costs down and still provide housing for the chlldren.&amp;nbsp; Children might also be&amp;nbsp;more likely to share bedrooms as well as electronic devices within the household.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
    Ninth, expect that in the longer&#45;term, today&#39;s children become far more practical and&amp;nbsp;hardnosed than we &#45; their&amp;nbsp;parents &#45; &amp;nbsp;ever had to be.&amp;nbsp; I glimpsed this one day while talking with one of my&amp;nbsp;son&#39;s friends, who was then in sixth grade.&amp;nbsp; His parents were delighted to be going on a&amp;nbsp;trip to the Bahamas and when&amp;nbsp;I asked about it, he responded&amp;nbsp;The Bahamas?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I want them to&amp;nbsp;get a new driveway.&amp;nbsp; Ours&amp;nbsp;is a wreck.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, I spoke with a teenager&amp;nbsp;who was being raised by his older sister.&amp;nbsp; We were discussing money with a group of teens and&amp;nbsp;the question was what would each do with a windfall of $100,000.&amp;nbsp; While others talked of cars&amp;nbsp;or trips, this boy simply&amp;nbsp;said that he wanted to purchase health insurance and&amp;nbsp;set aside the rest for a place of his own.

There&#39;s no guarantee that any of these will come true,&amp;nbsp;but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them didn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; Some of them are already&amp;nbsp;happening and&amp;nbsp;doing so&amp;nbsp;before my eyes.
We parents are going to be stretched in ways that we never considered&amp;nbsp;before.&amp;nbsp; Our priorities will change and we&#39;ll be forced to make choices and decisions that are new and painful to our generation.&amp;nbsp; The key will be to absorb the blows in such a&amp;nbsp;way that even while our children have to&amp;nbsp;adapt to a new&amp;nbsp;reality, they don&#39;t find it as painful as we&amp;nbsp;will.

<title>Voting and the Kids</title>
<body>Today&#39;s election day across the country and I&#39;m faced with the choice of not only the candidates for the various offices &#45; and trust me, I&#39;m not thrilled about the various options &#45; but which kid goes with me to vote.&amp;nbsp;
It was easier when the kids were very little since my wife and I would trade off.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;d vote in the morning or after work and I&#39;d go in the evening after she&#39;d returned to watch the kids.&amp;nbsp; But they&#39;re older now and while Eldest could watch Youngest, Eldest and Middle also need to see the process in action.&amp;nbsp; The problem is that under our voting laws, I&#39;m only allowed to take one minor into the voting booth with me while the other stands around outside and twiddles the proverbial thumb.&amp;nbsp; Each is old enough to understand not only the process but also some of the issues in varying degree and I expect that it will ultimately come down to a coin toss.
The other issue that I have with voting in this election, far more than in previous elections, is that I&#39;m frankly disgusted both with the slates of candidates offered by both parties as well as the campaign system in general.&amp;nbsp; I recall my parents bitching about the various politicians when I was younger, but they at least perceived that there were other choices and there really was a better candidate.&amp;nbsp; The message that I got was that the system worked and if one did sufficient research, one could actually find the best candidate for the post.&amp;nbsp; But today, I look at the candidates and I see political hacks of all stripes whose sole preoccupation upon entering office is to hang onto the gravy train.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, much of the political power in the country has shifted to the corporations and financial sector.&amp;nbsp; I might never get my congressman to personally take my call but a multinational corporation with sufficient resources will have his attention in a New York minute.&amp;nbsp;
That means that I have to monitor my disgust and try to keep some kind of balance when I&#39;m talking about the political process with the kids.&amp;nbsp; While I&#39;m jaded at the moment, a part of me believes that it is a civic duty and hopes that there will be time that the pendulum has swung back and there really are alternatives.&amp;nbsp; I consequently have to try not to ruin youthful optimism for fear that when the moment arrives, they&#39;ll have opted out of the political process in despair.&amp;nbsp; While I can recall my father excoriate a particular candidate, I never heard him excoriate the entire group of candidates as I&#39;m wont to do inside my head.
So when I enter the voting booth with one of the kids, I&#39;ll try to make sure that I refer to a particular candidate as a lying sack of @#$% instead of all of them as lying sacks of @#$%.&amp;nbsp;
And I promise not to hold my nose while I vote, either.</body>

<title>Cleaning Up:&nbsp; Where Do I Begin?</title>
<body>Kids are time&#45;intensive.&amp;nbsp; When they&#39;re young, you spend your time cleaning up the personal messes and keeping them on track.&amp;nbsp; When they&#39;re older, they can handle their own bodily functions but they still generate messes and dirty laundry like the Dallas Cowboys generate hatred in Philly.&amp;nbsp; Couple that with the various activities and there are weeks when the household work takes a back seat.&amp;nbsp; This weekend culminated in a spate of soccer tournaments, scouting and youth activities and I awoke this morning to a household that&#39;s adrift with debris.&amp;nbsp; Throw in a website that&#39;s behind on posts and a spouse who&#39;s work has taken her out for the better half of the month and things really are in chaos.&amp;nbsp; What can I do to effectively bring things back under control?
There are certain things that I&#39;ve had to learn.

    Take a few moments to lay out a plan on what has to be done.&amp;nbsp; On this particular day, I know that I need to pay attention to the website as well as do laundry and prepare a family dinner for about 5:30 this afternoon.&amp;nbsp; While the laundry is going, what else can I do?&amp;nbsp;
    Multi&#45;tasking.&amp;nbsp; Women really are better at multi&#45;tasking than men but one can learn through time.&amp;nbsp; Devices such as washing machines and dishwashers are labor&#45;saving after they&#39;re loaded, so take the time to get them moving first and then move onto other tasks while they&#39;re going.&amp;nbsp; Sorting laundry is time&#45;consuming but once a load is going, I can move onto other items.
    Understand that multi&#45;tasking will generate chaos as piles of clothes await their turn.&amp;nbsp; Also understand that I&#39;m not going to be able to handle any task to completion before moving on to the next item, as most men like to do.
    Take a moment to think after shifting to a new task.&amp;nbsp; In my case, this is my second effort at this article.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve already done several loads of laundry and cleaned the kitchen while returning to the laptop to write new bullet points and I didn&#39;t take the time to remember that the posting software won&#39;t&amp;nbsp;hold the work for more than an hour&amp;nbsp; unless I remember to periodically save the writing.&amp;nbsp; So an article that was more than three quarters complete was lost and I&#39;m now on the second take.
    Think about what tasks can be passed off to the children.&amp;nbsp; Part of growing up is learning to care for things and that includes such household tasks as bathrooms, dusting and vacuuming.&amp;nbsp; The trade&#45;off is that I might not have it done exactly the way that I&#39;d do it, but it&#39;s still done and they&#39;ve contributed.
    Look for little things to physically carry with me as I move from one part of the house to another.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m presently sitting at the dining room table and noting that Youngest&#39;s toys are clustered on the living room sofa instead of the family room while Eldest&#39;s shoes are at the base of the steps.&amp;nbsp; When I leave this spot, I&#39;ll take the toys to the family room &#45; which adjoins the laundry &#45; and then take the shoes upstairs when I next go upstairs.&amp;nbsp; I could wait for the kids to come home, but the reality is that kids and teens have wildly short attention spans and it&#39;s immensely frustrating to constantly remind them to take this or carry that.&amp;nbsp; This is definitely a case of picking the battles since I&#39;d rather have them spend the time handling the bathroom and dusting.
    Re&#45;evaluate the plan through the course of the day.&amp;nbsp; Kids get sick or other issues arise that require time and attention and it&#39;s frustrating to get to the end of the day and not have accomplished what you wanted.&amp;nbsp;

Finally, I&#39;ve had to learn that these tasks and chores are a process instead of singular tasks or projects that can be completed, like a wood project or car repair.&amp;nbsp; That change in mindset will make the work infinitely more acceptable.</body>

Again, thank you for being one of those who subscribed via RSS.&amp;nbsp;
And you&#39;re now witnessing what happens when one tries to multitask with a young one at the table doing homework, since I goofed and omitted my contact address:
If you do want to drop me a brief note with some suggestions as to what to see or delete in the future, I can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)

<title>RSS At 10,000</title>
<body>People that have their own websites can be caught up in numbers.&amp;nbsp; How many hits?&amp;nbsp; How many unique visitors?&amp;nbsp; From where are they accessing the site &#45; via search engine or link to somebody else?&amp;nbsp; Honestly, I&#39;ve never paid a great deal of attention to the data which is why PracticalDad is a relatively stripped down, no&#45;frills site.&amp;nbsp; Parents &#45; fathers and mothers &#45; aren&#39;t going to read this site because I toss in an article about which is the best family minivan; there are other and better sites for that and I&#39;m not going to spend my time playing Can You Top This?&amp;nbsp; But what has become my focus is the RSS Feed and it was this weekend that the RSS feed clicked over the 10k mark.
Thank you.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, thank you very much for giving enough of a damn to put this site on your RSS feed.&amp;nbsp;
But now I&#39;m going to ask for some input from you, if you could kindly spare me a few moments.&amp;nbsp;
Should I just keep plugging as I&#39;ve been or are there some changes that you&#39;d like to see?&amp;nbsp; More importantly, are there areas on which I need to provide greater &#45; or lesser &#45; focus?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not hiring a market research firm to handle data collection since this is effectively a kitchen table endeavor, but I&#39;d appreciate knowing, and if I don&#39;t get 10,000 responses, then I&#39;ll try to respond to as many as I can.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t want to respond or have nothing to add, then that&#39;s fine, too.
And in the meantime, I&#39;ll continue to roll on as I have, writing for the site in between hauling the kids and managing the family affairs.

<title>Maintaining Control:&nbsp; Riling Up The Kids</title>
<body>Most fathers understand that it&#39;s fun to mess with the kids and rile them up, but yea verily, for everything there is a season and right before a school concert isn&#39;t the season.
It took me awhile to realize it when the kids were much smaller and it wasn&#39;t until my wife made the connection between their&amp;nbsp;pre&#45;bedtime wrestling and post&#45;bedtime insomnia that I grasped the concept of riling time.&amp;nbsp; Unlike adults, most of whom can control themselves at a moment&#39;s notice when the need arises, kids are unable to simply control themselves as readily.&amp;nbsp; Riling time is fun and since kids recognize that most fun is good, they&#39;re unwilling &#45; or unable &#45; to regain control.&amp;nbsp; Control is for adults and it&#39;s stunningly dull.&amp;nbsp; So after multiple mornings of hard&#45;to&#45;rouse, cranky children, I learned to pay more attention to the clock.
But tonight was an occasion in which both a mother and grandmother royally goofed.&amp;nbsp; We were attending an informal high school fund&#45;raising concert and the two women plopped next to us with two toddlers.&amp;nbsp; As the chorale gatherered to the stage and found their respective spots, the two adult proceeded to break into raucous peals of bird&#45;like chittering.&amp;nbsp; The toddlers kicked in and soon, most eyes were on the foursome as they created a cacophony of jungle bird noises.&amp;nbsp; The high schoolers raised themselves to attention as the director took her place and the women began to try to control the kids.&amp;nbsp; They gathered the two into their laps and gently shushed them, they placed their index fingers over the kids&#39; lips and spoke several times into their ears, asking and then admonishing them to be quiet.&amp;nbsp; It was an honestly weird situation since I wouldn&#39;t expect two grown women to act in such a manner at such a time.
As the group began to sing, the kids occasionally yelped out a bird&#45;like call and the women became increasingly insistent that the kids control themselves.&amp;nbsp; But the women were in no position to expect immediate obedience since they&#39;d started the ruckus in the first place.&amp;nbsp; The women simply forgot &#45; or didn&#39;t care &#45; that kids take their cues from the adults closely surrounding them and I doubt that it occurred to them that the kids wouldn&#39;t be able to control themselves.&amp;nbsp; Kids also have almost no sense of time and if the parents can get away with something quickly, the kids will think that it&#39;s still occurring and they have free rein.
So what have I had to learn?

    That I can&#39;t rile up the kids at certain times because of soon&#45;to&#45;be&#45;occurring events, such as meals or situations in which they need to be able to sit still for a period of time.
    That in the case of my own kids, I need to have some time after riling time for the kids to decompress.&amp;nbsp; Once they&#39;ve been riled up, the kids won&#39;t just be able to stop but will instead requirement an adjustment period.
    If the kids can&#39;t regain control and make a scene, then I have nobody but myself to blame.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m the adult and they&#39;re the children.
    If they&#39;re a little older, I can remind them of other obligations so that they can remember &#45; or try to, at least &#45; and help themselves maintain control.

The kids tonight actually did a better job of reining themselves in that I anticipated when the entire incident occurred.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The toddlers finally listened and settled down and the high schoolers recovered from the hoopla of the previous song, and I can only hope that the two women understood that they were the issue instead of the kids.

<title>Your Son Want To Take A Walk With You:&nbsp; Pass Up the Quiet Time</title>
<body>It&#39;s 9:15 in the evening and I&#39;ve donned my down vest and cap to take the dog for an evening stroll.&amp;nbsp; Even better, I&#39;ve pulled out my mp3 and earbuds so that I can enjoy some of my own music as we saunter around the block.
Hey Dad, I just got out of the shower but can I walk the dog with you?
No, Son, your hair&#39;s still wet so I&#39;ll just go.
Really, Dad, I&#39;ll only be a minute.&amp;nbsp;
My wife cuts me a glance and I already know what she&#39;s going to say and I nod my head.&amp;nbsp; Sure enough, she says it:&amp;nbsp; Your son wants to take a walk with you.&amp;nbsp; And she&#39;s right, my son wants to take a walk with me.&amp;nbsp;
In that brief fifteen minute excursion, I catch further glimpses of life amongst the teen tribe.&amp;nbsp; How Scream&#45;o isn&#39;t the same as Punk and it really &#45; supposedly &#45; takes considerable talent to master the Death Metal growl.&amp;nbsp; How kids in middle school really don&#39;t listen when you tell them to stop the bean&#45;dips &#45; reaching up and grabbing another&#39;s nipples &#45; and you just have to punch them in the face to make them quit.&amp;nbsp; How I was apparently right in that even our town isn&#39;t as safe as he previously thought, and that truly grabbed my attention.&amp;nbsp; He and some friends were walking home from&amp;nbsp;the high school football game when they were challenged from behind by some older teens and if he&#39;s not exaggerating, had to bluff their way out of the situation.&amp;nbsp; And with each of these snippets, I asked further questions or in the case of the bean&#45;dips and football game incident, offered some suggestions such as not walking home at night in an alley.
As a father, my life really isn&#39;t my own anymore and it&#39;s been that way for years.&amp;nbsp; I miss quiet moments and the latitude to do what I want, when I want to do it.&amp;nbsp; And God knows I miss my favorite musical pieces.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that I have to take advantage of every opportunity to spend time with them even if I&#39;m not in the mood.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s their attempt to maintain the lines of communication and as they age, those lines can fray or become brittle with age so it&#39;s my responsibility and obligation to put away the mp3 and honor the attempt.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m actually counting myself fortunate that my young teen still wants to walk the dog with me and share those insights and moments because I hear plenty from people who feel as though they&#39;ve been completely shut out.
Perhaps however, they really haven&#39;t been shut out but simply haven&#39;t realized that they&#39;ve been approached.&amp;nbsp; The time spent together doesn&#39;t have to be earth&#45;shattering and when teens come, it&#39;s frequently when it suits them instead of on the parents&#39; schedule.&amp;nbsp; Dad might be tired, sore or just craving some privacy and quiet but it&#39;s still the first rule of fatherhood in effect, that a father&#39;s life is no longer his own.&amp;nbsp; So pay attention when the teen comes up and says something to you.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t the dog or the other stuff, it&#39;s you that he or she wants.
Better yet, pretend that my wife is looking at you and then put away whatever it is that you&#39;re doing.</body>

<body>If you&#39;re fortunate, you&#39;ll tie in with a network&amp;nbsp;of folks who are able to pass along outgrown clothing, thus helping to keep those costs under control.&amp;nbsp; That also means that there&#39;s going to be clothing that&#39;s stored away and has to be periodically sorted both by size and seasonality and that task is something that I do twice each year when the weather starts turning cold or warm.&amp;nbsp; It does raise the occasional question of whether there&#39;s actually too much clothing to keep in the house.
We&#39;re fortunate in that we have two boys and are physically/emotionally close to another family with two boys and there&#39;s been a flow of clothing through the years.&amp;nbsp; They also have a daughter, but she and our daughter are similar enough in size and age that we really haven&#39;t been able to process hand&#45;me&#45;downs for the girl.&amp;nbsp; So what&#39;s the logistical process for sorting and&amp;nbsp; handling the flow of clothing?

    Start with the youngest child and cull through the clothing, either throwing out or passing along what he or she can clearly no longer wear.&amp;nbsp; It took me a while to finally visualize a pipeline between one kid and the next one and realizing that if there wasn&#39;t room for the clothing being passed down, I&#39;d wind up with a stack &#45; or pile &#45; of clothes with no room for storage.
    You can visually size up what&#39;s obviously too small and move that to a separate pile&amp;nbsp;for later processing.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s obviously wearable for the colder or warmer weather is separated and yet another stack is composed of what the child actually has to try on.&amp;nbsp; My experience has been that it&#39;s best to just pull the child for one stack of try&#45;ons instead of constantly asking him or her to come away from the activity and creating resentment.
    Pay&amp;nbsp;attention to the condition of the clothing.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve kept and patched jeans that are ripped but I then have to be careful that those are the pants that are worn for Saturday play instead of making it to school.&amp;nbsp;
    Since kids don&#39;t grow at a constant rate, expect that not everything is going to be the exactly right length.&amp;nbsp; Pants might be a bit short or long and depending on how much and what is available, might have to be worn until they are either unacceptably short or are finally the right length.&amp;nbsp; The same goes for shirts.&amp;nbsp;
    In dealing with shirts, this process gives you the opportunity to cull what&#39;s acceptable in terms of language.&amp;nbsp; Many &#39;tweeners and teens today wear shirts with messages and there are many parents who simply say nothing about the message.&amp;nbsp; Our stance has been that shirts with messages are fine for play but not school and even then, the message can contain no offensive language.&amp;nbsp; A case in point is the farting dog shirt that simply wound up in the trash.
    You might have to decide how much is too much.&amp;nbsp; A year ago, our eldest boy had eight pairs of jeans that fit simultaneously, but does a boy need eight pair of jeans?&amp;nbsp; In our case, I held several pair back for the younger boy.
    The offsetting question is whether the child has any other clothing besides jeans and play clothing?&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know of any families where the girls don&#39;t have some dresses or more formal clothing, but boys can be so rough and tumble that it&#39;s easy to forget that they do need to have more formal clothing, even if it&#39;s simply khakis and one or two dress shirts.&amp;nbsp; In our case, each of the boys has one or two pair of dress pants and a pair of khakis, along with some ties and decent sweaters.
    The final question is where you want the old clothing to go.&amp;nbsp; Is there another family that can use the clothing?&amp;nbsp; Do you have a favorite charity?&amp;nbsp; In our case, there&#39;s a bag of kids and adult clothing that will go to the school district, which is organizing a free clothing give&#45;away within the next several days.

<title>Helping or Taking Over the Schoolwork?</title>
<body>Almost every parent wants their kid to do well &#45; I say almost since I&#39;ve met a few who honestly couldn&#39;t give a tinker&#39;s dam about their kid &#45; and that leeches over to the schoolwork.&amp;nbsp; How far do you go in helping before taking over the process in its entirety?&amp;nbsp; When is it too much?
I&#39;m facing that question now as Eldest is involved in an A(dvanced)P(lacement) US History course.&amp;nbsp; Part of her assignment for the year is to write an original paper on some topic of interest.&amp;nbsp; She came home last week with three tomes on US Economic History from the school library and when I inquired as to why she&#39;d have a 400+ page history of American economic development, she told me that her topic was the history and development of the dollar and the controversy between a fiat dollar and a gold&#45#45;backed dollar.&amp;nbsp; I was honestly stunned as she stood near me in the kitchen; it&#39;s a topic of which few are aware but one that I find of exceptional pertinence in this day.&amp;nbsp; This PracticalDad econogeek has shared concerns over the economic future of the country since it&#39;s her generation that stands on the precipice of an economic cliff and while I talked about it, I was never entirely sure that she or her brother was listening.
Yes, she was listening &#45; even with one earbud dangling from her left ear.
Further discussion revealed that she needed at least a half&#45;dozen primary and more secondary sources and as I also looked at the AP Physics textbook on the kitchen counter, I actually pitied the kid for the amount of work that she&#39;s taken upon herself.&amp;nbsp; It also dawned on me that she&#39;d decided upon the topic because she understood that dear ol&#39; PracticalDad had a clue of the subject, even if he&#39;s not an expert.&amp;nbsp; Further, It was&amp;nbsp;a means by which I could&amp;nbsp;maintain a common bond with a teen who&#39;s a&amp;nbsp;social butterfly and actively in the college decision process.&amp;nbsp; So it behooves&amp;nbsp;each of us to work together.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
But how far do I take it?&amp;nbsp; Both her mother and&amp;nbsp;I have stressed the academics &#45;&amp;nbsp;everything flows from the schoolwork &#45;&amp;nbsp;but we&amp;nbsp;have actively demurred from doing the homework as some other parents do.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve even gone so far&amp;nbsp;as to&amp;nbsp;create mock tests for her&amp;nbsp;and Middle&amp;nbsp;and have&amp;nbsp;assisted on isolated questions but have refused to do more than&amp;nbsp;two or three homework problems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Why not?&amp;nbsp; Because I&#39;m&amp;nbsp;not always going to be there, that&#39;s&amp;nbsp;why.&amp;nbsp; Now use what we&#39;ve done as a model.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There is no plan&amp;nbsp;to write it for her and I&amp;nbsp;can&#39;t explain everything since she can&#39;t use&amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp;as either a primary or secondary source, but I can at least whittle down the amount of reading that she&amp;nbsp;has to do.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The result is that I&#39;ve taken the liberty of&amp;nbsp;pointing out what chapters in the three tomes are pertinent to her topic so that she doesn&#39;t waste time reading about American Agricultural Economics in the mid&#45;19th century.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, I&#39;ve pointed her to multiple other sources that provide what she&#39;ll need to gain an understanding of the topic.&amp;nbsp; The final part of my task will be to&amp;nbsp;help develop a&amp;nbsp;basic reading list so that she can read on the topic chronologically and thus keep some sense of order.&amp;nbsp; After that, she&#39;s on her own and I&#39;ll limit any further involvement to explaining what I can.
It&#39;s easy for parents to think that the kids don&#39;t care about being around them anymore.&amp;nbsp; There are friends and activities and they never seem to have enough time in the day for what they want to do, and the parents wonder what happened to that little kid who wanted to spend so much time around them.&amp;nbsp; But there are still moments when the kids will come to you and you have to put things aside and grab the opportunity when it presents itself because it&#39;s often as much the teen wanting to stay connected as it is the question or issue itself.&amp;nbsp; The venue or activity will change as they age, but the desire to stay connected is still there.&amp;nbsp;
I had no intention of spending considerable time perusing economics and historical texts for information on the gold standard and the several decade change to the fiat currency.&amp;nbsp; But it is something that I can do to help the kid as she prepares for the AP paper.&amp;nbsp; And I&#39;ll stay available to discuss the questions that she has as the year progresses, because that time is not long for this stage of our lives together.

<title>Preparing the Kids:&nbsp; Going Counterculture</title>
<body>Abraham Lincoln remarked that you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can&#39;t fool all of the people all of the time. Some time ago, I read that a strong majority of American adults&amp;nbsp;now believe that the opportunities for our offspring will be less than the opportunities that we had when we became adults and this group falls into the third category of Lincoln&#39;s comment.&amp;nbsp; If we truly are in trouble, what must I do to help prepare my kids for such a future?
PracticalDad, Hippie
The first lesson of preparing the kids for the new economic world is to be purposefully countercultural.
When economists and the bobbleheads on CNBC talk about deflation, they&#39;re not necessarily talking about a decrease in prices, they&#39;re actually talking about a drop in the amount of liquidity&amp;nbsp;and credit available in the financial system.&amp;nbsp; One of the notable items since the bailouts of late 2008 is that large banks are given huge amounts of credit but the credit for consumers contracted and only recently began to increase again.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re still being pushed to spend but with flat or declining incomes and food inflation, more and more of us are finally being pushed to the wall and most will only change when there is neither time nor option.&amp;nbsp; When you&#39;ve been raised and taught a certain way, the trauma to the perceptions and psyche can be exquisitely painful.
Our forebears taught their kids that one of the crucial financial skills was to practice savings.&amp;nbsp; The future was uncertain and you had to take responsibility for your financial health.&amp;nbsp; On an aggregate basis, that meant that there was also sufficient capital available for investing in projects and products that actually helped to create national wealth.&amp;nbsp; Today, that&#39;s turned around as the corporate culture punishes those who save and rewards those who learn to consume, especially on credit.&amp;nbsp; Sitting on the kitchen island as I write this is a mailer from American Express for their prepaid AmEx card for teens, touting that it&#39;s neither debit nor credit but with all kinds of online tools to help them track their spending and manage their budgeting.&amp;nbsp; Next to the mailer is Eldest&#39;s savings account statement, showing an annualized interest rate yield of .1%.
Why save when we can help you learn how to spend in the adult world?
There are no magic answers or pop&#45;psychology techniques to confronting the prevailing culture.&amp;nbsp; If you don&#39;t want to go Amish and completely ban all external electronic tethers to your kids, the you have to be prepared to monitor and control them.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s both time&#45;consuming and frustrating to have to keep tabs on what and how long they&#39;ve been immersed in the electronic culture but it&#39;s necessary.&amp;nbsp; The entire electronic culture is saturated with spending messages and cross&#45;marketing techniques and the first line of defense is simply to control it as much as possible.&amp;nbsp; How pervasive is it?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One dark night several months ago, Youngest was taking cans to the recycling bin when he sang out Red Robin! and a stranger walking his dog down the&amp;nbsp;block called back YUMMMMM!
Along with limiting electronics, you have to have a sense of what&#39;s out there.

    Keep the screen electronics &#45; computers and televisions &#45; in a public area so that you can keep an eye on what&#39;s being seen.&amp;nbsp; I understand that there&#39;s no way that I&#39;ll see everything but I view it as a parental quality control device, a visual random sampling.
    Use the parental control tools available onthe family computer to limit the time spent or the hours that it can be viewed so that if you&#39;re not around, it can&#39;t be used.&amp;nbsp;
    Review the browser history and visit some of the sites that the kids are at to see what they&#39;re viewing.
    Take some time to visit MTV and view some of their offering.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve also spent time viewing Cartoon Network&#39;s Adult Swim.

When moving beyond the household walls, be purposeful in how&amp;nbsp; you spend your own money.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve ratcheted down my own spending significantly and have cut my personal expenses for the coffee and muffins, choosing instead to brew my own and work through a pot in about two days.&amp;nbsp; When you&#39;re shopping with the kids, audibly ask yourself whether you actually need that item that you&#39;ve been eyeing or whether it&#39;sactually only something that you want.&amp;nbsp; discuss it aloud when you&#39;re with the kids and opt to keep the wallet in the pocket instead; while you might not think so, they really are listening and taking in what you say.&amp;nbsp; If you have to go to the mall for something, take the kids along but tell them in advance that the purchases made will be only for the needed items.&amp;nbsp; Show them that it&#39;s possible to walk out with having spent unnecessarily.
Talking is crucial, especially when the kids are saturated in a media world that specializes in promoting consumption by blurring the lines between need and want.&amp;nbsp; Why do you buy a car &#45; to get from one place to another or to make a statement about your tastes and values?&amp;nbsp; Is the need to have a new car worth the amount of money that&#39;s going to be lost to depreciation in the car&#39;s first three years of ownership?
Pay attention to where and when you shop.&amp;nbsp; While my wife is in a position in which she has to dress well, I&#39;m not and I frankly buy the everyday wear at Goodwill.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve passed this along to the kids and now the older two prefer to shop there in lieu of going to chain stores that provide cheaper clothing made in China and the Pacific Rim.&amp;nbsp; My comments have been frank in that I&#39;d rather provide business to an entity that employs the locally disabled than an entity that&#39;s paying a pittance to some poor foreign &#39;tweener and pocketing the rest.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, instead of shopping&amp;nbsp;at the major supermarket that&#39;s owned by a Dutch conglomerate, we now do most of our food purchases at the locally owned grocery as well as at local farmers markets.
Buying food locally and eschewing the culture might sound like a hippie thing, but it is important.&amp;nbsp; Our children will have to think outside the current economic model&#39;s box and seeing money flowing to those who don&#39;t fit the model will be instructive.</body>

<title>Sexist PracticalDad:&nbsp; Different Safety Rules for Different Genders?</title>
<body>I was taken aback the other day when Eldest complained that I was a sexist.&amp;nbsp; HUH?&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re complaining to a guy who&#39;s bent gender issues in all manner of shapes and angles.&amp;nbsp; Her comment was prompted by a safety situation that occurred the previous evening in which she believed that she&#39;d been wronged.
We live in a small suburban community in an agricultural area and there&#39;s no crime the likes of which you read about in the larger communities.&amp;nbsp; I was preoccupied when she said that she&#39;d be taking a jog and didn&#39;t notice that it was already dark in the early evening.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s an athletic, strong teen who likes to jog on non&#45;sport practice days to keep in shape.&amp;nbsp; Within ten minutes, Middle asked if he could also take a jog and I permitted it, again not noticing that it was dark outside &#45; bad on me.&amp;nbsp; Middle is a few years younger but already taller than his elder sibling and immeasurably stronger due to consistent exercise through the years; this is a kid who announced in the kitchen at the age of six that he wanted a six&#45;pack and had one by the age of eleven.&amp;nbsp;
He returned a few minutes after his sister and caught us in the midst of discussion&amp;nbsp;because I&#39;d since realized that it was actually dark outside.&amp;nbsp; My stance was that while I appreciated that she wanted to stay in shape, I no longer would permit her to run after dark unless she ran with another person; otherwise, she&#39;d only be running alone when there was still daylight.&amp;nbsp; We disagreed but she respected my reasoning that running alone after dark was simply inviting problems.&amp;nbsp; While she was still in the room, Middle asked whether the same rule applied to him and after looking at the kid, I stated that yes, he could continue to run alone after dark, but only in the early evening.&amp;nbsp; My thinking was that he was strong enough&amp;nbsp;and fast&amp;nbsp;enough to avoid any problems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
It was at lunch the next day that the previous evening&#39;s conversation came up and Eldest asked why the rule applied only to her instead of him.&amp;nbsp; Again,&amp;nbsp;she&#39;s female and the reality is that it&#39;s likelier that lone females are prey&amp;nbsp;to attackers&amp;nbsp;than lone males.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Predatory&amp;nbsp;males are cueing on lone females instead of lone males and such predators are typically armed in some manner.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Additionally, her younger brother was still younger and stronger than she was.&amp;nbsp; It was&amp;nbsp; here that&amp;nbsp;she&amp;nbsp;called me a sexist and truly pulled me up&amp;nbsp;short.&amp;nbsp;
I stewed on the comment through the remainder of lunch and afterwards pulled both elder kids aside.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s the deal then.&amp;nbsp; You might consider this rule sexist, but you&#39;ll still only run at night with a buddy.&amp;nbsp; However, bad things can also happen to a lone male so that your brother will be bound by the same rule; he&#39;s not a full&#45;grown adult and the prospect for problems exists as well.&amp;nbsp; If you want to run at night, then you&#39;ll have to run together.&amp;nbsp; I believe that I&#39;m correct in not permitting Eldest to run alone after dark.&amp;nbsp; But I was wrong to think that Middle&#39;s gender would be fool&#45;proof protection against attack or mugging.&amp;nbsp; Congratulations, you&#39;re right.&amp;nbsp; And you&#39;re also wrong.
Kids often live in a world that&#39;s devoid of external dangers, at least that&#39;s for kids living in low&#45;crime or rural areas.&amp;nbsp; Safety consciousness is a learned skill and it will take much continued talk and effort to get the kids to think about the threats of the outside.&amp;nbsp; Threats that are larger than a father that you find quaintly overprotective.</body>

<title>Teenagers</title>
<body>God save us from teenagers.
When the children are very young, they are self&#45;absorbed and generally clueless but one holds out hope that they&#39;ll grow out of it when they hit their teens.&amp;nbsp; But once they hit their teens, you understand that the self&#45;absorption is still there and the nature of the cluelessness changes.&amp;nbsp; They can handle multiple electronics simultaneously and perform academic/intellectual functions that are actually quite impressive.&amp;nbsp; But they still can&#39;t remember to give you the details on where they want to go with their friends.&amp;nbsp; They are convinced of their invincibility &#45; as I was when I was that age &#45; and are generally unaware of the dangers that can surround them, unless they&#39;re forced to adapt due to living in a dangerous neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; When you try to talk to them, the response is akin to the dog in the Far Side cartoon:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Blah blah blah blah Fido blah blah blah.
If I had to find a television father who most temperamentally resembled my own father, it would have to be Red Forman of&amp;nbsp;That &#39;70s Show.&amp;nbsp; For all of his wonderful qualities, he was cranky and generally intolerant of teenage boneheadedness; being called a dumbass was a familiar experience.&amp;nbsp; I promised myself with Eldest&#39;s birth that I wouldn&#39;t continue that experience with them and for the very large part I&#39;ve been successful but it has really gotten much harder as the years pass.&amp;nbsp; My father, and other men that I&#39;ve met through the years with teenagers, have commonly used the term &amp;quot;half&#45;assed&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;as an adjective.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s one that I&#39;ve tried to avoid but&amp;nbsp;there are now moments when I quietly offer it up as I consider something that&#39;s been said or done.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Like many other fathers through the course of generations.
I wonder if scientists have finally figured out what most fathers know.&amp;nbsp; The last step in the maturation of the teen body into adulthood is that the kid finally develops a second buttock, qualifying him or her as no longer being half&#45;assed.
And until then, I just have to hang on.

<title>My Kids and the Coming Economy</title>
<body>A large part of my paternal job is to keep tabs on the world and how it affects my family.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s happening and what must I do to adapt?&amp;nbsp; More importantly, how do I help prepare my children for the world in which they&#39;re going to live?
Parental roles are slowly blending and blurring as fathers take on childcare and mothers expand into the workforce.&amp;nbsp; But each still has a certain impact upon the kids and for dads, it&#39;s how the child perceives and interacts with the outside world.&amp;nbsp; Research has shown that it&#39;s a father&#39;s input that helps spur vocabulary and language skills in small children.&amp;nbsp; When fathers were actively involved, the language skills of a three year&#45;old were higher at a statistically significant level.&amp;nbsp; More recent research finds that a dad&#39;s horseplay and interaction with the kids encourages exploration and self&#45;confidence; this helps them meet and cope with the larger outside world.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s simply part of our job to prepare our children to survive and be productive in the world.
But our times are significantly different than our own parents&#39; and the economic challenges facing our children will make ours pale in comparison.&amp;nbsp; If we&#39;re going to prepare them, we have to first get a handle on what they&#39;ll be facing in the future.
Through A Glass, Darkly
Stroll through the internet&#39;s economics offerings and you&#39;ll find the full gamut of opinions on what&#39;s going to happen and unless you live in Chile or Norway, little of it is good.&amp;nbsp; Views are offered by economists, investment strategists and advisers, pundits and even the odd economic astrologer.&amp;nbsp; This opinion spectrum ranges from stagflation and economic depression to Japan&#45;style deflation and hyperinflation; to paraphrase one economics blogger,&amp;nbsp;we really have no idea what will happen.
The short&#45;term future is fuzzy at best but statistics and anecdotal evidence make the long&#45;term outcome pretty certain.

    The quoted unemployment rate (U&#45;3) is stuck persistently at 9.5%+ but the more realistic rate of U&#45;6 is closer to 17%.
    The gap between the wealthiest Americans &#45; the top 1% of wage&#45;earners &#45; and the rest of the country has widened to a level not seen since the days just prior to the Great Depression.
    We remain an oil&#45;based economy with an oil&#45;based infrastructure, reliant upon foreign suppliers&amp;nbsp;who often don&#39;t like us and only tolerate us for our military and our currency; unfortunately, you can&#39;t field a military without a viable currency.
    Precious metals&amp;nbsp;prices &#45; an indicator of fear and instability &#45; are at global 30 year highs as individuals and institutions purchase them to counter the continuing devaluation of the dollar and other fiat currencies.
    Within the past several weeks, 25 nations have piled into what the Brazilian Finance Minister openly calls a &amp;quot;currency war&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Even Peru bought $12M in order to drive up the dollar versus whatever they call their currency.
    The US Federal Reserve System will again engage&amp;nbsp;in further quantitative easing, effectively flooding the economy with even more cash and liquidity.
    The financial markets are largely broken.&amp;nbsp; The pervasive use of High Frequency Trading&amp;nbsp;has led to a market&#45;wide &amp;quot;flash crash&amp;quot; with multiple smaller flash crashes amongst individual stocks, most notably Apple Computer.
    Through unfettered lobbying and campaign contributions, the financial system has corrupted the legal/political system to a degree unmatched in our nation&#39;s history.&amp;nbsp; In 2009, Senator Richard Durbin (IL) told an interviewer that on Capitol Hill, banks &amp;quot;own the place&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; The attitude of lenders has become so cavalier regarding such bedrock legal principles of title and property&#45;ownership that in 23 states, large mortgage lenders have suspended foreclosure proceedings&amp;nbsp;when the courts found that cases brought didn&#39;t adhere to basic principles and in some cases, the bank had no actual financial interest in the property.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, mortgage servicers hired by lenders have been caught presenting counterfeit court summons&amp;nbsp;attesting that foreclosure notices were delivered when they really were not.&amp;nbsp; Most disturbingly, Reuters news recently reported that advance notes of the Federal Reserve Open Markets Committee meetings are being provided to paying clients by a former Federal Reserve System governor in advance of their release to the general public.
    Our elected representatives are failing in their most basic duties as they leave for a pre&#45;election recess without having yet passed an actual budget.

Viewing even only this partial statistical and anecdotal evidence, our nation really does sit on the cusp of huge structural challenges that haven&#39;t been faced in generations.
The Long&#45;Term Upshot
Whether it happens hard or easy in the near&#45;term, the long&#45;term outcome for our children is difficult.&amp;nbsp; There is real risk that the American Middle Class will be largely eliminated as the political and financial elites sacrifice the common good for their own personal power and benefit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our children will be marginalized to an underclass forced to subsist in lower&#45;wage jobs with little hope of real prosperity, their earnings spent meeting the debt payments on a societal&#45;wide model based upon the company town model of the 19th/20th century coal fields.&amp;nbsp; Their freedoms will be likewise jeopardized as those in positions of power continue to consolidate and maintain their grasp on the levers of government, twisting the screws even further as they bleed the future underclass.
So what can any typical father do?&amp;nbsp; There are no magic tricks to suddenly undo what&#39;s been in the making for decades and it&#39;s doubtful that there will be any call for great acts of heroism or civil disobedience.&amp;nbsp; The great changes will have to be made at the family level and it&#39;s our job as fathers to expose them to the wider world as we do with our words, language and horseplay.

<title>Yelling At Other People&#8217;s Kids</title>
<body>When the San Jose cop &amp;quot;arrested&amp;quot; his stepdaughter&#39;s boyfriend for sleeping with her, the story raised all manner of questions.&amp;nbsp; Most pertain to whether the officer was appropriate in using his station to scare the boy and others pertain to whether the daughter should have been busted instead of the son.&amp;nbsp; A more basic question is how much latitude a parent has in dealing with Opie (Other Peoples kid).&amp;nbsp; Just how far can and should you go?
Let&#39;s put the immediate question of the San Jose stepfather/cop to bed &#45; I doubt that there&#39;d be any issue at all if he&#39;s simply punched the teen while out of uniform.&amp;nbsp; But utilizing an official process to &amp;quot;scare&amp;quot; a kid, especially in the boy&#39;s home, was simply unacceptable.&amp;nbsp; Now let&#39;s move on.
There are multiple factors coming into play with Opies.&amp;nbsp;

    Are the other parents even around to help supervise or are you the sole adult in charge?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s likely that if you&#39;ve got a toddler playdate at a neighbor&#39;s house that you&#39;ll have to take much action apart from monitoring your own.&amp;nbsp; The other parent is there to keep tabs on their own child and at the younger ages, simple redirection is often the only thing necessary to keep things in check.&amp;nbsp; That said, it&#39;s not uncommon to &amp;quot;talk shop&amp;quot;, which for parents often relates to common disciplinary measures so that you get a measure of the other parent&#39;s views and preferences.&amp;nbsp; And if things do spiral out of control, then you should immediately let the other parent contend with the kid.
    Are you a parent or are you fulfilling another role, such as leader at an event in which you have some legal responsibility?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve found &#45; and others have confirmed &#45; that if you&#39;re in charge, then the other parents are generally happy to let you handle the discipline short of corporal punishment.&amp;nbsp; On multiple occasions in scouting, I&#39;ve noted that some parents&#39; attitude is akin to he&#39;s your issue, have at it and good luck as Junior runs amok in the room.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, there have been few issues when I&#39;ve assigned time&#45;outs or even pulled a boy aside for a chat.&amp;nbsp;
    What&#39;s the child&#39;s age?&amp;nbsp; You might think that you have to be more &amp;quot;in the face&amp;quot; with smaller children who are out of control, but the younger more routinely only require quiet correction of some kind; it&#39;s the teens who&#39;ve been caught up in the cycle of group thoughtlessness who require a stronger hand.&amp;nbsp; Teens will tend to get caught up in the moment and group dynamics as they feed off of one another; there are also other issues such as saving face amongst the peers when confronted with an adult who&#39;s trying to maintain or regain control.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, my moments of truly yelling have been with groups of &#39;tweeners and teens who&#39;ve gone totally around the bend.&amp;nbsp; Younger kids can still be intimidated and awed by the size of the upset adult and are more likely to be physically scared (which might or might not be a good thing) while the larger teens might feel the need to prove something.
    What&#39;s the severity of the incident?&amp;nbsp; If I find teens &#45; for whom I&#39;m responsible &#45; driving around with other teens on the hood of the car, then I have no qualms about going ballistic on them; the chance of injury or death justifies yelling so that the shock breaks through their event barrier and grabs their undivided attention.&amp;nbsp; Yelling because the television is too loud in the basement is overkill.
    Do I want to embarrass my own child?&amp;nbsp; Actually, if my own kid is there and I feel obliged to yell or become unpleasant, then embarrassment is the least of his or her problems.

It&#39;s actually rare to have to become unpleasant with opies and many will take listen once you have their attention.&amp;nbsp; Only once have I had to actually get physical with teens and that was to protect my own kids, then toddlers.&amp;nbsp; The regional park to which I took&amp;nbsp; my own kids had an elevated playground in a copse of trees &#45; seriously cool &#45; and unsupervised teens were running through it repeatedly with the risk of a small child being knocked off.&amp;nbsp; One parent said something to no effect and when one group ran past, I shoulder&#45;blocked the leading boy and knocked him askew.&amp;nbsp; Gee, sorry about that.&amp;nbsp; Guess you&#39;d better watch where you&#39;re going.&amp;nbsp; My point was taken and the group moved on.&amp;nbsp;
But if I ever find a boy with my daughter...

<title>Kids, Guilt and Embarrassment</title>
<body>The past several decades have been a parental anomaly.&amp;nbsp; Parents have been concerned with their child&#39;s self&#45;esteem and image, and have often wished to be considered as much friend as parent.&amp;nbsp; That means that there&#39;s generally less discipline and control and&amp;nbsp;techniques that&amp;nbsp;our grandparents used have gone by the wayside.&amp;nbsp; Two tools that have fallen out of use are embarrassment and old&#45;fashioned guilt.&amp;nbsp; Is it ever appropriate to embarrass the child or make him feel guilty?
Actually, yes and I&#39;ve used them both on occasion&amp;nbsp;as they&#39;re tools to be used to maintain discipline and teach, as much as groundings, time&#45;outs, privilege&#45;loss and old&#45;fashioned jawboning.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re used on every occasion &#45; and they should actually be used sparingly &#45; but neither are they to be avoided.
Embarrassment and guilt are powerfully negative feelings and kids are like everybody in that they&#39;ll act to avoid the sense&amp;nbsp;that these feelings bring.&amp;nbsp; But these are actually learned sensations and if a child doesn&#39;t know to be embarrassed or feel guilty, then she simply won&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; I think that there&#39;s actually some value in these negatives; each reflects an awareness of other people and indicates that the child understands that there are other beings in the world apart from themselves.&amp;nbsp;
Embarrassment&#39;s value is in helping the child to learn to control impulses and exercise some thought process instead of just doing something without any consideration as to the consequences.&amp;nbsp; When there&#39;s an obvious and glaring outcome, there might even be no need on my part to embarrass the child since the action speaks solely for itself.&amp;nbsp; For example, if&amp;nbsp;Junior is playing a sport and his goofing off on the field leads to a goal for the other team, there&#39;s no need for me to highlight anything since his teammates will swiftly and certainly bring it to his attention.&amp;nbsp; In those instances in which Junior has been embarrassed by his actions, I&#39;ve had to do nothing more than just acknowledge quietly that he had reason to be embarrassed.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, son.&amp;nbsp; You should have been embarrassed &#45; so what do you take away from this?&amp;nbsp; A kid&#39;s parents might not want to embarrass the child but his peers will certainly think nothing of it and a few will take to it like a pig to slop.&amp;nbsp; Where I&#39;ve come to really utilize embarrassment is when my child is absolutely old enough to know better and the behavior is so glaringly stupid that it borders on or crosses into dangerous territory.&amp;nbsp; Teens are notorious for lacking the ability to assess risk, let along simply judgment in many cases and even when presented with the possible negative outcomes, will simply think that can&#39;t happen to me.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case when there are multiple kids together and absolutely none of them is thinking clearly, in which a cold dose of embarrassment will quickly bring things to a halt.&amp;nbsp; For example, finding three teenage boys playing tag in the rafter of a picnic pavilion more than ten feet above a concrete slab floor brought a vividly phrased condemnation to bring the point home.&amp;nbsp; Maybe you won&#39;t fall, but you can be damned sure that you&#39;ll get your self&#45;esteem mangled if not your ribcage.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, misbehavior with a vehicle stands as ground for embarrassment and outright humiliation if the need arises.&amp;nbsp; Kids and teens might not remember reason, but they will acutely remember embarrassment before their peers.&amp;nbsp; Like many disciplinary situations however, there has to be a calmer follow&#45;up conversation to bring the point home.&amp;nbsp; Pairing the immediate embarrassment with a later conversation can have a positive outcome.
Guilt differs from embarrassment in that the concern arises out of the consequences involving another instead of oneself.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It doesn&#39;t have to have such a public cause and few, if any, need to be aware of the sense of guilt.&amp;nbsp; Most kids and teens with any conscience will experience the pangs of guilt and it usually isn&#39;t necessary to inflict that sense on the child.&amp;nbsp; Where I have had to inflict a sense of guilt on one of my children has been when there&#39;s been no realization that the behavior involves another person; the child will spin in his or her own little world unaware of how the behavior or attitude affects someone else.&amp;nbsp; In those rare instances, I&#39;ve mentioned the concept of shame and the shock of the language and tone has usually been enough to bring the point home.&amp;nbsp; Again, it&#39;s imperative that you talk with your child soon afterward so as to wade through the morass of upset and conflicting emotions until the other side has been reached.
Having to contend with a child who&#39;s out of control requires some quick judgment on your part and it&#39;s not my intent to provide wholesale endorsement of these two measures.&amp;nbsp; However, they do have their place and value and if you find yourself in the heat of the moment utilizing them, don&#39;t necessarily condemn yourself as a poor parent or incompetent.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re actually doing the kid a favor.

<title>What Exactly is Monetization?</title>
<body>One of the things that people might be hearing from the economics blogs is the question of whether &#45; and to what extent &#45; the Federal Reserve System is gaming the system.&amp;nbsp; What is meant by quantitative easing and what does it mean to say the Fed is Monetizing the Debt ?&amp;nbsp;
The&amp;nbsp;above link is to an article in a business/economics site entitled Zerohedge.&amp;nbsp; The site is like many other economics sites in which the writer (here the pseudonymous Tyler Durden) has a particular point of view as to how things will turn out in the world of money.&amp;nbsp; In this case, Durden espouses the case of monetary&amp;nbsp;collapse and hyperinflation, which is a particularly scary outcome arising from our economic difficulties.&amp;nbsp;
The reality is that times are truly tough and no one knows what&#39;s going to happen as a result of these policies and actions.&amp;nbsp; But the article does a decent job of explaining what it means when you hear talk of monetizing the debt and walking through the essential pathways of how it happens, so I thought it might be of some benefit to folks.&amp;nbsp; As an additional treat, follow the comments thread for an eye&#45;opening look at what some others believe and the opinions and arguments that they make.&amp;nbsp; It makes for fascinating, eye&#45;opening and occasionally hilarious reading.
I have no final idea of what&#39;s going to result from the policies and actions of our leaders and central bankers.&amp;nbsp; But follow enough and you&#39;ll learn that neither does anybody else, so we&#39;re all even.</body>

<title>A Christine O&#8217;Donnell &#8220;Controversy&#8221;:&nbsp; Fifteen Years for a College Degree</title>
<body>While reading a recent news article regarding the neophyte Republican Senate candidate from Delaware, Christine O&#39;Donnell, I was struck by the comment from the writer (unfortunately, I can&#39;t find the link).&amp;nbsp; Regardless, the writer commented on multiple questions and controversies, one of which was the fact that it took her about fifteen years to obtain her college degree from Fairleigh Dickinson.&amp;nbsp; The article also noted her comment that it took her about ten years to pay off her student loans.
Is this really a controversy as much as a commentary on the hurdles facing young people trying to obtain their degree?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s parse the facts.&amp;nbsp; She obtained her college degree this year and is about 41 years of age.&amp;nbsp; If it took her fifteen years, that means that she would have started college while in her mid&#45;twenties.&amp;nbsp; If it took her about ten years to pay off her loans, which implies that she&#39;s now debt free of student loans, then she probably took on considerable debt but was then unable to complete college due, at least in part, to a lack of funding.&amp;nbsp; It took years to pay off the debt and bring some order to her finances before she could finally complete the degree.
What does this mean for an average person completing this degree at this stage in life?&amp;nbsp; While my father taught me not to make assumptions &#45; it makes an ass out of you and me &#45; there are moments when it&#39;s instructive.&amp;nbsp; Assume that the data is correct and a person really does make significantly more &#45; almost $1 million &#45; over their life with a degree than without.&amp;nbsp; Assume that the average age of a woman giving birth for the first time is twenty&#45;five, which according to the National Center on Health Statistics, it is.&amp;nbsp; A person who has to take additional time to complete their degree without ending up in debt afterwards will finally have the opportunity to make the higher salary only when they&#39;re finally in their &amp;quot;green years&amp;quot; and if there&#39;s a child, it&#39;s a teen starting to look at college.&amp;nbsp; The income flows that are necessary to help them care for their families and prepare for their own retirements are postponed with the result that the person is facing a working retirement well past sixty&#45;five years of age.&amp;nbsp; If the person held off on children during that period and still wants a family, then the family&#39;s financial situation will be that the kid&#39;s education will be kicking in when a worker would be actively considering retirement about two generations ago.
Whether you agree with the assumptions or not, the reality is that the cost of today&#39;s higher education have a major impact on young people.&amp;nbsp; Some choose to postpone forming their own families until their debts are paid off or reduced and they can afford a house in which to raise the kids.&amp;nbsp; Some choose to purchase older cars with the resulting loss of car sales and employment at the dealer and on the line.&amp;nbsp; Some simply give up and default, accepting that they&#39;ll be haunted forever by the debt around their neck.&amp;nbsp; These kinds of scenarios can only be avoided if:

    the youth has clear guidance and an understanding of the process in obtaining and financing a degree;
    the youth is willing to explore and accept alternatives to the model of goin&#39; off for four years;
    College costs are somehow brought under control so that it&#39;s once again relatively affordable.

Since #3 won&#39;t happen without significant public pressure, governmental intervention or a certifiable miracle, then it&#39;s up to us to involve ourselves and keep talking to the kids.
I&#39;m thoroughly unfamiliar with Christine O&#39;Donnell and hadn&#39;t heard of her until the Delaware republican primary.&amp;nbsp; But the willingness to stick to a plan for fifteen years and finish it without debt is actually something of which to be proud.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the fact that some find this mindset controversial is what should really be controversial.

<title>Getting On The Bus:&nbsp; Did The Dad Go Too Far?</title>
<body>A recent Today Show Parenting article&amp;nbsp;discussed the situation of an infuriated father who got onto a middle school bus to confront the bullies who were tormenting his daughter.&amp;nbsp; The question is whether he went too far and by the time I found the article, more than 2400 comments were in the thread.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been on the phone with my own child&#39;s principal about bus bullying and can understand this father&#39;s upset, but some comments and questions are in order.

    First, let&#39;s be frank and not confuse these youth as children.&amp;nbsp; The bullies &#45; thugs, actually &#45; were physically assaulting a young teen and humiliating her by placing condoms on her head.&amp;nbsp; At least some of the bullies were young teen males with access to prophylactics and there are frankly sexual overtones to this kind of activity.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d be furious, too.
    Second, the article leaves silent the question of whether the school district and administrators were aware of this behavior.&amp;nbsp; Given the father knew enough to be out there, I can surmise that he&#39;d heard of previous problems and that this was not the first incident.&amp;nbsp; But were the school authorities aware of the situation, either from the family or more especially, the bus driver?
    Third, did the father enter the bus immediately after&amp;nbsp;the incident or was&amp;nbsp;his daughter out of immediate danger?&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
    What precisely was the driver doing about the behaviors?&amp;nbsp; The bus driver is an extension of the school and does have a responsibility to maintain order.&amp;nbsp; I understand that some children can be vicious little bastards and can literally make a busride an excursion into Lord Of The Flies, but that doesn&#39;t absolve the driver of any responsibility.&amp;nbsp; In the past, I&#39;ve known drivers to actually quit the route and immediately return the full load of children to the school for management by the principal; what was this driver doing?

Should he have climbed aboard the bus?&amp;nbsp; It depends upon the timing; if she was out of immediate danger, then he was &#45; as much as I want to agree with him &#45; wrong.&amp;nbsp; The immediate concern is the physical safety and the short term fixes are to simply remove her from the bus until the situation is resolved.&amp;nbsp; The later concern is the handling of the violence so that it&#39;s stopped.&amp;nbsp; In this regard, the Sheriff&#39;s office was correct in that they could also have been contacted since the nature of the harassment/bullying was so overtly sexual that it surpassed the school&#39;s usual scope.
I suspect that the guy will be exonerated or given a very light sentence and given the fear of God.&amp;nbsp; I sympathize with him and in the heat of the moment might have even responded similarly were condoms involved.&amp;nbsp; And I hope that the actions move beyond just the father and extend to the thugs who would treat a teenage girl in such a way.</body>

<title>Keep Talking, They&#8217;re Listening</title>
<body>You repeat yourself so often that you&#39;d like a recorder attached to the hip that would say the phrases so you can save your voice.&amp;nbsp; Hang up the towel.&amp;nbsp; Put your cleats and shinguards in the garage.&amp;nbsp; Put your dishes in the sink, I&#39;m not the butler.&amp;nbsp; Are they even listening?&amp;nbsp; With three kids in three different levels of school and typically surrounded by constant media, I wonder whether they even listen to what I&#39;m saying.&amp;nbsp; But there are occasional moments that reveal that they are indeed listening to you.
A case in point is the other evening&#39;s interaction with Eldest.&amp;nbsp; Eldest is faced with the upcoming SAT and we were in the process of registering her online for the month&#45;away exam.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each registrant is allowed to have the results released &#45; free of charge &#45; to four colleges or universities for recruiting and information purposes and additional ones are for a fee.&amp;nbsp; This actually serves to focus the youngster&#39;s mind on the prospect that college is no longer some far&#45;off dream but something with real implications, and that the college literature that&#39;s coming daily really has meaning.&amp;nbsp; And now Eldest actually had to sit and make some choices as to her preferences out of the dozens that have contacted her.
As we&#39;ve talked over the past two years, my concern has been that an education is imperative to survive and prosper in the world.&amp;nbsp; My other concern however, is that the education must occur without the addition of such levels of student debt that her future after college is crippled with student loan payments.&amp;nbsp; There might have to be some debt, but it should be minimized as much as possible.&amp;nbsp;
Eldest is like most other kids and looks forward to leaving home for the experience.&amp;nbsp; The house rules are so restrictive for someone who&#39;s obviously old enough to handle herself and there are so many friends with whom to spend time and activities to enjoy.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s face it, we&#39;re raising our children to make their way in the world and become productive adults; we won&#39;t turn them away if they have to come home but it&#39;s not what either parent or child necessarily wants.&amp;nbsp;
This is why I was truly surprised when Eldest added the name of the local state university that sits three blocks away from our home.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a good school in it&#39;s own right and has even received national kudos for some of the programs but it isn&#39;t really what she wants.&amp;nbsp; At that moment, I became the child focused on dreams and she became the adult who looked at reality and I inquired why she was adding it to the list.&amp;nbsp; Because I want them to have my results in case I have to go there because of money.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s when I knew that she understood what I&#39;ve been saying for the past several years; part of her experience will depend upon her ability to attract scholarship money and the competition is fierce enough that enough of that money won&#39;t come to her.
We have two years left of high school and she has the intellectual firepower to pull it off &#45; God knows she didn&#39;t get the book smarts from me.&amp;nbsp; But she&#39;s also demonstrating an ability to look beyond and understand that dreams have to be tempered by resources and choices.&amp;nbsp;
I&amp;nbsp;had to remind her the other night to put her cleats and shinguards in the garage and the towel is still wadded up on the bed.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s encouraging to know that she&#39;s listening to what I&#39;m saying and processing it, so I&#39;ll just keep talking.

<title>Rethinking the Family Meal</title>
<body>One of my great memories of growing up is the family meal and when I reached my teens, when all of us were gathered together again, a meal could last for hours as we told stories, discussed and debated.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a major proponent of the need for the family to gather at the table several times each week.&amp;nbsp; If anything depresses me, it&#39;s the loss of that shared experience.&amp;nbsp; But activities, sports and simple growing up are making me rethink some things.
The value of the family meal rests in the ability to keep tabs on what&#39;s going on in one another&#39;s lives.&amp;nbsp; As the kids move into the daily world with school, they need the opportunity to share and it&#39;s sometimes through simple storytelling that other indicators and issues are revealed.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve had to realize that Eldest is growing up and spending more time at sport practices and activities and she needs to eat something before her mother is home from work; the meal then becomes something rushed and eaten standing up as Youngest plays outside with a friend or watches television.&amp;nbsp; After she leaves, the routine has fallen apart and we&#39;ve all found ourselves eating away from the table.&amp;nbsp; I fear that the unspoken message being sent to the younger siblings is that the family traditions don&#39;t carry over for them, that Eldest has more inherent value than them and that we aren&#39;t a family unit without Eldest&#39;s presence.&amp;nbsp;
As I&#39;ve considered the situation, I recalled a comment that my father once made to my mother as my older sister prepared to leave for college.&amp;nbsp; Actually, it gives us the opportunity to spend more time concentrating on him.&amp;nbsp; Bearing that in mind, I think that several things will come into place.

    Even in the rush of the moment, there will no longer be any meals eaten while standing up or in front of the television.
    No child of any age will eat alone at a table but will be joined by either me or my wife.
    The table will be cleared of the crap and set appropriately so that none of the kids might think that they are an afterthought.

We have had some memorable meals of our own and I think that we will again.&amp;nbsp; But the tradition has to hold as the kids come and go.</body>

<title>Discipline:&nbsp; Reopening Closed Matters</title>
<body>Most kids are tangential storytellers and getting the full, coherent story is sometimes akin to trying to untangle the lines from three separate fishing rods.&amp;nbsp; When they&#39;re younger, it&#39;s a result of simple inability to keep their facts and timelines straight but when they&#39;re a bit older, it&#39;s more likely shading, omission or outright lying to avoid consequences.&amp;nbsp; My general practice is to find out everything that I can, make the decision and then move on.&amp;nbsp; But is anything truly closed?
The particulars are unimportant to this article, but it&#39;s sufficient to know that I thought that the matter was closed.&amp;nbsp; But at a recent&amp;nbsp;event, I came to learn additional facts that put the incident in another light; certain information was omitted by the child in the course of the interrogation.&amp;nbsp; I was going to say &amp;quot;investigation&amp;quot; but interrogation is really closer to the truth of the moment.&amp;nbsp; The new facts were unbidden and came pouring from another person&#39;s mouth and they were honestly horrified that they&#39;d spilled beans.&amp;nbsp; This person was correct in their realization that this was damning information.&amp;nbsp; So, do I reopen the matter and a probable can of worms?&amp;nbsp; Or do I let it go and remember to dig a bit deeper the next time?&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, the incident didn&#39;t involve any illegal activity or injury and in the great scheme, isn&#39;t actually that big of a deal.&amp;nbsp;
My expectation is that when this child returns from a trip with Mom, there&#39;ll be further discussion.&amp;nbsp; If for no other reason, I want the child to realize that there is no such thing as complete silence and that in the end, the parents will generally find out if they pay attention and follow&#45;up.&amp;nbsp; I also anticipate that there will actually be discipline involved &#45; the previous response was a discussion based upon the premise of a new situation with no real consequences &#45; just to reinforce that it&#39;s better to get the truth out there instead of covering it up.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll also have a discussion about omission being as damaging as commission.</body>

<title>Playing With The Kids:&nbsp; How Badly Do I Want To Win?</title>
<body>In any family, playing with the kids is something that generally goes to the father.&amp;nbsp; But do I ever let them win and if not, how competitive should I be?
Playing games is actually important for kids&#39; growth and development.&amp;nbsp; What are the rules and how do you follow them?&amp;nbsp; What happens when you don&#39;t follow the rules?&amp;nbsp; Can I really do this and win?&amp;nbsp; Hey, I really can do this!&amp;nbsp; Now what else can I do?&amp;nbsp; That is all part and parcel of exploration and maturing and it&#39;s part of my job as a father.&amp;nbsp; That fact that it&#39;s fun is simply icing on the cake.
I&#39;ve had a few guidelines on what and how I play with the kids.&amp;nbsp; First, make sure that it&#39;s an activity which provides them the opportunity to win if they play well.&amp;nbsp; For the smallest children, games of chance &#45; Candyland was a favorite &#45; gives the child an even chance to win even though he doesn&#39;t understand that there&#39;s no real game skill involved.&amp;nbsp; Second, if Junior wants to play something that requires skill &#45; think basketball &#45; then avoid actually playing for points and just work on the shooting and the other stuff.&amp;nbsp; Third, never throw a game so that Junior can actually feel some pride for having won on his own effort and talent.&amp;nbsp; While it sounds immensely old&#45;fashioned, knowing both that you can lose and how to lose really is character&#45;building.
But with the kids getting bigger and older, am I ever in a situation in which I purposefully turn up the heat to the point of embarrassing them?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the question I have now, especially in regards to one of the kids who made it a point of trash&#45;talking me while kicking the soccer ball around.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had a chronic leg problem for many years and it has affected my ability to physically play with the kids.&amp;nbsp; When I took Eldest to her soccer practice, Youngest came along and we kicked the ball since he&#39;s back in soccer after a baseball hiatus.&amp;nbsp; Because Youngest wants &#45; for some unfathomable reason &#45; to play goalie and have the ball aimed straight for his head, he took up a position and I began to shoot on him.&amp;nbsp; He did a creditable job and I began to shift the shots to either side so that he&#39;d have to dive.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If he bobbled the ball, I&#39;d rush in to finish the goal and force him to scramble to cover.&amp;nbsp; As he did well however, he grew cocky and began to talk smack and it was then that he shot off his mouth about my age and inability to &amp;quot;run with the big dogs&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; That was when I ignored his age and ratcheted up the power of the kicks, but to his credit he still did a decent job and stopped almost all of them.&amp;nbsp; As I reminded him when he shot off his mouth, he had better be able to &amp;quot;back the smack&amp;quot; that he was spewing on the field and in this case, he did.
What I&#39;m questioning now is whether to take the boy onto the basketball court to teach him some manners.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s routinely beaten there in games like &amp;quot;Horse&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Make it, Take it&amp;quot; by his elder siblings and I can outshoot the lad handily.&amp;nbsp;
But as I write this, I&#39;m deciding not to do that.&amp;nbsp; This is a kid who&#39;s found something that he can legitimately beat the old man at and if he shoots off his mouth, it&#39;s because he&#39;s starting to see himself in a position to compete more equally with elder siblings and a father who don&#39;t just let him win because he&#39;s the youngest.&amp;nbsp; Taking him onto the court to purposefully beat him would be simply wrong of me.&amp;nbsp; My initial response on the soccer field &#45; if you&#39;re gonna talk smack, you&#39;d better be able to back it &#45; was the best course and it&#39;ll be incumbent upon me to simply remind him of this before other games and practices.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m the adult, even when my own buttons are pushed.
And yes, I really didn&#39;t know what I&#39;d do when I sat down to write this article.&amp;nbsp; Thanks for listening.

<title>If You Give A Mouse A Cookie, v. 2</title>
<body>If you check on one of your kids before bed, you&#39;re liable to be told that they don&#39;t have any underwear for tomorrow.
If you ask whether they put it in the hamper, because you just did laundry and saw very little of it, you&#39;re liable to be told that they threw it away.
If you ask why in the hell they threw away their underwear, they&#39;re liable to say that it didn&#39;t fit anymore.
If you ask why in the hell didn&#39;t they tell you at a time when you could actually do something about it, they&#39;re liable to say that they forgot.
If you ask them to wear something small for tomorrow until you get replacements, they&#39;re liable to complain that it&#39;ll be uncomfortable and whine about why can&#39;t you go out to the 24 hour Walmart NOW to get it for them?
If you turn out the lights on them and proceed to say goodnight to another child, the other is liable to say that they overheard and by the way, his underwear is tight as well.
If you go the store the next day you realize that the two boys are similar enough in size that Medium is going to closely resemble Large and that if one of them gets the wrong size by mistake, he&#39;s liable to refuse to wear it.
If you return the wrongly stored underwear to the original owner, he&#39;s liable to complain that he won&#39;t wear underwear touched by his brother and will pitch a minor fit.
If you tell him to suck it up since it wasn&#39;t worn, he&#39;s liable to complain and whine about why can&#39;t you go to the 24 hour Walmart NOW to get a new pair?
If this continues, you decide to let them go to bed without any night&#45;time goodnights and checks and they&#39;re liable to complain about how uncaring you are.
If you then go back to&amp;nbsp;checking on the kids before bedtime,&amp;nbsp;you&#39;re liable to be told that they don&#39;t have any underwear for tomorrow.
Oy.

<title>Debt-Free U</title>
<body>I typically keep about four books going simultaneously and shift back and forth depending up my mood on any particular late night.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve put them aside as I work through Debt&#45;Free U by Zac Bissonnette.&amp;nbsp; The author, who is actually only about 21 years of age and working his way through the University of Massachusetts, writes knowingly of what he&#39;s learned about the college financing game and pushes the philosophy that what matters is the degree instead of the institution.
Bissonnette is a youth from a financially struggling family who decided to take his financial future into his own hands.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s had hard lessons that many young people haven&#39;t encountered and has developed a hard&#45;won ability to think critically, especially examining a higher education system that encourages debt assumption by youth and families who can&#39;t absorb that debtload.&amp;nbsp; Early in the book, he discusses the frequent practice of including with the college&#39;s financial aid package letter a suggestion that the student&#39;s parents can easily cover the funding shortfall by taking on additional debt for that amount.&amp;nbsp; The problem is that the letter is to the youth and leaves the parent in the position of being the bad guy.&amp;nbsp; As Bissonnette writes:
Who wants to be that guy?&amp;nbsp; No one, and the financial aid office knows that.&amp;nbsp; So they send a letter to the student suggesting that his parents borrow $24,000 with no collateral.&amp;nbsp; In 2004, the parents of 15.3 percent of graduating college seniors took out federal PLUS loans, carrying an average debt load of $17,709.
Of all the dirty tricks that financial aid offices play, this one irks me more than just about any other.&amp;nbsp; If you are going to suggest that someone borrow $24,000 per year for four years, you should send a letter to that person.&amp;nbsp; It is sneaky and unethical to send someone a letter suggesting that she try to convince another person to borrow up to $24,000 per year for four years.
The author writes with an easy authority that belies his youth and a viewpoint that many of my middle&#45;aged peers lack.&amp;nbsp; But instead of simply bemoaning how terrible things are, he lays out straightforward financial illustrations that bolster his contention that the key to a successful future isn&#39;t an Ivy League degree but rather, a fresh start with a new degree and the freedom of no debt.&amp;nbsp; It challenges long&#45;held assumptions about the value of public versus private institutions as well as the myths of community colleges &#45; which will&amp;nbsp;certainly be winners under the recently passed changes in the Federal Student Loan Program.&amp;nbsp; It also demonstrates a grasp of practical economic principles such as &amp;quot;opportunity costs&amp;quot;, which consider how resources can alternatively be used; the accumulated debt after college could instead be used for travel, a new car, a more satisfactory albeit lower&#45;paying job.&amp;nbsp; Above all, it demands that parents look honestly at&amp;nbsp;the situation and share&amp;nbsp;reality with their kids,&amp;nbsp;for whom they desperately want to provide and still shelter from the realities of adulthood.
I&#39;ve spoken at length with my oldest child about the need for higher education as well as the cost that it will bear.&amp;nbsp; As&amp;nbsp;she&#39;s looked at the amount in her 529&amp;nbsp;plan and compared that to the cost of&amp;nbsp;the institutions&amp;nbsp;already soliciting her attendance, the&amp;nbsp;financial discrepancy has dawned and she&#39;s&amp;nbsp;become aware of the financing&amp;nbsp;aspects.&amp;nbsp; She still has her dream school and truthfully, she&#39;s enough of a rocket scientist &#45; like her mother &#45; to potentially pull one of the&amp;nbsp;dozen full scholarships that that institution offers.&amp;nbsp; But while&amp;nbsp;that might be the&amp;nbsp;dream course, I&#39;ve already told her that she&#39;ll read&amp;nbsp;Bissonnette&#39;s book so that we can develop plans&amp;nbsp;B, C and D.
Bissonnette&#39;s book is truly worth the money spent and if you and your child make any changes in your plans, it will be a huge and lifetime return on the education investment.

<title>Bobblehead</title>
<body>Sometimes you see something and you know that it&#39;s going to coming to your house like something from a bad horror story.&amp;nbsp; The bobblehead will likely be coming to mine.
My wife works for a non&#45;profit hospice which holds a fund&#45;raising auction each Labor Day weekend.&amp;nbsp; This event started more than 25 years ago as a one&#45;day event which raised a few thousand dollars and has grown into a two day affair which last year grossed more than $335,000.&amp;nbsp; There are multiple buildings and tents for the different venues &#45; sports collectibles, hand&#45;made furniture, plants, new items/quilts, and the used stuff &#45; and dozens of volunteers and staff will work for a week to get the fairground site ready for the day.&amp;nbsp; Our kids have been literally raised with the event and all of us, except for Youngest, now volunteer in some way to help pull this off.&amp;nbsp;
The kids&#39; favorite destination is the used tent, full of thousands of donated items from attics, basements and bedrooms of long&#45;departed teens and it was from the latter that came the Bobblehead.&amp;nbsp; I spent two shifts in the used building, sorting the incoming items into various lots under the direction of an auctioneer and seasoned volunteer when I came across the Bobblehead.&amp;nbsp; It was from the band, Iron Maiden, and was a deformed oversized zombie&#39;s head on a skeletal mummified body that leaned forward to attack the owner.&amp;nbsp; The bobblehead apparently so scared the owner that it had never been removed from it&#39;s dusty, grimy clear plastic prison and it sat on the table bearing the original price tag, awaiting it&#39;s next owner before finally being consigned to the local landfill.&amp;nbsp; Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the Toy Story crew were never meant for the landfill but this guy was born for it.&amp;nbsp;
I looked at this thing and kiddingly asked &#45; well, almost kiddingly &#45; if I could trash the thing because it was so grotesque and odd.&amp;nbsp; Carol, the lead volunteer, laughed and reminded me that only if it was irreparably broken would we&amp;nbsp; toss it and that somebody somewhere would probably be willing to buy it.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, I thought, that somebody will be my middle kid.&amp;nbsp; Middle is 13 and has discovered the joys of rock music and has managed to explore the realms of Rock&amp;nbsp;ranging from mainstream Pop to the fringes of Punk Ska and the crevices of Swedish Death Metal.&amp;nbsp; Like his peers, he thinks that heavy metal bands who sing of rebellion and sticking it to the man are on the fringe of mind&#45;altering revolution but it hasn&#39;t sunk in that they&#39;re now guys older than me who are hocking their guitars on Pawn Star and worried about their IRAs and fiber content.&amp;nbsp; I nodded in resigned agreement and placed it&amp;nbsp;in a box with a few other items for the lot, one of which was a remote&#45;controlled car without the remote because hey, they&#39;re innocuous enough that somebody somewhere probably has a remote.&amp;nbsp; My only hedge was to assure that the height of the containing box was taller than the bobblehead so that it didn&#39;t stand out like the pimple on the Prom Queen&#39;s forehead.
Yesterday, Middle went with me to drop off a friend&#39;s kitchen table for the auction and after we&#39;d unloaded and placed it, Middle took a quick cruise through the used building.&amp;nbsp; I suddenly heard his voice from the distance yelling that This is cool!&amp;nbsp; I love Iron Maiden!&amp;nbsp; Dad, can I get this?&amp;nbsp; This thing is awesome, dude!&amp;nbsp; I strolled over and found the Bobblehead in his hands, reaching for Middle as a baby reaches for Daddy to be picked up.&amp;nbsp; I looked at the thing and then my son and responded that he could bid on it but that it would be his coin on this one.&amp;nbsp; He nodded and asked that if he was working when it went on the block if I&#39;d bid for it for him.&amp;nbsp; Damn.
It&#39;s ugly and serves no purpose.&amp;nbsp; But then again, neither did the poster on the wall of childhood room or the Aurora model of the Frankenstein on my shelf.
Yep, Bobblehead&#39;s comin&#39; home.</body>

<title>Should I Use Home Equity To Help Pay For College?</title>
<body>With my eldest child just a few years away from college and two more in the pipeline at intervals behind, I wonder how we&#39;re going to help the kids pay for higher education.&amp;nbsp; Just how much do I/should I pay for their higher education?
Though all of my thinking however, it never occurred to me to use my home&#39;s equity to pay for the education.&amp;nbsp; I know others who&#39;ve done it and they now find themselves in their fifties with two mortgages on their home, but that option simply never entered my calculations.&amp;nbsp; The extent to which it&#39;s been done &#45; and the effect that it&#39;s&amp;nbsp;had on education rates &#45; was surprisingly brought home in a recent Wall Street Journal article, Housing Bust Makes Paying For College Harder.&amp;nbsp;
The article&#39;s gist is that a significant portion of the tuition payments are being made by parents who are borrowing against the equity in their home and unfortunately, the decline in housing values means that that financing mechanism is being shut down.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case in which lower wealth families &#45; those with income less than $65,000 and what they define as &amp;quot;housing wealth&amp;quot; less than $125,000 &#45; have used the home ATM for education.&amp;nbsp; A study noted that for each $10K rise in &amp;quot;housing wealth&amp;quot;, which I assume to mean equity, in the four years prior to the child&#39;s college age for a family in this stratum meant that there was more than a 6% likelihood of that child attending college.&amp;nbsp; With housing values declining and mortgage lenders cutting back on second mortgages, the fear of the study&#39;s authors is that this will create a significant loss of higher&#45;trained, college educated workers for the labor force.
Huh?&amp;nbsp;
This is one of the reasons that I don&#39;t particularly care for social scientists since they focus on the academic, ignore the human side of the equation and help perpetuate a con.&amp;nbsp; The verbal sleight of hand is that companies want a labor force that&#39;s competitive with the global population and there&#39;s truth that many of our students are behind the curve.&amp;nbsp; But when I follow the business news and announcements, the real value&#45;added jobs are being sent overseas because the cost of labor is significantly cheaper and rarely do&amp;nbsp;I see that it&#39;s because Frank can&#39;t add as well as Rashid and Jagdish.&amp;nbsp;
The expectation of the past several generations is that the parents pay to educate the children, and my guilt exists because that&#39;s what my own parents did for me.&amp;nbsp; But the economic environment has changed dramatically.&amp;nbsp; Our parents and grandparents&amp;nbsp;owned their home free&#45;and&#45;clear for their dotage, our generation faces the senior years with the prospect of having to continue paying for housing with far less money to pay for that housing.&amp;nbsp; And with stagnant or declining incomes, the burden on our own children will be increased.&amp;nbsp; Yes, their student debt &#45; a toxic debt if ever there was one &#45; will be minimized while I can deduct the interest payments, but I truly don&#39;t want to spend my senior years being financially dependent on my children.&amp;nbsp; It does hearken back to past generations in our history when families were multi&#45;generational with kids tended to by grandparents, but it&#39;s not something that we necessarily want to pursue.
I can&#39;t speak for my wife but I&#39;m truly uncertain about how far to take the financing aspect.&amp;nbsp; My sense is that it will be a possibility but one contingent upon the child/student; if we haven&#39;t seen you put out to get the grades necessary to compete, then we won&#39;t put out the money for more than the standard college degree.&amp;nbsp; But regardless of the decision, it will be weighted down with emotional baggage that will linger long after they&#39;re out.

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s Shopping For School Clothing and Supplies</title>
<body>There was an office supply store commercial several years ago that showed glum children shopping for school supplies while their father rode on the shopping cart with the Xmas tune It&#39;s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year playing on the soundtrack.&amp;nbsp; Spend significant amounts of time with kids in the summer and you&#39;re liable to agree with this assessment.&amp;nbsp; But before you can get to that point, you have to perform some true drudgery in getting ready for that first day.&amp;nbsp; You can walk into the store and start spending, or you can actually save some money by planning ahead on what you need and that&#39;s the drudgery.
School shopping&amp;nbsp;consists of two parts&amp;nbsp;&#45; the paper and school supplies themselves, and then the dreaded clothing.&amp;nbsp; The school supplies are relatively easy since the materials generally don&#39;t change from one year to the next and you can actually stock up on really good sales, keeping the materials stored for years while you slowly exhaust them.&amp;nbsp; But the tricky part is outfitting your child&#39;s clothing because of growth, and in the case of many girls, fashion changes.&amp;nbsp;
School Supplies
Various stores will start rolling out the back&#45;to&#45;school sales in the first week of August and there will be all manner of stuff available.&amp;nbsp; Some will even run super specials with items for the dime during a specified period and it&#39;s tempting to run in and then pat yourself on the back for all of your savings.&amp;nbsp; But there are several things to consider.

    Just because school supplies are for sale doesn&#39;t mean that your child(ren) will necessarily need those particular school supplies.&amp;nbsp; You might see all manner of items in the Sunday circulars and some office supply stores will even have generic lists available of what items are required for different grades in a particular school district.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that there can be variances within school districts and even amongst teachers.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been burned on several occasions and at the elementary school level, now wait for the introductory letter from the teacher to see what he or she wants our child to bring.&amp;nbsp; Some things are a given, such as backpacks and crayons, but there can be differences.
    If there&#39;s a great sale on truly utilitarian items &#45; yellow high&#45;lighters and lined notebook paper, for instance &#45; then consider buying in quantity and then storing them until they&#39;re finally exhausted.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve got reams of notebook paper, two pocket folders and highlighters in the basement and just feed off of them.&amp;nbsp; But be sure to take stock of what&#39;s in storage before spending money needlessly.
    When you get the items home, sequester them so that excitable kids don&#39;t disperse them all over hell and half of Georgia.
    Pay attention to the receipts, especially if there&#39;s an item on it that can be rebated.&amp;nbsp; This is where women have it over on men since they&#39;re able to get away with purses; I&#39;m able to bend gender roles in multiple shapes as the need arises but I&#39;m not going to spend my time correcting people that I&#39;m carrying a satchel and not a man&#45;purse.&amp;nbsp; Thank you very much.

School Clothing

    Before you even worry about shopping, ascertain what clothing you already have and that&#39;s especially the case if you&#39;re using hand&#45;me&#45;down clothing from others.&amp;nbsp; With two boys, we have plenty of clothing from friends flowing through the house and it&#39;s made a significant dent in the clothes spending.&amp;nbsp; That means that you&#39;ll have to physically cull through the clothing articles and dispose of obviously small items while setting aside others to be tried on.&amp;nbsp; Once that&#39;s done, then you know what you&#39;ll need.
    Have a sense of what the school&#39;s clothing policy is so that you can eliminate needless argument from the child or teen.&amp;nbsp; If your kid attends a school with a uniform policy, you&#39;re golden in that regards.&amp;nbsp;
    Be prepared to spend the better part of a day in shopping for clothing.&amp;nbsp; If your kids are younger, be prepared to break the shopping into several separate increments.&amp;nbsp; In our case, we wrap the shopping into other events that keep it tolerable for the kids &#45; lunch at the food court, browsing at the book store or a stop at the music/video store.
    If time is an issue &#45; as we were shopping for Youngest&#39;s blue jeans while Eldest was at soccer &#45; then simply purchase clothing of the size needed and then try it on at home.&amp;nbsp; In Youngest&#39;s case, he knows that he&#39;ll try on jeans after school and I&#39;ll return it tomorrow night for a refund.&amp;nbsp; Stores are willing to let people take things home to try on and return provided the tags and receipt are presented at return.&amp;nbsp; Again, keep the receipt.&amp;nbsp; If your mate can keep a grocery receipt in her purse for nine months, then you can keep the thing for a few days.&amp;nbsp; And DO NOT remove any of the labels or the items will be unreturnable.
    Be ready for commentary from the kids as they age.&amp;nbsp; I was surprised to find that kids in elementary school are concerned about whether they&#39;re perceived as wearing tighty&#45;whities&amp;nbsp; and granny pants.&amp;nbsp; It makes things stressful but it can be entertaining as they age and you see where their tastes lie.

Preparing for school isn&#39;t a spur&#45;of&#45;the&#45;moment thing but if you consider what you&#39;re doing, that time spent doesn&#39;t have to be miserable either.
And for Pete&#39;s sake, don&#39;t lose the receipt.</body>

<title>A Father&#8217;s Thoughts on Bullies</title>
<body>As a father, I&#39;ve been concerned with how schools manage the issue of bullying.&amp;nbsp; The school system and I agree that bullying is wrong and we likewise agree that it shouldn&#39;t be tolerated.&amp;nbsp; We even agree that the first response of a child being bullied shouldn&#39;t just be to haul off and smack the problem child.&amp;nbsp; But where we disagree iswhether a child has any right to self&#45;defense.&amp;nbsp; Is there a point at which achild can actually stand up for himself when the other avenues have failed?
We&#39;ve taught our three children that they&#39;re to do three things if they feel they&#39;re being bullied.&amp;nbsp; First, tell the kid to stop doing whatever&#39;s creating the problem.&amp;nbsp; Second, simply walk away.&amp;nbsp; If the first two steps fail, then find and tell someone in authority.&amp;nbsp; Many of these instances occur in places where there is adult control and it&#39;s the adults&#39; responsibility to prevent these problems.&amp;nbsp; Schools are particularly sensitive to the issue and will actively take measures to monitor, control and discipline kids who bully.
Unfortunately, adults aren&#39;t always around.
I was raised with the understanding that you might have to fight back.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve taught our kids that if the three avoidance steps fail, they should defend themselves.&amp;nbsp; So I was surprised some years ago to hear that the elementary school guidance counselor had asked my son&#39;s class this question:&amp;nbsp; How many of your parents have said that it&#39;s okay to fight back if you&#39;re being bullied?&amp;nbsp; My son and several classmates raised their hands.&amp;nbsp; Your parents are wrong.&amp;nbsp; If anybody is caught throwing punches or kicking somebody, even a bully, they&#39;ll be punished the same as the person they say&amp;nbsp;is bullying them.&amp;nbsp; One of the kids asked what would happen if they were outnumbered with their backs to the wall and had no choice?&amp;nbsp; The response was the same.&amp;nbsp; The counselor did provide the class with strategies that could be used if they were being bullied but the kids were left scratching their heads.&amp;nbsp; This, along with a comment that was wildly misconstrued by my son, led to a phone call to determine what was said and in this instance, the counselor&#39;s original question was indeed correct.
I understand the situation in which schools find themselves.&amp;nbsp; Society&#39;s violence level has spilled into schools and what we settled with fists is now handled with weapons.&amp;nbsp; If a child denies being a bully to the parents, today&#39;s parents are more likely to support them even at the threat of litigation.&amp;nbsp; Combine these factors and school systems simply find it easier to adopt a zero&#45;tolerance policy that punishes all equally, regardless of guilt or circumstances.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the juvenile equivalent of the&amp;nbsp;Second Amendment argument that when all guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.
So what can you do?&amp;nbsp; A bully will take over a child&#39;s life and the bully must be handled one way or another.&amp;nbsp; Our kids have had to contend with multiple bullies, including a troubled first&#45;grader who actually contracted with a fourth&#45;grader to attack and beat up my first grade son.&amp;nbsp; In that instance, our son immediately went to the playground aide and all three wound up in the principal&#39;s office to settle the matter.

    First, pay attention and decide whether or not there is a bullying problem.&amp;nbsp; Some kids will share it but others will hide the situation. Learn the signs of bullying.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, listen to the names that get thrown around by the kids and the context in which you&#39;re hearing them and then take an opportunity to visit the school, even if it means taking time out of work.
    Second, find out your school system&#39;s policy on bullying.&amp;nbsp; How do they address cases of bullying?
    Third, if you think that your child has a problem, contact the school and speak with the teacher and principal.&amp;nbsp; To their credit, they will take it seriously and listen.&amp;nbsp; Tell them what you&#39;re hearing and ask what they know.&amp;nbsp; What about the suspected child or children?&amp;nbsp; Any other issues?&amp;nbsp; Ask them to investigate and give them an opportunity to respond.&amp;nbsp; When the teacher knows that there&#39;s a problem, you&#39;ll generally have a respite window as greater attention is paid.&amp;nbsp;
    Fourth, follow up quickly and work out an action plan.&amp;nbsp; Then share it with your child and pay attention.&amp;nbsp; If the bullying continues, follow up with the school again.&amp;nbsp; Delegate upwards if the problem persists.
    If the situation does continue, decide what your response is.&amp;nbsp; In our case, a bully took over our other son&#39;s second grade year and despite multiple conversations with the teacher and the bully&#39;s mother &#45; Dad wasn&#39;t around &#45; the problems continued.&amp;nbsp; After our son was bullied again, I simply told the principal that my son would defend himself accordingly.&amp;nbsp; The bullying did decrease afterwards and I then made it a point to share with other teachers and principals &#45; when the need arose &#45; that my kids had the option to defend themselves if the adults didn&#39;t resolve the problem.&amp;nbsp; My wife and I made a conscious decision &#45; and shared it with the kids &#45; that if all other approaches failed, we&#39;d back them if they got in trouble for fighting.

There might be consequences at school, but we&#39;d work with it and they&#39;d have no consequences with us.&amp;nbsp; Because when the kids are adults,they will have to manage these issues themselves.

<title>Does My Kid Need Deodorant Already?</title>
<body>When people discuss puberty, it might come across as almost an overnight event &#45; girls have their first period and develop breasts while boys have two days of cracked voices and then spend the next two years in the bathroom.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that puberty is a lengthy process that comes on gradually and lasts for years.&amp;nbsp; While it generally starts full bore in the early teens, there is no definitive time that it begins for any particular person and some will begin much earlier while a few start at an older age.&amp;nbsp; However, one of the common precursors to puberty is the onset of body odor and that should serve as notice as your child&#39;s body is starting the road to Puberty.
Children can sweat when they&#39;re very little, but body odor is a result of activation and increase in the sweat glands as the child&#39;s body chemistry starts to morph.&amp;nbsp; You might finally note a discernible body odor after active play or at the end of the day and if it is, then it&#39;s likely that your child is near time for a deodorant.&amp;nbsp; If you want to verify whether there&#39;s actual body odor, simply take a quick sniff of the dirty shirts in the laundry; it might sound rude but that&#39;s all part of parenthood.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t necessary to sniff their pits and not the least bit helpful to make smartmouth remarks about it; kids are exquisitely concerned with their social status and anything that indicates that they&#39;ll be unpopular or the potential butt of jokes is more frightening than a Wes Craven film.
If you think that body odor is now going to become an issue, then there are several things to consider.

    Is your child unaware of it and regardless, how do you wish to broach the issue?&amp;nbsp; Kids can fear anything that threatens their social status and when you discuss it, play up the fact that this is all part of the process of changing from child to adult.&amp;nbsp; You can also reassure them that there are things that can be done to manage things so that it isn&#39;t an issue.
    If there are other concerns, such as a very early onset of odor, certainly contact your family physician and schedule a&amp;nbsp;checkup.&amp;nbsp; While it&#39;s not common, there are occasionally other circumstances that are the catalyst for body odor.
    Can the issue be addressed simply by more&amp;nbsp;thorough bathing or have you moved into the realm of products that mask or control the odor?
    If your child is going to need a personal hygiene product, do you want it to be an antiperspirant or a deodorant?&amp;nbsp; The two aren&#39;t the same as each approaches the issue of body odor from a different perspective.&amp;nbsp; An antiperspirant actually contains chemicals in the formulary that serve to block the pores through which sweat comes so that if there is no sweating, there isn&#39;t any odor.&amp;nbsp; A deodorant serves to control the odor by having antiseptic compounds in the formulary that kill the bacteria that can cause the odor; a deodorant doesn&#39;t actually block the pores.
    A child&#39;s body can have the same allergic reaction to an unfamiliar&amp;nbsp;deodorant or antiperspirant as a new food&amp;nbsp;for an infant or toddler.&amp;nbsp; Be aware of complaints about itching or pain after it&#39;s first used and consider taking some looks for visible skin changes at or&amp;nbsp;around the areas being treated.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Start the process first&amp;nbsp;by using&amp;nbsp;a product that doesn&#39;t have any fragrance, whether it&#39;s a mass market product that&#39;s unscented or a product that is touted as natural or organic.&amp;nbsp; If there are&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;problems and your child wants it&amp;nbsp;&#45; and you allow it &#45; then&amp;nbsp;you can move on to the scented products.&amp;nbsp;
    If your child is using a scented product, expect to have to educate the kid about the appropriate amount of deodorant to use.&amp;nbsp; Kids typically have no calibration for anything and things are either all or none, so your house is liable to smell like Axe until things are brought under control.&amp;nbsp; In our case, my wife entered our house through the front door and immediately walked out same door because of the reek of Axe deodorant wafting from Middle&#39;s bedroom.&amp;nbsp; Our son decided to treat all of his clothing by spraying his drawers and closet with the Axe body spray and it took days for his room to clear the smell.

Dealing&amp;nbsp;with body odor is like any other&amp;nbsp;bodily function issue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s neither gross nor is it a magical precursor to be celebrated as a marker to adulthood.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But it is an&amp;nbsp;early indicator that your child is developing and a clue to start looking for other signs of pubescence.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Staying Near the Sick Kid</title>
<body>You&#39;ve got a full slate of things to do and many of them are outside&amp;nbsp;when one of the kids suddenly becomes ill.&amp;nbsp; He lies down in bed, but do you still go outside to work in the yard?
That&#39;s the situation facing me now and frankly, I&#39;ll chuck the outside work and leave it go until later.&amp;nbsp; Yes, there&#39;s always the baby monitor if the child is smaller and God knows that I used it.&amp;nbsp; But when the child is sick &#45; even if only sleeping &#45; I&#39;d rather forego the&amp;nbsp;monitor and just stay close.&amp;nbsp; Kids will come to physically need you less and less as they age, and this sick one is a young teen, but there&#39;s still the child&#39;s sense of knowing that he&#39;s not alone.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, if there&#39;s nausea and vomiting involved, I believe that kids do feel better knowing that someone&#39;s there to help.&amp;nbsp; And in the worst case scenario, I&#39;m nearby in the event of a real emergency and can respond immediately.&amp;nbsp; The other aspect is my own peace of mind knowing that I wasn&#39;t unattentive in the event of trouble.
So instead, I&#39;ll take some moments to write and put off the outdoor work until later.</body>

<title>This Father&#8217;s Fear</title>
<body>All fathers have and must contend with fear&amp;nbsp;and it varies from one to another.&amp;nbsp; Will my child be assaulted or kidnapped?&amp;nbsp; Will her current crop of friends lead to trouble down the road?&amp;nbsp; How am I going to afford college and still have some money set aside for my own old age?&amp;nbsp; What do I owe my children versus myself?
I&#39;ve considered all of these questions at one time or another, but the fear that truly haunts me doesn&#39;t pertain to my children&#39;s present, but actually their future.&amp;nbsp; Anybody with half a lick of sense knows that things with America simply aren&#39;t right at the moment.&amp;nbsp; Yet&amp;nbsp;I know enough of national and family history to know that bad times come but then are replaced with better times.&amp;nbsp; I know that my maternal great&#45;great&#45;great grandfather survived the entire Civil War &#45; and Gettysburg &#45; without a scratch.&amp;nbsp; I know that two great uncles survived the trenches of the First World War and their mother died of sepsis from a hand cut in the kitchen.&amp;nbsp; My own parents were both children of the Great Depression and both my uncle and father served in &#45; and were actively shot at &#45; in two separate wars.
Bad times come.&amp;nbsp; Bad times go.&amp;nbsp; There was usually a sense during those days and years of fear that there would again be something of value and hope if things could be seen through to their conclusion.&amp;nbsp; Peace, prosperity, real hope and not the faux kind peddled by various politicians &#45; of both parties.
But I fear that my children face a future in which bad times come, and then stay.&amp;nbsp; That if decisions aren&#39;t made and appropriate policies followed, that they will have no opportunity to live with the possibility of betterment and advancement for themselves and their children.&amp;nbsp; And the data of the past two or more decades shows that the income disparities between folks have become so marked that there is the real risk of a permanent underclass and a gutted middle&#45;class at the mercy of an oligarchy that rules for itself.&amp;nbsp;
This was brought forcefully home in an article entitled Who Rules America?&amp;nbsp; The article is lengthy, detailed and the numbers and charts leave little room for doubt.&amp;nbsp; While there has been much written about income disparity, the synopsis presented shows that the wealth in the past two decades has shifted markedly to the wealthy so that the top 1% of the wage&#45;earners possess a vastly disproportionate amount of the wealth.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not a conspiracy theorist that believes that a secret cabal planned all of this in 1977, but I do believe that there are some exceptionally astute people who realized the implications of certain policies and then hi&#45;jacked these to their own ends.&amp;nbsp; Changes in lobbying standards?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s exploit them.&amp;nbsp; Changes in financial regulations?&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s exploit them.&amp;nbsp; The failure of the government to actively monitor and pursue those who broke or manipulated the law led to a period of laissez&#45;faire on steroids in which anything has occurred and will continue to do so.
And the super&#45;wealthy, who aren&#39;t stupid and are able to employ even smarter consultants, understand this and will advance themselves at the expense of the common wealth.
So what do I do apart from rail at the television and listen to Glenn Beck?

    Spend more time examining the internet and exploring alternative information sources.&amp;nbsp; Lurk and watch and determine what is legitimate versus on&#45;the&#45;fringe and then pass this information along to your neighbors.
    Ask whether a proposed policy or solution benefits all or really only a few?&amp;nbsp; For instance, who truly benefits from an extension of the Bush tax cuts?&amp;nbsp; Is their extension going to set the stage for a stable economic future?
    Actually call or write your Congressman, as simplistic as that sounds.&amp;nbsp; They do pay attention to numbers and respond to the varying windspeeds because that&#39;s what politicians do, unfortunately.
    Make sure that you talk to your kids about the world around them and fill them in, even if in small doses.&amp;nbsp; If that means that you have to physically have to turn off the various electronic devices, then do so and talk.&amp;nbsp; Some of my best moments are in the car or at the dinner table when there&#39;s no screen to distract them.
    Spend time discussing money with your kids and help them learn good habits.&amp;nbsp; There are some things that we do poorly here and some other things that we do extraordinarily well.&amp;nbsp;
    Re&#45;examine your own personal and family views on consumerism/materialism.&amp;nbsp; Do you really need to purchase something that was in all probability made in China?&amp;nbsp; Do you really need to have the newest car?&amp;nbsp; Can you get by happily with less?&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t buy the lie that spending money will help America if most of that money goes to high&#45;end items that are simply made by foreign workers.
    Ride&amp;nbsp;kids on their grades and make that a fight if necessary.&amp;nbsp; With three kids, I understand that not everybody wants to study; but that is a fight in which I will routinely engage just because it has to happen.
    Stop accepting things at face value just because Limbaugh, Beck and Franken say that it&#39;s so.&amp;nbsp; Understand that these outlets thrive on debate and conflict and will continue to encourage it because it&#39;s profitable.
    In short, question and examine and then press.&amp;nbsp; Press the politicians and the economists.&amp;nbsp; Press the children and above all else, press yourselves.

There is unfortunately no easy way out of what&#39;s upon us.&amp;nbsp; There will be painful sacrifices and considerable angst and economic pain before things are finally settled and I suspect that there will be civil turmoil.&amp;nbsp; Long&#45;held economic/financial strategies will be overturned.&amp;nbsp; But I take heart in recognizing that my forefathers have been in the same position and so far, nobody&#39;s shooting at me.
For the record, I think that Glenn Beck is a truly funny guy and I even agree with him sometimes.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;m not planning my future based upon his musings and rallies and I no longer listen on a regular basis.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s too much else to do.</body>

<title>PracticalDad and Vacation</title>
<body>Family vacations change with the family as it ages and changes.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s less obvious work for the parent as kids no longer need to be diapered or constantly watched, but the stress doesn&#39;t completely depart.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The kids now have some of their own interests that compete for family time but still haven&#39;t fully developed the sense that their interest isn&#39;t necessarily the most important.&amp;nbsp; And there&#39;s some friction as they think that they&#39;re ready for more than a father thinks that they can handle.&amp;nbsp; The family vacation is a work in progress, evolving with the kids and their growing bodies and interests.
So what are some notes that I made during the past 10 days?

    Invest in an Auto FM Transmitter that connects an iPod or mp3 to the car stereo for everyone to hear.&amp;nbsp; Kids have the capacity &#45; especially as they reach the teens &#45; to download an enormous amount of material and many are actually willing to play it for you.&amp;nbsp; In our case, Eldest, Middle and I each played two selections from our respective devices with the caveat that they had to be appropriate for younger ears and middle&#45;aged sensibilities.&amp;nbsp; We consequently heard everything from Don McLean&#39;s Miss American Pie&amp;nbsp; to Psychostick&#39;s This Is Not A Song, It&#39;s A Sandwich and Glee&#39;s cover of Queen&#39;s Somebody to Love.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&#39;m continually surprised at the&amp;nbsp;variety of music that&#39;s&amp;nbsp;shown up and that&#39;s surprised in a mostly good way.
    We&amp;nbsp;usually travel with another family whose kids are roughly the same age and our Eldest kids are old enough to do some gallivanting on their own.&amp;nbsp; Naturally, Youngest wants to tag along and we&#39;ve been&amp;nbsp;fortunate&amp;nbsp;that our combined six kids mesh well together and are willing to be responsible for Youngest.&amp;nbsp; That said, we try&amp;nbsp;to give the&amp;nbsp;elder kids some freedom without the responsibility of monitoring a youngster and set aside concentrated time to keep Youngest occupied.&amp;nbsp; When Youngest does move with the older kids, we are explicit with them that he&#39;s with them and&amp;nbsp;they are now responsible so that&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;can avoid an episode of finger&#45;pointing about a lost child.&amp;nbsp; Even so, there were&amp;nbsp;several minutes at Monticello when the older kids split up and didn&#39;t verify who had the boy, leading to a PracticalDad wandering the Dependencies at Monticello and working the cellphone furiously.
    I&amp;nbsp;no longer hit them with all manner of details about what we&#39;re going to see but now concentrate on&amp;nbsp;what I consider to&amp;nbsp;be of the greatest importance that they should&amp;nbsp;know.&amp;nbsp; Most kids don&#39;t give a rats butt about history and the effects of the French Revolution on Jefferson&#39;s architecture; that will hopefully come with time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But I do try to&amp;nbsp;give them enough to have a perspective on what they&#39;ll see.&amp;nbsp; In our case, I&amp;nbsp;wanted the kids to understand that the Skyline Drive in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia was actually a jobs program in the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Why would men live out in the wilderness to build this?&amp;nbsp; Weren&#39;t they bored?&amp;nbsp; No &#45; they needed a job and sent the money home to support their families.&amp;nbsp; It will vary with the family, but too much information and they&#39;ll get the 1000 yard stare.
    Surprisingly, you still have to monitor discipline and that&#39;s&amp;nbsp;especially the case with teenage boys.&amp;nbsp; Get several teens together and the tendency will be to insulate themselves from the outside so that they&#39;re not&amp;nbsp;paying attention to others around them.&amp;nbsp; Texting will occur in inappropriate places and horseplay will erupt around Senior Citizens who can&#39;t afford to get knocked over and it will continue to be an ongoing responsibility for a parent.
    Understand that&amp;nbsp; the kids will still continue to feed off of one another and the idiocy quotient can reach astounding levels.&amp;nbsp; I frankly enjoy them now more than before and that&#39;s perhaps because I realize that the family vacations with all of the kids present are now numbered.&amp;nbsp; Before, there was no governor on the kids&#39; collective engine and I felt compelled to provide one but now, let them revel in their goofiness and enjoy it for what it is.

No two vacations are the same and some will be long remembered while others will quickly be forgotten.&amp;nbsp; Your approach to them will help set the tone for the category that the kids choose.</body>

<title>Do You Write the Site or Does the Site Write You?</title>
<body>There&#39;s a recent saying that you don&#39;t write a blog, but rather, the blog writes you.&amp;nbsp; My goal has been to post regularly, if not daily, and not turn out anything resembling dreck and I&#39;ve been successful &#45; in production at least &#45; for the past two years.&amp;nbsp; But three kids make you busy and it&#39;s been that.
I apologize for the recent inactivity &#45; nobody&#39;s died, although I&#39;ve been tempted on two occasions recently &#45; and when things quiet down, will get back to writing as expeditiously as possible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I plan however, to resume my regular articles&amp;nbsp;in about a week.&amp;nbsp; Until then, keep the electronics under control and say no to your kids regularly.
All the best,

<title>When Should Kids Start to Concentrate On One Sport?</title>
<body>There are any number of sports opportunities available for kids to choose, far more than were available than when I was a kid.&amp;nbsp; Baseball, football and basketball are now joined by soccer, lacrosse, volleyball, field hockey.&amp;nbsp; This is further complicated by the option to play at various levels that range from rec league to travel and premier for the most committed players.&amp;nbsp; The question that my wife and I ask ourselves is at what point we finally tell the kids that they have to finally concentrate on one sport instead of just letting them play a number of them?
It&#39;s a family decision and the answer will vary accordingly.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, some will read this and probably think that I&#39;m full of crap and that&#39;s fine.&amp;nbsp; But what are some of the things that we consider when talking about kids and sports?

    First, if the kid wants to play multiple sports, are they in the same season?&amp;nbsp; Soccer in our area is played both Fall and Spring, so it&#39;s concurrent with both Football and Baseball.&amp;nbsp; Our philosophy has been that if the sport options play and practice simultaneously, the child will have to make a choice.&amp;nbsp; When the kid splits sports in one season, there&#39;s a real possibility that practices and/or games will overlap and the kid won&#39;t be able to make a full commitment to either sport.&amp;nbsp; There are multiple reasons to compete in a sport and frankly, one of them is to win.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s important to learn teamwork and cooperation and it&#39;s especially important to have fun.&amp;nbsp; But most kids do want to be on a winning team and it&#39;s simply not fair to the rest if a team member isn&#39;t making all of the practices but still expects to play.
    Second, at what level does the kid want to compete?&amp;nbsp; Eldest played for a season at a travel team level and decided that rec league&#39;s more to her liking; if she&#39;s happy playing multiple sports at a more relaxed level, then we&#39;re fine with that.
    Third, how old is the child?&amp;nbsp; The demands of some sports and coaches are rigorous and it can frankly burn out a child.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a shame to see a child grow to hate a sport because of the demands on a child not yet ready to accept them.
    Fourth, what&#39;s the impact on the remainder of the family?&amp;nbsp; Middle asked on multiple occasions &#45; which is one of my criteria to ascertain the seriousness of a kid&#39;s idea &#45; to take up Fencing.&amp;nbsp; To give fair due, he&#39;s a wiry teen with physical grace, flexibility and quick reflexes.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s even a local instructor who competed with the national Soviet team in the 1970s/1980s.&amp;nbsp; However, the competitions will frequently be out of the area and we&#39;re unwilling to commit that kind of time to competitions in other states.

&amp;nbsp;Youngest has been clear that he wants to play baseball for the local high school team, which has a history of winning seasons and championships.&amp;nbsp; If he persists in this desire, we&#39;ll support him; but at his young age, we&#39;re going to let him play other sports until he&#39;s old enough to better understand the demands that serious competition makes.</body>

<title>Spending Time On the Cheap</title>
<body>Like everybody else, we&#39;re cutting back and deleveraging, which is financial&#45;speak for paying down debt.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re acutely aware that on top of the mortgage, there are three kids to educate and each of our vans has racked up more than 95,000 miles.&amp;nbsp; I regularly talk to the kids about money and they know that we&#39;re ratcheting down the spending.&amp;nbsp; But does that mean that they have to feel poor?
What are some of the things that I&#39;ve recently done with one or more kids to pass the time?

    Travel several miles to a small river bridge and explore the circa 1830 canal locks, and then explain what a canal is in the first place.
    Throw a baseball, followed by a football.
    Throw a baseball that&#39;s been recovered from plant beds that we&#39;re tearing out to relandscape.
    Watch a lightning storm from the safety of the front porch and debate whether thunder is caused by the lightning itself or the clash of warm and cold air (it&#39;s the latter per my wife, the rocket scientist),
    Take one or&amp;nbsp;more kids to the community pool.&amp;nbsp; While membership isn&#39;t free, it costs $200/year for a family of four and if three kids spend 30 days at the pool, then the cost of entertaining each child drops to an average of $2.22 per day.&amp;nbsp; The more that you go, the cheaper is the average daily cost&amp;nbsp;and if you throw in some snacks from Costco, you&#39;ve got a cheap day of entertainment.
    Spend an evening just reading, either each within his or her own book or aloud to one another.&amp;nbsp; Tonight, we started with Treasure Island.
    Let the kids invite friends over to spend the evening watching DVDs and eating snacks.
    Teach the kids how to make a favorite food.&amp;nbsp; My wife spent time this evening teaching Middle how to make egg salad from start to finish.&amp;nbsp; The other day, Eldest made brownies while I cut up fruit.
    Take&amp;nbsp;one or more kids on a bike ride around the neighborhood to familiarize them with&amp;nbsp;road rules for bicycles.
    Wrestle in the grass.
    Shoot basketball.
    Watch&amp;nbsp;different TV shows on different nights.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve come to enjoy&amp;nbsp;Pawn Stars&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;American Pickers&amp;nbsp;while my wife and several of the kids gather around&amp;nbsp;any&amp;nbsp;Food Network show.
    Explain where babies come from and how women don&#39;t have&amp;nbsp;to sit on their eggs after they&#39;re fertilized.
    Give a probie slap to the child who told Youngest that women have to sit on their fertilized eggs in order for the babies to hatch.
    Take a walk with the&amp;nbsp;family and dog, not forgetting the plastic&amp;nbsp;grocery bag for dog poop.
    Give a probie slap to the child&amp;nbsp;who told Youngest that&amp;nbsp;when people recycle their plastic grocery bags, they&#39;re all filled with dog&amp;nbsp;poop.

We&#39;re not going cold turkey with spending since we still got&amp;nbsp;a few books from Borders and took a recent trip, but we are emphasizing that things don&#39;t have to have a price tag attached to be enjoyable.&amp;nbsp; And we&#39;ll continue to deleverage despite what the economists and officials say.
And I&#39;ll also continue to pass the time&amp;nbsp;probie&#45;slapping a certain child who thrives on disinformation.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; When Can I Stop Taking My Daughter Into the Men&#8217;s Room?</title>
<body>There are parts of fatherhood that I love and parts that...well, not so much.&amp;nbsp; One of the latter is having to take the daughter into the public men&#39;s room because (a) there are men there, and (b) it&#39;s often a germophobe&#39;s living hell.&amp;nbsp;
So about when should you be able to stop taking her into the men&#39;s room and what did I consider when mine was very young?
There is no magic number as with a driver&#39;s license &#45; Happy 5th Birthday to the Big Girl Birthday Princess!&amp;nbsp; You can go the women&#39;s restroom now! &#45; and multiple factors come into&amp;nbsp; play.&amp;nbsp; How they intersect is completely up the parent and what one father finds acceptable another might find repugnant.

    Naturally, what&#39;s your assessment of your daughter&#39;s ability to tend to her personal needs?&amp;nbsp; Can she clean herself adequately and do a decent job of washing her hands afterwards?&amp;nbsp; So long as she&#39;s still in any kind of training pants or unable to tend to cleaning/wiping herself, then it&#39;s a non&#45;starter and she&#39;s with you.
    What&#39;s the condition of the men&#39;s restroom?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s been more than one occasion that I&#39;ve walked into the men&#39;s room with her just to take a quick look at the cleanliness.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s likewise been more than one occasion that I&#39;ve left with her to go elsewhere to find an acceptably clean restroom.&amp;nbsp; In those years, we lived in suburban Washington, DC and I could tell&amp;nbsp; you any number of acceptable men&#39;s rooms on Rockville Pike, Georgia Avenue and the vicinity of downtown Silver Spring.&amp;nbsp; I also learned to keep a clean change of clothes packed in the car in case there was a resulting accident.
    If there&#39;s a large women&#39;s restroom, such as in some airports, how many entry/exit points are there to the facility?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been in the position of simultaneously caring for daughter and son in major airports where there were two access points into the women&#39;s room.&amp;nbsp; My fear was that she might exit the other access point while I was preoccupied with the boy.&amp;nbsp; In that instance, I took her into the men&#39;s room even though she could care for her needs.
    What&#39;s her common sense level?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve actually seen a child pick a lollipop off of the toilet stall floor and stick it in his mouth.&amp;nbsp; I suspect that a girl&#39;s marquee won&#39;t be missing so many bulbs, but you have to consider judgment.
    If there are multiple children with which to contend and only one small restroom, I&#39;d consider sending her in the women&#39;s room by herself while I managed the other children outside.
    At no time if your child is in a restroom alone do you leave your place outside the door.

The point and trick in each situation is to assure that the child is either within view or in a place from which there&#39;s no exit without your knowledge.&amp;nbsp; It can be a real test of your multitasking ability if you have more than one child at hand, and there will be moments of real stress as you manage the kids.
And at those moments, I tried to remember to thank God that I didn&#39;t have to change a diaper in an airplane lavatory.</body>

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s Law Of Unintended Consequences</title>
<body>Sometimes when you&#39;re carried away doing something fun with your child, you &#45; or worse yet, your child &#45; is struck by the Law of Unintended Consequences.&amp;nbsp; And I mean that literally.&amp;nbsp; This was vividly and viscerally brought home while watching some poor father with his toddler daughter at the amusement park recently.
We took the kids and some of their friends to a local amusement park for the day.&amp;nbsp; This particular park has a large &amp;quot;Boardwalk&amp;quot; section composed of multiple water rides that range from high and long water slides to a&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Lazy River&amp;quot; ride in which the rider is gently propelled via inner tube along a long, circular concrete river.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s also a large wave tank for older folks and in this particular situation, a smaller wave tank for children.
There were any number of component water toys and fountains as part of this kiddie wave pool and with the brilliant colors, it resembled something brought to life out of Dr. Seuss&#39; imagination.&amp;nbsp; As kids and parents entered the&amp;nbsp;wave area, they passed by and under daisy&#45;yellow pipes that rose out of the ground to a height of seven feet&amp;nbsp;before re&#45;entering the ground several feet away.&amp;nbsp; Suspended from the pipes were large cone&#45;shaped buckets which swung back and forth&amp;nbsp;and into which water streamed from the pipes overhead.&amp;nbsp; When the buckets filled with&amp;nbsp;water, they tipped over and would spill water onto the people who walked underneath on the way to the wave pool.&amp;nbsp; This particular&amp;nbsp;father, who I watched from&amp;nbsp;about thirty yards away, held his little girl in his arms and wanted to get her a little wet before&amp;nbsp;entering the pool.&amp;nbsp; He stood under a bucket as it slowly filled with water and chatted with his little girl awaiting the tip&#45;over.&amp;nbsp; He unfortunately misjudged the amount of water the bucket could hold and when it finally tipped, his baby girl took a large volume directly on her head.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Yes, she cried and I&amp;nbsp;pitied the guy as I watched emotions flash across his face that ranged frrom sheepishness to horror and finally, to disgust.&amp;nbsp; He&amp;nbsp;immediately took the girl&amp;nbsp;away and sat down to console her and apologize profusely.
I felt for the guy because I&#39;ve been there.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Fathers throw their kids, wrestle and swing them and&amp;nbsp;create all manner of mayhem that the kids love.&amp;nbsp; But the downside is that there will be accidents and mishaps and while you want to die, it doesn&#39;t make you a bad father.&amp;nbsp; It does however, make you take a longer and harder look at what can go wrong so&amp;nbsp;that you better appreciate the risksof playing with the kids.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
One of my hardest lessons was dislocating my preschool daughter&#39;s elbow while swinging her like an airplane in the backyard.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;game was to simply hold her hands while swinging her in a circle so that her feet were&amp;nbsp;off of the ground and&amp;nbsp;in this, I was wonderfully successful until&amp;nbsp;she&amp;nbsp;cried out that her elbow hurt.&amp;nbsp; After icing the elbow and still finding her in pain, my wife contacted the pediatrician who saw her within the hour.&amp;nbsp; This doctor labeled it as &amp;quot;nursemaid&#39;s elbow&amp;quot; and was intimately familiar with it since he&#39;d had to reset his&amp;nbsp;own children&#39;s elbows after similar play in his&amp;nbsp;backyard.&amp;nbsp; Unlike this physician however, I never played the game again.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Period.
The guilt of inadvertantly hurting your child is severe.&amp;nbsp; Bur&amp;nbsp;the point&amp;nbsp;is to learn&amp;nbsp;to assess the risks and then adapt so that you either minimize them or avoid them entirely.&amp;nbsp; But don&#39;t let the fear keep you from playing with them because they both&amp;nbsp;love and need it.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<body>When you have kids, expect to have the ends played against the middle and at some point, expect to hear the phrase &amp;quot;But Mom said!&amp;quot;
How do you handle this phrase when it&#39;s tossed on the ground at your feet like a dare to be picked up?&amp;nbsp; In my case, it depends, plain and simple.&amp;nbsp; It depends on whether it&#39;s an area in which I defer to my wife because of better skills.&amp;nbsp; It also depends on whether I expect that she really has a clue as to the reality of the situation.&amp;nbsp; And finally, it simply depends on whether or not I&#39;m torqued at the child, period.
In tonight&#39;s case, one of the kids wanted to ride back around the neighborhood in the failing light of a 9 PM evening.&amp;nbsp; The initial exchange as I returned home was whether or not the child mounting his bike had actually finished doing the dinner dishes.&amp;nbsp; When I had to dig, it became apparent that he hadn&#39;t finished the dishes but instead, only &amp;quot;the dishes&amp;quot;; in his logic, all of the dishes were rinsed and in the dishwasher but none of the pots and pans had been touched.&amp;nbsp; The argument started with the demand to return inside and finish the job and the phrase &amp;quot;But Mom said!&amp;quot; was dropped.&amp;nbsp; But Mom said what?&amp;nbsp; That you could ride because you&#39;d finished your narrowly defined segment of the chores?&amp;nbsp; That you could ride in the failing light and risk a serious accident on the street?&amp;nbsp; In this particular instance, my response was a simple &amp;quot;I don&#39;t care what your mother says, go back inside and finish!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Chagrined and surly, he returned to the house to finish the job.
So how do I typically handle the phrase?

    First, I never simply accept the&amp;nbsp;excuse without further questions.&amp;nbsp; Precisely what did Mom say?&amp;nbsp; What did you ask her permission for?&amp;nbsp; What information did you give her?
    Second, God made cellphones for a reason and my response if things are still unclear is to pick up and call her to verify.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that kids will give incomplete information, whether inadvertant or by design, and it&#39;s helpful to check.
    Third, if it pertains to something about which I clearly disagree &#45; like riding a bike with no headlight at night &#45; I&#39;ll simply refuse.&amp;nbsp; And Mom has come back to me on several occasions to determine why I refused, but she&#39;s always honored my refusal.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, if she has real reservations, then I&#39;ll honor them if they make sense.

In tonight&#39;s case, the bike stayed in the garage as even the teen realized that it was simply too dark to ride after finishing his chores.&amp;nbsp; And boy, am I torqued.</body>

<title>Shopping Smart - Summer Menus</title>
<body>One of the perks of summer is the greater availability of fresh fruits and vegetables, of which I try to take great advantage.&amp;nbsp; The kids love picking the fruit from trees and it&#39;s become an annual highlight; the family record of picked fruit was 2005 when we picked more than 300 pounds of varying fruits and vegetables.&amp;nbsp; But I&#39;ve had to learn to pace myself in purchases so that I don&#39;t waste and have to throw out spoiled food.
We live in a semi&#45;rural area with a large number of farmer&#39;s stands and pick&#45;your&#45;own orchards.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s&amp;nbsp;easy to drop by and become overwhelmed by the variety and amount of fresh food available and on more than one occasion, I&#39;ve engaged in impulse buying that has been a waste of food and money.&amp;nbsp; So what do I try to do when I&#39;m shopping for summer foods?

    Farmer&#39;s stands and orchards are no longer &amp;quot;hey, I&#39;m here so I might as well stop&amp;quot; occasions.&amp;nbsp; They are purposeful stops.
    I have to have a good idea of what&#39;s on the calendar for the next several days, and even weeks, before I make larger purchases.&amp;nbsp; This is especially the case if purchasing larger quantities of fruit which have to be cut up and frozen or preserved before going bad.&amp;nbsp; If we&#39;re going out of town in the height of the peach season &#45; late July/early August &#45; then I simply forego the peach preserves until the next season because I won&#39;t be able to get all of the fruit handled before it spoils.
    Some fruits will simply be ignored because they&#39;re too time intensive when there are children around.&amp;nbsp; Case in point was 2005 when I took my three and three other kids to a local orchard and gave them a half&#45;hour in which to pick fresh Queen Anne cherries.&amp;nbsp; The kids had a blast but I simply didn&#39;t think that they&#39;d manage to pull in 30 pounds of cherries, all of which had to be subsequently pitted before they could be cooked down.&amp;nbsp; That evening, five of us sat at the kitchen table and manually pitted the cherries &#45;&amp;nbsp;a monotonous task only made bearable by great conversation and good beer.
    Not only do I try to know what&#39;s on the calendar for the next several days/weeks, I try to have a reasonable menu that varies from evening to evening.&amp;nbsp; This evening will be grilled eggplant and green pepper along with corn on the cob and chicken.
    Remember to keep cash handy since most, if not all, of these places won&#39;t take check or credit.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Getting your food fresh&amp;nbsp;is not only healthier but also cheaper and can be both fun and educational for the little ones with you.
Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to mix some olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the grilled vegetables.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Why Do Housework?</title>
<body>If there&#39;s anything that I despise more &#45; apart from the New England Patriots &#45; it&#39;s having to do housework.&amp;nbsp; Even with the labor&#45;saving devices, and they really are labor&#45;saving when you consider the old ways, it&#39;s dull work and full of drudgery.&amp;nbsp; The presence of children only makes it more frustrating since everything just gets dirtier that much quicker.&amp;nbsp; So if I hate it so much, why should I actually bother doing housework?
There are actually some compelling reasons.

    The reality is that a dirty house really is a breeding ground for health problems, especially for small children who still haven&#39;t fully developed their immune systems yet.&amp;nbsp; Kids exposed to higher amounts of dust and dirt are likelier to develop difficulty with asthma than kids who reside in a more dust&#45;free house.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, kids are always bringing in new germ variants and will wander through the place leaving colonies like England in the 1600s.&amp;nbsp; These will be picked up by you or the other family members and next thing you know, WHO and CDC are quarantining your place and foreign embassies are issuing travel warnings to your neighborhood.
    It honestly becomes embarrassing to invite people to your home when the carpet is obviously coated with animal hair and the bathrooms haven&#39;t been touched in weeks.&amp;nbsp; This is coming from a guy who isn&#39;t really concerned about appearances.&amp;nbsp; When the kids get older and become aware, they&#39;ll also become embarrassed and unwilling to invite their friends over.
    A relatively neat house &#45; vacuumed, dusted and with most things properly placed/stored &#45; does give a sense of order and stability to the home and by extension, the kids.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s going to be clutter with children and more cihldren generally produces more clutter, but keeping it under control provides a sense that things aren&#39;t out&#45;of&#45;control.
    Kids learn a huge amount by simply watching their parents and if they see that the parents are responsible and able to manage the household, they&#39;ll have a sense of what to do when they&#39;re older.&amp;nbsp; When they are older, you can teach them how to handle some of the chores by themselves and just provide some oversight to assure that things are done properly.&amp;nbsp; Seeing Dad demonstrate some discipline will help set the tone of exercising their own self&#45;discipline when they&#39;re older.

I truly do dislike housework and several thousand loads of laundry have taken the blossom off of the rose, but it&#39;s important that it continue to happen.&amp;nbsp; So tomorrow, I&#39;ll clean my bedroom and bathroom before heading off to take care of other responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; And I&#39;m going to crank up the classic rock when I do.</body>

<title>Letting Kids Drive the Project</title>
<body>Projects take time and that&#39;s especially the case when the kid wants to head the project.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not just that the project will take longer because the kids want to &amp;quot;help&amp;quot;, but also in the sense that the kid may actually want to ramrod the project when he or she becomes older.&amp;nbsp; That means that&amp;nbsp; you&#39;ve got to make a concerted effort to stay with the project and push it ahead lest the kid &#45; usually a teen in this situation &#45; starts to lose interest or heart in the sometimes lengthy project.
Any guy with some experience understands that do&#45;it&#45;yourself projects can be lengthy and occasionally frustrating affairs.&amp;nbsp; Things go wrong or there&#39;s a situation that requires an additional step (or more) that simply wasn&#39;t foreseen and it can be frustrating.&amp;nbsp; But if the teen hasn&#39;t done anything like this before, she&#39;ll have to lean heavily upon you for advice, encouragement and drive.&amp;nbsp; And if you don&#39;t or can&#39;t provide the time that&#39;s necessary to make it happen, then there&#39;s a fair possibility that the project will fail.
Eldest and I have a significant project that&#39;s in danger of failing now and as much as I hate to admit it, a significant part of any responsibility for failure will rest with me.&amp;nbsp; In 2007, we purchased a house &#45; a logistical move, not a &amp;quot;gee, we gotta have this house&amp;quot; move &#45; and the kids noted when we first went through it that there was a DIY fish pond right next to the deck.&amp;nbsp; The kids&#39; response was &amp;quot;Daddy, it&#39;s got a pond!&amp;quot; and my unspoken response was &amp;quot;Oh S*&amp;amp;^, it&#39;s got a pond.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The pond survived decently until last summer (2009) when we encountered a full fish die&#45;off and algae explosion.&amp;nbsp; The liner then proceeded to hole, meaning that the problem was now structural.&amp;nbsp; My thought was that this was the perfect opportunity to fill it in and lay out a small patio with fire pit while Eldest argued forcefully for another pond and with her younger siblings pushing the issue, my wife and I relented.&amp;nbsp; My caveat was that this would be a project that we did ourselves and that Eldest would be responsible for the redesign plans and cost estimates.&amp;nbsp; To her credit, she did these and actually did them well.
The problem was that we started in late July and proceeded to encounter technical problems, like when the dirt side of the pond wall collapsed in a major rain storm.&amp;nbsp; This led to a lengthy side project involving a wire and stone retaining wall that now undergirds the newly replaced liner.&amp;nbsp; The upshot was that the season ended before we could finish with the waterfall segment, which is where we came to understand the previous owner&#39;s Rube Goldberg approach to things.
We&#39;re now in another summer and the pond&#39;s waterfall is as yet unfinished.&amp;nbsp; Eldest has agreed with her mother that it would instead be really cool to have a pondless waterfall and her interest in finishing the other has flagged considerably.&amp;nbsp; My stance now is that we&#39;ll take another crack at the waterfall and if that doesn&#39;t work, then we&#39;ll seriously consider the pondless waterfall option.&amp;nbsp; With the proviso that we again do the project ourselves since I don&#39;t want to spend hard money on something as frivolous as that.
So what do I take from this exercise on the eve of the last crack on the fishpond?

    I was unrealistic to believe that a teen would have the ability to drive through a long&#45;term project without greater support and drive from me.
    I still want to do projects like this on a DIY basis in order for the kids to see that you don&#39;t have to constantly hire people to do things for you (which is why I refuse to pay someone to do my lawn since I have child labor).
    I have to be willing to commit the time to make this happen much more quickly than it did so that it doesn&#39;t lose steam.

So that&#39;s one more additional item on the to&#45;do list, along with the relandscaping of the backyard, another gift of the previous owner.

<title>PracticalDad Discipline:&nbsp; The 25 Cent Solution</title>
<body>One of the purposes of discipline is to teach a child self&#45;control; that good things can come from mastering oneself.&amp;nbsp; Folks who are older &#45; some of us anyway &#45; can grasp the intellectual concept of delayed gratification but that&#39;s difficult for a child who lives in a world of the physical here and now.&amp;nbsp; One way of helping them grasp the concept of self&#45;control is to pay them for good behavior with spending money when the goal is reached.
I was reminded of the technique while talking with the mother of two boys, one of whom is in middle school and the other in upper&#45;elementary.&amp;nbsp; The premise of the 25 cent solution is each child is promised a set amount of money at the end of a defined time period and any violation of the rules is met by a 25 cent reduction in the promised amount.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the mother&#39;s boys, each would receive $5 at the end of the day if they didn&#39;t get called on an infraction.&amp;nbsp; In her case, the infraction pertained to either one smacking the other which is a common complaint for those of us with boys.&amp;nbsp; He looked at me funny so I smacked him!&amp;nbsp; He called me a name so I smacked him!&amp;nbsp; I am not adopted (smack)!&amp;nbsp; You are too (smack)!
It&#39;s a technique that we&#39;ve used on a few occasions as well, but only on longer car trips when the kids are in close proximity that invite border incursions akin to those practiced by the North Korean Army.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s honestly not something that I would use as a disciplinary technique on a daily basis for several reasons.&amp;nbsp;

    First, the kids have to learn that decent behavior is something that is expected of them &#45; and everybody else &#45; if we&#39;re to have a functioning civil society.
    Second, rewards should really be for something exceptional and not commonplace.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, I shaved this morning!&amp;nbsp; I deserve a beer.
    Third, there simply isn&#39;t enough money to meet the growing expectations of aging kids who become more jaded with each passing year.&amp;nbsp; The first grader might be happy with some post cards and a souvenir pencil, but the eighth grader is holding out for an iPod.&amp;nbsp; The last time that I checked, the Federal Reserve was only providing liquidity to large banks and not to parents of kids with champagne tastes.&amp;nbsp;

There are instances however, when it&#39;s a valuable tool.&amp;nbsp; In our case, we&amp;nbsp; used it on long car trips when keeping hands to one&#39;s self really was a feat of self&#45;control.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, the kid knew that the money would be earned and could be spent as he or she deemed fit with no input from us unless it was wholly inappropriate.&amp;nbsp; This meant that we wouldn&#39;t have to listen to constant begging for souvenir money and allowed the kids to allocate their resources as they saw fit.
Here are some guidelines for using the 25 cent solution if you want to consider it.

    Decide in advance what rules are to be followed and explain them clearly.&amp;nbsp; These might include don&#39;t hit (or even touch one another in our car), no bad language, no throwing objects, no teasing/namecallling and whatever else you deem important.
    All judgments are final and non&#45;negotiable.
    If one of the kids is an instigator, the second complaint about the instigator (Dad, I smacked him because he keeps poking me with his foot!) means that the instigator also gets dinged with the 25 cent solution.
    It&#39;s helpful to have a small pad/pen with which to keep a tally each time the child gets dinged for a quarter.
    Specific situations &#45; having to pull the car over &#45; lead to double penalties for all children.
    Expect arguments during the early stages but things will improve as kids and parents learn the intricacies of the solution.

It&#39;s another tool in the disciplinary toolbox and an effective one at that.&amp;nbsp; It can help maintain some order for a period in the family&#39;s life until the kids are old enough to truly control themselves and trips are enjoyable just because, well, they are.</body>

<category>Family Management</category>
<title>PracticalDad Solution:&nbsp; The Details Sheet</title>
<body>Doing things and having fun comes naturally to kids, but other areas like time management and thinking things through don&#39;t come so naturally.&amp;nbsp; This is precisely why I&#39;ve draftedand instituted the Details Sheet.
Kids are generally self&#45;absorbed and egocentric, so not only do they NOT think through their own details, they won&#39;t consider anybody else&#39;s details either.&amp;nbsp; This is what drove me over the edge the other evening as plans were formulated and reformulated with no realization that the lack of drivers&#39; licenses meant that Dad would have to be formally involved.&amp;nbsp; When I required that these&amp;nbsp;carefully &#45; at least what two teens consider carefully &#45; laid plans be re&#45;laid with some foot in reality, the sparks flew.
The basis for time management in the PracticalDad household is the family calendar, which I assiduously maintain during the school year.&amp;nbsp; With the summer schedule, I haven&#39;t been as attentive and have mistakenly thought that they&#39;d be old enough to update some of their own activities.&amp;nbsp; Eldest will circle a date in crayon and list the time for a babysitting gig but there&#39;s no info as to where and for whom and the rest is merely white space.&amp;nbsp; I realized this after the blow&#45;up, which means that I bear some responsibility for the situation and can&#39;t just peg it on a couple of teenagers.
The intent of the Details Sheet is simple and isn&#39;t meant to automatically say no to a kid&#39;s request although there&#39;s going to be some thought that that is indeed the case.&amp;nbsp; The intent is to simply force the kids to examine the details and how their request fits into the greater scheme of the family activities &#45; to make them think beyond themselves so to speak.&amp;nbsp; The questions are journalistically straightforward &#45; what, where, when, with whom, transported how &#45; and are supplemented by the question about what else is on the family calendar.&amp;nbsp; Going forward, any request that I receive will be met with another question as to whether the sheet&#39;s questions have been answered.&amp;nbsp; When all of the questions are answered and everything makes sense, then I&#39;ll probably say yes to the request and make certain that it makes the calendar, preferably following up that they did it.
The reality of any family system is that its effectiveness hinges&amp;nbsp; upon the ability of the parents to uphold and maintain the system.&amp;nbsp; That means several things:

    When the system is rolled out, I can&#39;t appear torqued &#45; even though that&#39;s what prompted the response &#45; or it will be viewed as punitive and resisted;
    I have to consider what questions they&#39;ll pose when they learn of the system and digest it;
    I have to be consistent in referring everything back to the sheet;
    It&#39;s my responsibility to assure that the calendar is still updated even though I want the kids to do it;
    I have to realize that the calendar&#39;s going to be messier as the older kids get used to updating it and will have to stay calm enough to handle things as educational when we discuss correcting the calendar.

The last item will be key.&amp;nbsp; If the intent is to have the kids working in tandem and considering others, then it&#39;s my responsibility to follow through for as long as it takes.&amp;nbsp; And how long is that?&amp;nbsp; As long as necessary until my wife and I are comfortable that they&#39;ve got the basics down and can routinely bring us the necessary information on which to make a decision.</body>

<title>Notes on Bicycle Safety - When Junior&#8217;s Not On the Same Level</title>
<body>Not all kids develop their skills at the same rate and that runs the gamut of activities.&amp;nbsp; Some are poor at hand&#45;eye coordination while those who excel at that are lousy at gross motor skills.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the case with all three of the kids here and notably the case with Youngest&#39;s bicycle skills.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s normally something that doesn&#39;t worry me but when other kids are riding on the neighborhood streets and he&#39;s still uncertain with his balance and skills, then I have to pay particular attention.
Youngest is far and away a big boy, head&#45;and&#45;shoulder above his classmates and is wearing hand&#45;me&#45;down clothing that his older brother wore when he was three years older than Youngest is now.&amp;nbsp; Judging from the commentary of a physical therapist friend &#45; who specializes in balance issues &#45; that growth has impacted the balance skills which simply haven&#39;t caught up and compensated for the larger body.&amp;nbsp; I haven&#39;t pressed the issue and have let him set the pace for the past two&amp;nbsp;years; we&#39;d go to the local playground and ride around while he slowly learned his skills and it&#39;s been in the last three weeks that he&#39;s finally mastered the skills.
The issue that arose last week was his wish to ride back to his friend&#39;s house and then ride with the friend and family to a neighborhood playground.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve done no practical road skills with him apart from talking about road rules and that doesn&#39;t qualify as prepared.&amp;nbsp; He desperately wanted to go, especially since this child will sometimes taunt if someone&#39;s skills don&#39;t measure his, but I refused and dropped him off at the friend&#39;s house with his Razor Scooter.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s not so far&#45;fetched I figured, since there are any number of neighborhood teens who ride their Razors and do stunts with them.&amp;nbsp; It worked on that occasion but the occasion will arise again and he needs to be prepared.&amp;nbsp; The other aspect is that road safety and skills are my responsibility and not that of some other parent; taking a child on the road involves issues of legal liability and that&#39;s my problem.
So tonight began the road rules practicum.&amp;nbsp; We started with the rules discussion before we even left the driveway:&amp;nbsp;

    Ride on the right side with the traffic;
    Stop at every stop sign and look both ways AND behind;
    Wear a helmet at all times;
    Know the hand signs for right, left and stop;
    Know the surrounding traffic and don&#39;t think that they know you;
    Ride single file but stay in front of me where I can see you.

After discussing the rules, we talked about the route and what we&#39;d do, then we left.&amp;nbsp;
On one level, this shouldn&#39;t be about &amp;quot;keeping up with the developmentally advanced Joneses&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Over the next week, we&#39;ll take progressively longer road trips and will continue until I&#39;m comfortable that he&#39;s mastered the road skills.&amp;nbsp; But on the other hand, when he&#39;s got the balance and riding issues down pat, then it&#39;s my responsibility to help take him over the final hump and that might mean that I have to take extra time to assure that it&#39;s done properly.&amp;nbsp; When I&#39;m comfortable that he&#39;s there, then I&#39;ll turn him loose with the friend and family.&amp;nbsp; And if he&#39;s still not there, I can at least honestly say that he needs some additional work but has the basics down pat.
I won&#39;t push the skills faster than they seem to be capable of going, but once they&#39;re there, I have to be ready to make the time to finish the job.</body>

<title>What&#8217;s a Real Dad Look Like?</title>
<body>Throughout my wife&#39;s first pregnancy and the first several months of Eldest&#39;s life, I had difficulty believing that I was a father.&amp;nbsp; The guy in the mirror was the same one that I&#39;d known throughout my life and it didn&#39;t register that now I was going to be someone akin to my own father and all of his peers.&amp;nbsp; What precisely should a father look like?&amp;nbsp; Certainly not the guy who several years before was partying in a club.&amp;nbsp; The idea of fatherhood has settled with time and I now suspect that I appear to my own kids as my dad appeared to me.&amp;nbsp; But the big secret is that there is no father &amp;quot;look&amp;quot; that makes one stand out as an identifiable dad.
If you want to examine this, spend time watching the men who are with their kids at events.&amp;nbsp; The event to which I&#39;m referring now was the weekend cub scout resident camp attended by about 150 boys and their accompanying parents &#45; a few moms but mostly dads.&amp;nbsp; What do I notice about the guys?

    Most fathers favor beaten and semi&#45;ratty baseball caps, the bills comfortably bent and the headband stained with sweat.
    The large majority of us have short haircuts that are easy to clean and maintain and a fairly sizeable minority is bald.
    Many of the fathers are at least in their mid&#45;thirties and some of us are significantly older than that.&amp;nbsp; There are very few fathers who are discernibly less than thirty years of age.
    Many of the fathers carry a corresponding paunch varying from mild love handles to beer kegs.&amp;nbsp; The arms might be thick and muscular but the midsection is as well.
    Many of the fathers thrived on the morning cup of coffee and are capable of making it last until the early afternoon.
    Many of the fathers looked at their sons with a varying mix of love, exasperation and wonderment, realizing that they too were once as spastic and wild as their boys.
    This father at least wished that there could be a similar event to share with the daughter, but is aware that Girl Scout guidelines forbid close distances between men and girls at campsites and that the sense is that men are discouraged from attending due to liability guidelines.
    All of the fathers were walking billboards,&amp;nbsp;carrying ads&amp;nbsp;and insignia on the caps and&amp;nbsp;shirts.&amp;nbsp; These range from favorite fishing and boating businesses to NASCAR&amp;nbsp;sponsors and even the Israeli Defense Force.
    Many of the fathers understood the&amp;nbsp;concept of pacing oneself&amp;nbsp;as the boys run ahead, saving themselves for when they have to carry the boys&amp;nbsp;before Taps sounds in the&amp;nbsp;mid&#45;evening.&amp;nbsp; The kids can&amp;nbsp;run, but the&amp;nbsp;Dads will find a spot&amp;nbsp;to sit whenever possible.&amp;nbsp;
    Despite the regulations about all medications being handled at the camp first&#45;aid cabin, more than a few of us kept a small bottle of Advil in our kit.
    Many of the fathers kept a running dialogue with their sons about the location of towels, trunks and toothbrushes.
    More than one father was heard to say of course there are flies out here, you&#39;re camping.&amp;nbsp; What do you expect?
    Many fathers looked uncomfortable singing at the first night&#39;s campfire but by the third night, were shouting at the top of their lungs during the songs.
    While some mothers were concerned with the boys&#39; appearance &#45; and I have heard more than one talk through the years about staying clean and neat &#45; the fathers&#39; attitude was indifference.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re camping, what do you expect?

There is no look to fatherhood and there is no image.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re all different but strikingly similar in the desire to see our kids grow well into productive adults who can handle whatever comes along.&amp;nbsp; And if that means that we&#39;re dirty, sweaty and unkempt, so be it.
We&#39;re camping.&amp;nbsp; What do you expect?</body>

<title>Can I Take the Remote Away?</title>
<body>It&#39;s natural that kids are going to press limits and defy parents.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re growing and testing limits and the results when the limits are enforced aren&#39;t always pretty.&amp;nbsp; But what do you do with a kid who ignores you in the moment and proceeds with whatever it is that they want?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the situation that I learned about this morning when a father banned television for his middle&#45;school son and the boy then took the remote and sat down and flipped on the set.&amp;nbsp; What are the options available?
Let me start by saying that I&#39;m a firm believer in parental/paternal authority, what some now consider to be a quaint notion.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m legally responsible for their safety and behavior&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;I believe that they simply don&#39;t have the experience and judgment to&amp;nbsp;handle whatever&amp;nbsp;comes their way.&amp;nbsp; So if&amp;nbsp;I expect them to listen when those crunch times&amp;nbsp;arise, I need to be&amp;nbsp;able to depend on them to listen &#45; and obey &#45; when the stakes aren&#39;t so high.&amp;nbsp; That means that they don&#39;t have the option of picking and choosing when to listen; they can question me if they want and&amp;nbsp;we can discuss it,&amp;nbsp;and there have been moments when&amp;nbsp;I&#39;ll even change my mind if&amp;nbsp;the objection both makes sense and is properly presented.&amp;nbsp; But the child&amp;nbsp;&#45; and that includes teen &#45; is expected to toe the line when required.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s where it gets dicey.
So if&amp;nbsp;Junior takes the remote and clicks on the television despite the ban, what are the options?

    Do nothing and leave the room,&amp;nbsp;or do nothing and continue to talk/lecture/argue with the boy.&amp;nbsp; The reality is that the advantage now lays with the boy.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s ensconced on the sofa and watching television while&amp;nbsp;Dad&#39;s the one who is standing there talking.&amamp;nbsp; The thought probably running through&amp;nbsp;his head is that if he continues on the same path, then Dad will tire and&amp;nbsp;eventually leave and he can continue on with the show.&amp;nbsp; The&amp;nbsp;obvious problem with this approach is that&amp;nbsp;the kid&#39;s learned that he&#39;ll win and the situations will continue and worsen through the years until the situation is untenable.
    Physically go after the remote and remove it&amp;nbsp;from the boy&#39;s hands.&amp;nbsp; Adolescent boys are particularly difficult with&amp;nbsp;testosterone and growing masculinity and the risk is that there&#39;s going to be a full&#45;blown brawl.&amp;nbsp; Worse than that, if the kid is hurt then you have to consider the prospect of being charged with abuse.&amp;nbsp; If that doesn&#39;t happen, you&#39;re still faced with the roiled emotions and damaged pride that can created further damage.
    Know what the boy truly values and then use leverage&amp;nbsp;to regain the remote.&amp;nbsp; If the kid has a cellphone, use that to regain the remote.&amp;nbsp; Threaten to take the cellphone and if he physically has it, then promise to call the carrier and cancel the contract.&amp;nbsp; The key is that if you&#39;re going to use leverage, you&amp;nbsp;have to&amp;nbsp;follow through with whatever&#39;s&amp;nbsp;promised.&amp;nbsp; It helps&amp;nbsp;then to have a history of following through with what&#39;s promised&amp;nbsp;and that&#39;s something that comes from paying attention and following through from the youngest ages.&amp;nbsp; You can still do it if it&#39;s new to the boy, but the situation will still be a mess.&amp;nbsp; Full disclosure:&amp;nbsp; I have a track record of following through on unpleasant consequences and have used leverage successfully on&amp;nbsp;a number of occasions with all three of the kids.

That&#39;s the reality that you often won&#39;t see on the parenting shows, a reality of tension and unpleasantness that simply has to be waded through.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s liable to be yelling and while I don&#39;t spend my time bellowing, there are actually moments when it serves a purpose.&amp;nbsp; But the important thing is to make sure that Junior toes the line because if he doesn&#39;t, then the unpleasantries will spill outside the house into other, more public, venues.</body>

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s Language:&nbsp; I Can&#8217;t Believe That I Said That</title>
<body>I saw&amp;nbsp;Scott at an auction recently, also a father with three young adult children, and I unfortunately put my foot in my mouth &#45; a not uncommon occurrence for me.&amp;nbsp; He was relating that they were gathering furniture in the garage for their youngest&#39;s move to a new apartment with his college friend and his wife commented that they&#39;d have to probably &amp;quot;move that s*** for him as well.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; When he asked if I could believe that she would say that something like, my response was that I really could believe that.
He was visibly annoyed, especially since his wife is a quiet and capable woman&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp;never uses profanity.&amp;nbsp;
Kids will act &#45;or not act &#45; in a way that&#39;s guaranteed to irritate you and one of the ways that this will show is your language.&amp;nbsp; My late father was a former Korean War&#45;era army drill instructor and I grew up in a household that wasn&#39;t obscene but certainly profane at times.&amp;nbsp; If I had to characterize him as a television father, he was closest&amp;nbsp;to Red Forman of&amp;nbsp;That 70s&amp;nbsp;Show.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;He was capable of stringing together expletives and&amp;nbsp;phrases that alternated between colorful, vulgar, scatological and physically impossible &#45; which made them especially hilarious to a boy in his middle&#45;teens.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s carried over to my own household although I do try to monitor what comes out of my mouth and can honestly say that much of what I heard as a kid and teen has never made it to my own kids.&amp;nbsp; Tell my kids that however, and they simply won&#39;t believe it.
The upshot is that I can&#39;t just haul off and yell when they in turn use a poor choice of words.&amp;nbsp; I can say that I&#39;m an adult and they&#39;re not, but that will only carry over to behavior within the presence of adults and&amp;nbsp; not to language used around their peers.&amp;nbsp; I have to set an example and try to actively monitor what I say.&amp;nbsp; There are certain guidelines that I&#39;ve adopted over the years and to which I try to adhere.

    Don&#39;t use expletives or racial/gender epitaphs&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;describe&amp;nbsp;other people.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll use terms such as cretin, moron, idiot or the family favorite, bonehead.&amp;nbsp; As they&#39;ve grown, we&#39;ve had conversations about judging people based upon their behavior instead of their gender and race &#45; even religion &#45; and I&#39;m adamant that you have to make value judgments but they have to be based on the actions of a person.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not an easy conversation with a young child but it&#39;s easier after they hit elementary school.
    Certain words have simply vanished from my vocabulary, including the F&#45;bomb.
    Don&#39;t chastise a child who&#39;s used an expletive immediately after a physical injury.&amp;nbsp; When Youngest took a baseball in the mouth and bled from a gashed lip, I let the immediate expletive sonuvabitch pass.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll worry about the lip and blood first and if the language continues, then we&#39;ll deal with it.&amp;nbsp; Besides, when he beaned me in the kidney with a pitch last week, I said the exact same thing.&amp;nbsp; Like son, like father.
    Never use a derogatory term to refer to your child, even when they&#39;ve done something that qualifies as certifiably stupid.&amp;nbsp; I grew up with dumbass and never liked the term.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s better to condemn the behavior and I&#39;ll try to say something akin to you&#39;re smarter than that, so why&#39;d you do something so idiotic/stupid/dumb?&amp;nbsp; Full disclosure:&amp;nbsp; Even I&#39;ve been appalled enough in the moment to&amp;nbsp;refer to more than one child as idiots.&amp;nbsp; But I try hard to avoid those instances and have apologized in the follow&#45;up conversation.&amp;nbsp; Except once and I&#39;ll never apologize for that one since they were old enough to know better.
    There is such a thing as guy talk and I&#39;ve used it in small amounts around the elder son after he reached middle school.&amp;nbsp; I adhere to the rules as listed above and am clear with the boy that this conversation is strictly between father and son and has no place amongst the remainder of the family or outside.&amp;nbsp; And when I&#39;ve heard him violate those rules &#45; and you&#39;ll know when you hear it &#45; then the result has been that the guy talk has gone away for a period of time.
    The flip side of guy talk is that I refuse to comment on another woman&#39;s appearance.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s the one with addled testosterone and I expect to hear some comments about being hot, but I refuse to comment.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, it would be wildly inappropriate and borderline perverse to comment on a child his age and I don&#39;t want him thinking that I&#39;m looking at anyone other than his mother.&amp;nbsp; Kids need stability and the thought that Dad is looking outside the house is destabilizing.

The language is an ongoing work in progress and I really am much better than I was as a young adult, not that they&#39;ll believe it.&amp;nbsp; And now I have to figure out what I&#39;ll say to Scott when I next see him.</body>

<title>PracticalDad Solutions:&nbsp; Uniform Hooks</title>
<body>If&amp;nbsp; you spend any time talking with other fathers, you can expect to hear the same concerns and irritations about the kids.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re disorganized, late, unmindful of the time.&amp;nbsp; The difficulty is that most of us forget what it&#39;s like to have been kids but if you think about it, you&#39;ll find that you probably weren&#39;t that much different in those regards.&amp;nbsp; And if you think about it further, you&#39;ll sometimes run across ways to help your kid so that the irritating moments are fewer.&amp;nbsp; It was the situation that another father &#45; who I&#39;ll call Bill &#45; considered and came across a simple answer for his son&#39;s situation.
Bill is the father of Jacob, a rising second grader playing for a little league team that&#39;s composed of many older boys.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s on the lowest cusp of the age grouping for that level but his level of play is such that he&#39;d be wasting his time at the lower level of coach&#45;pitch baseball.&amp;nbsp; When those situations occur, you expect that the younger player will struggle a bit as he (or she) plays up to the level of boys who might be three years older.&amp;nbsp; But&amp;nbsp;Jacob is truly a gifted, gritty little guy whose play typically matched that of even the oldest boys.&amp;nbsp; When I first saw Jacob at practice, I was surprised by&amp;nbsp;his skill level both with the glove as well as the bat.&amp;nbsp; As the boys were messing around at the end&#45;of&#45;season team picnic, Bill and I chatted and the topic turned to the pre&#45;game household rituals, especially in regards to trying to get out of the door on time.&amp;nbsp; Bill&#39;s expectations were simple and he understood that laundry meant that the clothing was sometimes out of the boy&#39;s control, but he did expect that the boy would know where his hat was.&amp;nbsp; It seems a little thing,&amp;nbsp; but many young boys frequently can&#39;t find their own heads.&amp;nbsp; After several instances of not knowing the hat&#39;s location &#45; and it is a nice hat with a stitched league logo, by the way &#45; Bill settled on the uniform hook.
The uniform hook is a standard metal coat hook that can be mounted on a wall.&amp;nbsp; There are two protruding hooks attached to the same base, the upper hook being larger and extending farther than the smaller lower hook.&amp;nbsp; Bill mounted one of these hooks in the bedroom with simple instructions:&amp;nbsp; your uniform and hat stay on the hook.&amp;nbsp; We won&#39;t fold the clean uniform and put it in the drawer with the other clothes, we&#39;ll just hang it on the hook.&amp;nbsp; And you will keep your hat on the hook, ready for when you have to go play ball.&amp;nbsp; Yeah, there&#39;s now a hook with clothing mounted on the wall but I think that that&#39;s acceptable given all of the other nonsense that&#39;s in a boy&#39;s room.
It&#39;s a simple and effective solution that keeps things easy for the kids and the parents.&amp;nbsp; Dad doesn&#39;t have to go upstairs to find the game shirt that&#39;s in the drawer where it belongs.&amp;nbsp; Junior knows that he&#39;s got a special spot for something that he probably prizes and that even serves as a visual reminder of something that he loves.&amp;nbsp; And the only words that usually have to be spoken are a reminder upon return from the game to put the hat on the hook.
Kids want to please their parents if given the chance and they especially want to show how they&#39;re progressing as they grow.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes it only takes a little thought to come up with a workable plan to minimize the angst and help the child show what he can do.</body>

<title>The End of School Scheduling</title>
<body>Any shift from one aspect to another is typically bumpy and that&#39;s no different from going from the school year to summer vacation.&amp;nbsp; The change is noted by a flurry of activity as kids have end&#45;of&#45;school family nights/parties, tournaments, playoffs/championships and recitals.&amp;nbsp; In this household, we&#39;ve survived the tournaments and playoffs &#45; and championship win &#45; and are awaiting the final recital and the corollary practices.&amp;nbsp; It creates greater stress as the practices and events sometimes overlap and it&#39;s difficult to manage the usual household activities as well.
There are certain things that I stay on top of during these stretches, even as I&#39;ve learned that some of the daily stuff has to wait.

    Where&#39;s the equipment?&amp;nbsp; Kids will tend to shed equipment entering the house as a snake sheds its skin.&amp;nbsp; Unchecked, the cleats will be left in one location and the socks can be found under the family room sofa while the shin guards have been tossed across the room and landed behind the television set.&amp;nbsp; Make certain that the child properly disposes of equipment upon entering the house so that when called upon for the next use before the upcoming game, it can be easily found and the frantic agitation avoided.
    Assure that the uniforms and outfits are cleaned in time for the next game.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s tempting to think that the shirt doesn&#39;t look dirty or might not smell, but the reality is that the kids do get dirty and you&#39;re setting an example by how you handle it.&amp;nbsp; Besides, would you really want to wear a jockstrap that&#39;s been through a seven inning or sixty minute game?
    The water bottles are cleaned and ready to go.&amp;nbsp; One of us will also frequently toss one or more bottles in the fridge the morning of a game so that the water&#39;s relatively cold at gametime.&amp;nbsp; If the weather&#39;s hot, we&#39;ll even throw a water bottle in the freezer for several hours so that the ice will melt in the heat and keep the water cold.&amp;nbsp;
    Is there any responsibility for snacks?&amp;nbsp; Some smaller kids teams will have post&#45;game treats and parents take responsibility for individual weeks.&amp;nbsp; Even as the kids age, some parents will provide half&#45;time snacks &#45; oranges and grapes &#45; for a quick energy boost at the half.&amp;nbsp; So what are you responsible for and what has to be done to make it happen?
    At the end of the season, is anybody taking responsibility for getting the coach(es) a thank you gift or card?&amp;nbsp; In most instances, these activities happen because different parents are stepping up and volunteering their time and some gesture is only reasonable and appropriate.&amp;nbsp; In the case of the baseball coaches &#45; all of whom are fathers &#45; each received a gift card and the head coach got a ball signed by all of the players.&amp;nbsp; The soccer coaches &#45; both mothers &#45; likewise got gift cards accompanied by a card signed by the team.
    Even if family meals themselves are blown out of the water, the kids still have to eat decently.&amp;nbsp; Are they getting the proteins, fruits and vegetables that their bodies require?&amp;nbsp; In our case, we&#39;ve learned to stock up on eggs since they&#39;re easy to fix and are a great source of protein prior to&amp;nbsp;a game.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, is the food prepared in time for them before departure?&amp;nbsp; Eating a meal and then immediately running 70 minutes in a soccer game is a recipe for disaster, so quick and decent meals are prepared for eating about 90 minutes before the event &#45; if possible.

Much of the daily stuff will wait until the evening or weekend for completion.&amp;nbsp; And then when everything&#39;s done, I&#39;ll take a deep breath and get ready for the summer break.</body>

<title>Clothing Teen-age Boys</title>
<body>Shopping for kids clothing gets a little dicier when the kids reach the teen years.&amp;nbsp; The occasionally wild swings in the growth rate makes purchases a hit/miss proposition and my response is to keep things simple.&amp;nbsp; The everyday wear is cheap enough at Kmart that I&#39;ll hit there for jeans and shirts, supplemented by hand&#45;me&#45;downs from friends with boys older than my own.&amp;nbsp; But one of the things for which I&#39;m responsible is teaching the boys how to dress appropriately and that means that they have some basic and decent items for events such as church, school concerts and more formal occasions.&amp;nbsp; That also means that I have to show them how to pay attention to the details so that they don&#39;t come off looking like Jethro Bodeen.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, I don&#39;t believe that any quality dresswear is available at Kmart.&amp;nbsp; So how do I match decent clothing that&#39;s also inexpensive for a boy who&#39;s going to last in it for a maximum of 6 months, if that?
After our end&#45;of&#45;school lunch with Mom and the kids, we split up in the mall; my wife and Eldest went to look at bathing suits while the boys and I browsed in a music store.&amp;nbsp; After we finished, we went to the department store bathing suit area to pick up the ladies.&amp;nbsp; Middle, who&#39;s now 13, and I wandered to the Men&#39;s Department and after eyeballing him, asked him to try on a plain men&#39;s blazer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My appraising&amp;nbsp;eye is still decent and he went into a 36 jacket, although the sleeves were too short so I moved him up to a 36 Regular.&amp;nbsp; As he tried on the blazers, I asked him to do certain things to ascertain if it fit properly and I also made it a point to explain why he was doing these things.&amp;nbsp;

    Lift your arms in front of you like Frankenstein.&amp;nbsp; How far up along the wrist do the sleeves ride?&amp;nbsp; Let you arms hang naturally at your side.&amp;nbsp; Does the sleeve come about halfway between the bottom thumb joint and the wrist?
    Button the top button of the jacket &#45; you typically don&#39;t button both &#45; and look in the mirror.&amp;nbsp; Does the material lay naturally around your midsection or does it appear to be tight?
    Turn around and keep the jacket buttoned.&amp;nbsp; Does it appear to be tight and stretch (&amp;quot;span&amp;quot;) across the back?
    How far down along the torso does the jacket hang?&amp;nbsp; Teens are notable for some call the colt stage since they can grow disproportionately.&amp;nbsp; In Middle&#39;s case, he&#39;s got a long torso and disproportionately long arms that grew ahead of the rest of his body.

&amp;nbsp;How do I reconcile my belief that he, like all teens, needs to have some truly decent clothing and the recognition that this blazer was on sale for $90 and he&#39;ll be out of it in months?
The plan is to make one or more visits to Goodwill in the next week.&amp;nbsp; In my experience &#45; and some of my own clothing comes from there &#45; the dress clothing tends to be gently used and in decent condition.&amp;nbsp; The men&#39;s clothing typically comes from guys who have outgrown it themselves but has been cared for in its previous use.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll drop by several times and search for a 36 Regular jacket that has held up well and pick it up for about $7.50.&amp;nbsp; If I can keep on top of Middle so that the jacket continues to be in decent shape, it might go to Youngest when he&#39;s older.
That assumes that their the same torso/arm proportions.&amp;nbsp; If they aren&#39;t, then it&#39;s back to Goodwill again.
When the guys have finished growing, then we&#39;ll take them out for some new, high quality menswear.

<title>College Debt:&nbsp; The UK And a Look Ahead</title>
<body>The toxic college debt meme is spreading and if you want a glimpse of what&#39;s liable to happen here, consider the situation in the UK.&amp;nbsp; As you may be aware, the UK is one of multiple European countries that are looking at grim economic times in the next several decades and the new coalition government is taking steps to lay out new austerity measures.&amp;nbsp; While the figures are still nebulous, the prospect is that the size of the UK national debt will require up to 20% cuts in many programs, if not all of them.&amp;nbsp; And financing of higher education is one of the programs on the table.
A few words about the UK university system.&amp;nbsp; The universities there are largely under the purview of a Universities Minister within the government, who in this case is David Willetts.&amp;nbsp; Like the US, many of the students will borrow to finance their education and the average English University graduate will leave with a debt owed of about 22,000 Pounds (almost $32,000 at an exchange rate of $1.45).&amp;nbsp; Much of the money comes from public funding and unlike the US, repayment isn&#39;t required until the graduate is employed and has an annual&amp;nbsp;income of at least 15,000 Pounds (almost $22,000 at the same exchange rate).&amp;nbsp; With job prospects amongst young people much poorer than their older countrymen, that means that a significant amount of debt is simply being carried without repayment until the student is several years older and no cash flow back to a starving national treasury.
The upshot is a series of moves &#45; and corresponding comments &#45; from the UK Universities Minister that are best likened to a bushwhacking of unaware students unprepared for the real world about to be unleashed on them.&amp;nbsp; The first and obvious move is discussion of a rise in annual university fees.&amp;nbsp; Yes, being essentially part of European society, there is an English National Union of Students which opposes the increase; and being English and students, they&#39;ll probably find their voice in a series of riots.&amp;nbsp;
The other aspect&amp;nbsp;is a&amp;nbsp;structural changes that are really more daunting.&amp;nbsp; First is the suggestion that English teenagers place a greater emphasis upon entry into an apprenticeship program with practical training.&amp;nbsp; If they continue and do well, then an actual degree could be considered.&amp;nbsp; The article provides the example of entry into an apprentice position with British Telecom followed later by a possible degree in Electrical Engineering.&amp;nbsp; The problem with that is the question of just how many hands&#45;on positions there are in the English economy to support the masses of young people who would want such a position.&amp;nbsp; What exactly does England do and make anymore?
Comments made by Willetts indicate&amp;nbsp;another major institutional change.&amp;nbsp; As Willetts first&amp;nbsp;stated, public funding of student higher education is a &amp;quot;burden on the taxpayer that had to be tackled.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; The common view for years has been that the public should help pay for a youngster&#39;s education, akin to it takes a village to raise a child on a larger scale.&amp;nbsp; But in the new austerity, the government and culture will shift its view to one that again places the bulk of the educational onus back onto the family.&amp;nbsp; This paradigm shift back to the individual is reinforced by Willetts&#39; other comment that &amp;quot;the so&#45;called debt (students) have is more like an obligation to pay a higher income tax.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; So we&#39;ll no longer call it debt but instead consider it as something to be paid for the added benefit of an education.&amp;nbsp; Regardless of whether or not that value&#45;added education actually leads to higher income.&amp;nbsp; The response of the young president&#45;elect&amp;nbsp;of the National Union of Students, Aaron Porter, was that it &amp;quot;very much felt like debt to them.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;
The situation is a microcosm of the coming debates on the role of higher education and how to pay for it.&amp;nbsp; The comments section contained a succinct summation of the position in which English teens and young adults find themselves.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Kibblesworth&amp;quot; writes:
And it&#39;s all very well urging everyone to go into apprenticeship now &#45; but the fact is that schools, for the last 13 years, have pretty much based their goals on getting their students to pass exams to get into uni.&amp;nbsp; No real skills are taught...We were constantly told that uni was the only way we were ever going to get a decent job.&amp;nbsp; Many of us have applied &#45; and many more have taken out student loans already.
The reality is that this view has been promulgated for more than 13 years, but it&#39;s been about that long to the young Kibblesworth.&amp;nbsp;
Our job is to prepare our children for their adulthood and our real influence should last greater than the years that we are their legal guardians.&amp;nbsp; Times are changing and we have an obligation to both understand the present circumstances and speak frankly and honestly to them about what they should expect and how to enter their adult world prepared to survive and prosper.</body>

<title>What Do I Really Have To Teach Them?&nbsp; (Part 3)</title>
<body>As the kids age, they have a full range of new experiences and they sometimes aren&#39;t as prepared as they think that they might be.&amp;nbsp; You move beyond the shoe&#45;tying and get into other life experiences.&amp;nbsp; What are some of the more recent things that I &#45; and my wife &#45; have to teach the kids?

    Using a power jig saw for cutting plywood.
    Pulling a minivan into a space between two vehicles.
    Catching behind home plate before the first pitching in the next game.
    Reading a contract in its entirety.
    Driving a nail straight while building a bird house.
    Plunging a clogged toilet.
    Removing the spark plug cover before turning over the lawn mower.
    Fixing bent bike handlebars and a broken caliper brake.
    Putting air in bike tires and adjusting a bike seat.
    Changing the sheets on a bed.
    Cleaning a bathroom and scrubbing a toilet.
    Practicing for a four minute school presentation the next day.
    Monitoring deadlines for school activities and projects.
    Estimating costs and laying out the steps for a summer&amp;nbsp;fishpond project.
    Countersinking screws for a kayak project.
    Discussing plans and activities for managing a group of&amp;nbsp;younger children.
    Apologizing for careless or thoughtless remarks.

The point is that&amp;nbsp;kids aren&#39;t going to automatically figure things out by themselves and you can&#39;t assume that they just &amp;quot;get it.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Not to mention that power tools can be coldly unforgiving.</body>

<title>Apologizing to the Kids</title>
<body>There are&amp;nbsp;moments when I overreact and last night contained one of those moments.&amp;nbsp; I made a comment in addressing a situation at dinner and shortly afterwards, the family dispersed as my wife and I took the kids to multiple activities.&amp;nbsp; While I was gone, the comment nagged at me until I concluded that I had no choice but to apologize to the child in question.&amp;nbsp; Before that child&#39;s bedtime, I apologized for the comment; as we talked, I specifically stated that I didn&#39;t apologize for the other outcome of that mess, but did want to say that I was sorry for the words.
On NCIS, Jethro Gibbs has a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;rule that forbids making an apology because it makes that person apologizing appear weak.&amp;nbsp; And there&#39;s some merit to that since it&#39;s common to hear people utter the word sorry &#45;&amp;nbsp;especially children &#45; &amp;nbsp;in a flip and unconvincing manner.&amp;nbsp; And many parents are leery of apologizing to their children because they fear that it calls their authority and image into question.&amp;nbsp; If I apologize for this, then they&#39;ll question me or throw it back in my face later.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not that much of a concern for the littler ones but it can be legitimate for the &#39;tweens and teens.
But I concluded some time ago that it&#39;s better to apologize than stay close&#45;mouthed when wrong.

    I realized&amp;nbsp;soon after becoming a father that a child has to be taught almost everything.&amp;nbsp; That runs the gamut from holding a spoon to tying shoes but also an intangible skill such as issuing a meaningful and appropriate apology.&amp;nbsp;
    If a child with hurt feelings can hear an apology for what created those feelings, they&#39;re more likely when older to consider their own comments and the effect upon others.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re more likely to realize when they&#39;ve said something stupid and recall how it felt.
    Apologizing&amp;nbsp;for something legitimate forces me to carefully work through the situation&amp;nbsp;again with the child.&amp;nbsp; I can again review a situation with the child and&amp;nbsp;yet some of the&amp;nbsp;burden of being reminded is removed from the child.&amp;nbsp; In last night&#39;s case, I&amp;nbsp;took&amp;nbsp;responsibility for uttering a cruel and stupid remark.&amp;nbsp; And&amp;nbsp;in the same conversation,&amp;nbsp;I was also able to explain to my child why&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;preceding action&amp;nbsp;was also wrong and worthy&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;discipline even if&amp;nbsp;the comment was unnecessary.&amp;nbsp;
    It simply keeps the lines of communication open.&amp;nbsp; Wrongly used words can be corrosive and if there&#39;s no recognition that they&#39;re said, then there&#39;s damage to a relationship that&#39;s going to be tested as the kids age.

In their own eyes, kids have a lot more to prove than their parents.&amp;nbsp; Many want to show that they&#39;re able to do for themselves and it&#39;s natural that they fear an apology will make them appear incapable and weak.&amp;nbsp; So I&#39;m going to have to continue to be willing to apologize when I&#39;m legitimately wrong.&amp;nbsp; There will be a time when they&#39;ll also step up &#45; in fact, there have already been several occasions when that&#39;s occurred.
And I also need to work on my own mouth.</body>

<title>Fatherhood and Discipline:&nbsp; It&#8217;s Not Like Television</title>
<body>I enjoy watching shows like &amp;quot;Supernanny&amp;quot; but find myself conflicted while watching it.&amp;nbsp; On the one hand, it does a good job of introducing important tools and points that bring the particular family from train wreck to functional.&amp;nbsp; But even assuming that everybody&#39;s not on absolute best behavior for the camera, the one hour limit doesn&#39;t show the maddening, frustrating efforts at getting to that desired point.
Being an involved father &#45; or mother for that matter &#45; isn&#39;t always easy.&amp;nbsp; The end of the show displays an engaged family playing in the yard and smiling happily.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that while those moments certainly exist, there are plenty of other moments where you&#39;re trying to ride herd on and teach kids that sometimes aren&#39;t going to cooperate.&amp;nbsp; The non&#45;cooperation can be limited to one child but if there are more kids involved, it&#39;s likely to spread as kids start to veer off the track for various reasons.&amp;nbsp; They might find it fun to drive Dad over the edge or they start to misbehave to gain attention like the repreobate sibling.&amp;nbsp; Or they join in solidarity of teen rebellion.
Let me give you an example.&amp;nbsp; Time&#45;outs are a good disciplinary tool when the kids are younger and a TV show will demonstrate it being done by a parent in a several minute segment.&amp;nbsp; You might see the Dad returning the kid to the spot when&amp;nbsp;he tires of it, but that only takes a few times before the kid knuckles under &#45; and that&#39;s exactly what it is &#45; and remains there.&amp;nbsp; And again, at the end of the show, things are infinitely improved.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that the process by which a child learns that you&#39;re serious can take far longer.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had early time&#45;outs take longer than an hour as the child repeatedly gets up to leave without permission and the mutual frustration level is high.&amp;nbsp; But you can&#39;t quit because that only teaches the child that further disobedience is permissible.&amp;nbsp; So don&#39;t be surprised if you find that your voice and blood pressure are raised and an out&#45;of&#45;body view shows you to appear to be on your last shred of patience.
So what are your options?

    Tag&#45;team the situation with your mate so that you can get a short breather before re&#45;entering and taking your turn.
    Enforce the discipline with further measures.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve enforced time&#45;outs with a recalcitrant child by using a three&#45;count with loss of favored toys/privileges for refusal to cooperate.
    Then be sure to enforce that measure.
    Send the child to bed for the night.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll scream and carry on but will eventually wear out and you&#39;ll get some quiet.&amp;nbsp; If that means it&#39;s as early as 5 PM, so be it.&amp;nbsp; There are times when the child is legitimately at the end of his tether due to exhaustion and simply cannot control himself.
    If you&#39;re alone and have to take a breather to keep from snapping, take that break and remove yourself.&amp;nbsp; Then go back and resume.
    When the situation is finally resolved, remember to go back and follow up with some conversation about behavior and consequences.

There are times that you will become angry and some of those times are entirely appropriate.&amp;nbsp; Being angry doesn&#39;t make you a bad parent.&amp;nbsp; The difference is what you do with the anger and how you channel it.</body>

<title>How To Say No To Your Child</title>
<body>I don&#39;t know any parents who enjoy saying no to their child.&amp;nbsp; The reality however, is that children need to hear the word as it helps them understand that they can&#39;t have everything that they want and that the world doesn&#39;t revolve around them.&amp;nbsp; In reality, parents with small children have to pretty much revolve around them but the kids don&#39;t have to know that.&amp;nbsp; So&amp;nbsp;here are some things to remember about telling your child no.

    Be clear and firm with your voice when you say it.&amp;nbsp; Kids aren&#39;t stupid and will note any indecision as much as sharks smell blood in the water.
    Take a few seconds&amp;nbsp;to think about things before saying it and be ready to have a simple and legitimate&amp;nbsp;reason.&amp;nbsp; With multiple kids and multiple activities, I&#39;m prone to reflexively saying no in the moment and then have to go back and reconsider if the child responds with a good point.&amp;nbsp; That few seconds of thought can save you from the reputation of going back on a decision.&amp;nbsp;
    One parent taught me that if you&#39;re saying something to stop a child from engaging in a potentially dangerous activity, use stop instead of no.&amp;nbsp; Some kids do understand that the word stop has safety issues involved while the word no has the automatic impression of Dad just saying it because that&#39;s what he says.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve tried it and it actually does make a difference.
    Don&#39;t take it personally if the kids respond with attitude or appear not to like you.&amp;nbsp; Part of being a father is remembering that you&#39;re a grown&#45;up and it&#39;s your job to look at the larger picture.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s irritating, but I can go for days without being liked&amp;nbsp;&#45; C&#39;est la vie.
    Be prepared to repeat yourself and don&#39;t be afraid to apply consequences if the nagging doesn&#39;t stop.&amp;nbsp; If you have a legitimate reason, stick with it.
    That said, as the kids have aged, I&#39;ve tried to offer alternatives when the situation allows.&amp;nbsp; It teaches the kids &#45; over time &#45; that there are other possibilities that can be explored and found acceptable.&amp;nbsp; No, Johnny can&#39;t spend the night because we leave for Grandma&#39;s early tomorrow morning.&amp;nbsp; But he can come by for a while this evening and I&#39;ll take him home.

Kids&amp;nbsp;want what they want and that&#39;s the nature of children.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s our jobs as fathers to temper their wants with the reality of daily life around us.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Fiat:&nbsp; A Car and a Currency</title>
<body>Fiat Currency.&amp;nbsp; Global Reserve Currency.&amp;nbsp; Gold Standard.
You&#39;ve heard terms like these on the news and in the paper, but what exactly do they mean?&amp;nbsp; How does the mess in Greece and Europe relate to what&#39;s happening here and why should I even care?&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re going to spend some bytes in the next several articles laying out the basics of the ongoing financial crisis &#45; no, it never actually went away &#45; and what it means to us.
But first, let me share a true story.
My father once bought a third car because his eldest child, my sister, was now driving.&amp;nbsp; Since he was having what I now recognize as fully blossomed mid&#45;life crisis, he pulled into the driveway one evening in a sporty, low&#45;slung, forest green convertible, proud that he thought he&#39;d bagged a two&#45;fer.&amp;nbsp; This car was a 1973 Fiat Spyder and it looked fabulous, the best that he could afford with the money available.
We soon learned the joke that Fiat was an acronym for &amp;quot;Fix It Again, Tony&amp;quot; and it was a car that demanded unrelenting vigilance and discipline, more than any other vehicle we&#39;d owned.&amp;nbsp; It was a mechanically unforgiving auto and if it wasn&#39;t assiduously maintained it would wind up at the shop.&amp;nbsp; There were still times that it was in the shop despite my father&#39;s best efforts.&amp;nbsp; Because the engine didn&#39;t like the Pennsylvania climate, he kept it in the garage and covered the engine itself with a canvas tarp in cold weather.&amp;nbsp; so the morning routine was the enter the garage, lift the hood and remove the tarp, recite a Hail Mary and then turn the ignition.
This car remained in the family until one winter morning when Mom needed to drive it.&amp;nbsp; She was running late, so she drove the Spyder for a quick run to the local bank.&amp;nbsp; She sat waiting in the drive&#45;thru lane when she noticed the window teller banging on the glass and yelling at her while pointing furiously at the hood.&amp;nbsp; Mom glanced ahead to see that smoke was billowing out from under the hood where the tarp &#45; which she hadn&#39;t removed &#45; was burning.&amp;nbsp; After the tarp caught fire, the engine soon followed and in a quick few minutes, there was a toasted Fiat blocking the bank&#39;s drive&#45;thru lane.
Fiat:&amp;nbsp; A Currency As Well As A Car
The dollar, as are all of the world&#39;s currencies, are fiat currencies;&amp;nbsp; it isn&#39;t an acronym, but actually the Latin term for &amp;quot;faith&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Each is considered a fiat currency because it is backed by the globe&#39;s faith and confidence in the ability and will of that particular country to support it in terms of competitive ability, resources and capacity to service its debt.&amp;nbsp; That faith is demonstrated in the daily global transactions involving the buying and selling of the various currencies.&amp;nbsp; All manner of entities engage in currency transactions &#45; companies, banks, hedge funds, individuals and central banks &#45; and it&#39;s the number at which buyers are willing to pay versus what sellers will accept that the valuation occurs.&amp;nbsp; And with world&#45;wide networked computers, valutation occurs quickly and globally.&amp;nbsp; Because the Norwegian Krone is used by a country with solid governmental finances and an oil exporting economy, the world demonstrates its respect by valuing that currency higher than the Argentina&#39;s, whose government burned international investors by defaulting on its debt.&amp;nbsp; It takes far more Argentinian Pesos to buy one Krone now than it did ten years ago.
And that&#39;s the key to my father&#39;s Fiat and today&#39;s currencies.&amp;nbsp; Fiat currency is based, to a significant degree, upon the perception and faith of others.&amp;nbsp; Maintaining that faith and supporting that perception requires self&#45;discipline and vigilance on the part of the owner to assure that it continues to be deemed worthwhile by others.&amp;nbsp; If a country&#39;s currency gets a poor reputation, like the Italian car, then the global economies vote against it&amp;nbsp;by valuing it less than other currencies.
How Did We Get To a Fiat Currency?
For most of our history, the dollar &#45; like all of the other currencies &#45; was backed by gold and silver and its control was mandated in our Constitution.&amp;nbsp; What that literally meant, after paper notes were issued, was that somebody who held a dollar was able to go into a&amp;nbsp;bank and trade that paper dollar for a fixed amount of metal, either silver or gold.&amp;nbsp; People learned to accept the dollars because the amount of the metal was fixed and also because it was simply easier to carry paper bills than deal in gold.&amp;nbsp; Because the dollar bill was backed by the metal for which it could be exchanged, it had a steady store of value that buoyed the people&#39;s confidence in it as a currency.
This gold standard was a staunch enforcer of discipline upon the international markets.&amp;nbsp; For instance, if America purchased more from England in 1866 than England purchased from America, then England could take all of the dollars that it had received and return them to the US Treasury for an equivalent amount of gold from the American government&#39;s vaults.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, the US government would have less gold than could support the number of its own dollars in circulation, running the risk of default should enough citizens trade paper for bullion.&amp;nbsp; Dollars would have to be withdrawn from circulation and the result would be less money around for the citizenry.&amp;nbsp; So countries had to live within their means or develop new ways to garner wealth.
We&#39;re not finished with the gold standard yet, but we need to cover something else first that makes the final days of the gold standard understandable.
What&#39;s a Global Reserve Currency?
Many live by the rule that simpler is better and that runs to international financial transactions as well.&amp;nbsp; To keep from having to constantly recalculate the value of one currency to another in these transactions, banks and merchants long ago opted to assure that international transactions were usually handled in one currency only.&amp;nbsp; This is referred to as the Global Reserve Currency (GRC) and it&#39;s a role presently held by the dollar because it serves as the medium of exchange for almost all international business transactions.
The status of GRC is bestowed by the world upon that currency which, it is view, is the steadiest and best able to weather the various storms &#45; political, economic, natural &#45; that occur.&amp;nbsp; The dollar became the GRC at the end of the Second World War after a meeting of allied financial ministers at Bretton Woods, after which the subsequent agreement was named.&amp;nbsp; At that time, the US was literally the last country standing after a second global war which devastated dozens of nations and exhausted the country with the existing GRC, Great Britain.&amp;nbsp; It was agreed that going forward, all international transactions would be handled in dollars.
Remember something.&amp;nbsp; The dollar was now the GRC but it was still backed by gold.&amp;nbsp; The dollar&#39;s status as the &amp;quot;anointed one&amp;quot; was only peripherally related to its backing and it had not yet become a fiat currency.&amp;nbsp; At that time, the US had roughly 20000 tons of gold in the government&#39;s vaults.
This system lasted for almost thirty years.&amp;nbsp; And in that time, the country began to persistently run trade and government deficits so that we were sending more dollars overseas than we were bringing in from elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; Our standard of living rose dramatically and we dreamed big dreams and tackled big projects but that meant that periodically, our gold flowed out of Fort Knox.&amp;nbsp; Financing the Vietnam War, the Great Society and Apollo took huge sums of money and those dollars printed were returned by foreigners for gold.&amp;nbsp;
And this was where the gold standard ran into problems.
Gold to Fiat
Somewhere around 1969, the government acknowledged that the US was going to run out of gold if things weren&#39;t brought under control.&amp;nbsp; There was yet another meeting of international finance ministers and they hashed out what&#39;s now referred to as Bretton Woods II.&amp;nbsp; The dollar &#45; still the biggest kid on the block &#45; continued as the GRC but it was agreed that all of the currencies would &amp;quot;float&amp;quot; in valuation against one another.&amp;nbsp; Gold would no longer be used to back the store of value as it once had.&amp;nbsp; Those valuations would be set by tracking transactions within the global markets and&amp;nbsp;updated by computer, which now made this possible.&amp;nbsp; The dollar&#39;s value now floated against other currencies, which was good because we&#39;d lost over half of our gold reserves in the preceding thirty&#45;odd years.&amp;nbsp;
The flip side was that if our country didn&#39;t pay attention, exercise discipline and maintain our fiat, it would eventually become toast as others punished it in the global marketplace.
So What Do You Need To Remember Going Forward?

    The dollar is a fiat currency with a value based solely upon the willingness of people to accept it.&amp;nbsp; That means that perceptions, beliefs and biases play a major role in how well it holds value &#45; especially to pay for things like oil.
    The dollar is the Global Reserve Currency, which means that almost all of the world&#39;s business transactions occur in the dollar.&amp;nbsp; It also means that the dollar&#39;s value is determined not just by folks in this country, but by others throughout the world.
    Financial systems can change and if there&#39;s a pressing enough reason, change relatively quickly.&amp;nbsp; We went through two major changes &#45; Bretton Woods I and II &#45; within a thirty year period.&amp;nbsp; It might seem like a long time personally, but it&#39;s a blink of history&#39;s eye.
    Covering a Fiat with a tarp is ultimately bad for the Fiat.

<title>Fathers and Fear</title>
<body>Dad, do you ever get scared?
I recall asking my own father that question one night before bedtime.&amp;nbsp; My world was scary even without the constant news of inflation and threats of nuclear war with the now&#45;dead Soviet Union.&amp;nbsp; I had a test for which I really hadn&#39;t studied and there was some neo&#45;neanderthal who made my life miserable in the hallways.&amp;nbsp; My gut was twisted and I dreaded bedtime because I knew that immediately afterwards I awoke to a&amp;nbsp;stressful new day.&amp;nbsp;
My own father seemed to be made of an iron core that nothing shook.&amp;nbsp; He took surprise with great steadiness and simply acknowledged the ongoing mantra of doom with equanimity.&amp;nbsp; I might even see him jump on the bed to Motown &#45; a truly surreal moment &#45; but I never once saw him scared.&amp;nbsp; Concerned, perhaps, with his face in a neutral mask when something really big happened.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But I never saw him scared.&amp;nbsp;I was surprised to hear him answer that question with&amp;nbsp;Yes, at times I am.&amp;nbsp; Everybody gets scared, but I think that things are going to be alright.&amp;nbsp; He talked about fear as being something that everybody &#45; everybody &#45; had but he then added that if you stepped back and considered, the fear was generally overstated.&amp;nbsp; It was one of those conversations upon which you later look back and consider as special.&amp;nbsp;
You had to really be there in the mid 1970s to appreciate it.&amp;nbsp; Rising prices and job losses that struck repeatedly.&amp;nbsp; School thermostats turned low enough that I routinely wore my coat in class and even occasionally my gloves.&amp;nbsp; And in the midst of all of this, I asked my father if we would be alright or if we were going to lose our home.&amp;nbsp; His response was that we would be fine and come through this, so you take care of school and let me worry about this.&amp;nbsp; I actually did go upstairs to bed feeling relieved and reassured that things would be alright.
It wasn&#39;t until my adulthood that I learned and understood more of my father.&amp;nbsp; Of the nightmares that routinely awoke him, a chinese infantryman charging him with a bayonet aimed at his stomach; of wrapping himself around a scotch bottle when his full set of teeth were later removed by an army dentist; of having to move in with his grandmother when his own father had a heart attack and lost his house in the midst of the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp;
It&#39;s especially during&amp;nbsp;stressful times like&amp;nbsp;this that I miss the old man and what he taught me.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s fine to be scared and it&#39;s okay to even admit it to our own kids.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s our job to master ourselves and reassure our own children because they both need and deserve to feel secure.&amp;nbsp; Part of that is because they&#39;re our children and we love them and part is because what we teach them by our behavior, our response to adversity, will be passed along to their children.
After our eldest child was born, we took her to visit my folks at our old house.&amp;nbsp; Dad excused himself from the kitchen and several minutes later, returned with a bundle wrapped in a blanket that actually went clank when he put it on the table.&amp;nbsp; He unwrapped the parcel to show three 100 ounce silver bars that he&#39;d purchased in the mid 1970s and kept stored away as insurance in case the economy went to hell.&amp;nbsp; It never did and the bars sat in the attic until he figured that there was a good need for his own grandchild.&amp;nbsp; And that was the final part of the lesson:&amp;nbsp; after admitting the fear and reassuring the kids, work to offset the problem as best you can.

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; An Off-Topic Side Note</title>
<body>As a matter of course, I try to stay on&#45;topic and focus on the message that fathers should do more &#45; and can do more &#45; with the kids and household.&amp;nbsp; I might throw in some family/personal economics and the occasional general economic article but my focus is kids and family.&amp;nbsp; But today is the occasion where I&#39;ll cross that line and touch upon something important but only peripherally related to family and kids.
Despite the absense of greasy smoke and widespread destruction reminiscent of the Second World War, there&#39;s a massive battle being fought in Europe.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a battle waged with electronic bytes and digitized currency transactions but it&#39;s a massive battle nonetheless, waged between the financial elites and the European governments.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a battle over who possesses real control of society, the sovereign governments or what some refer to as the Plutocrats, as engendered by the financial elites of Wall Street hedge funds and global&amp;nbsp;investment banks.&amp;nbsp; At stake presently is the European currency, the Euro.&amp;nbsp; While much of the damage to the Euro still results from the issues that were never resolved at its creation, the fact remains that the currency is under attack by the plutocracy and their&amp;nbsp;various financial instruments.
Why should you care and be aware?

    The Plutocracy &#45; Senior global&amp;nbsp;corporate executives, Wall Street executives and global bankers &#45; believe that they have gained control of significant levers of power within our own government and are able to manipulate our own currency and regulations.&amp;nbsp; The weakness of the SEC and Congress&#39; agreeing to TARP despite the huge opposition of the American people gives weight to their belief.
    The Plutocracy is greedy and seeks to gain wealth at the expense of the people.&amp;nbsp; Removing the Euro removes a currency that threatens the status of the dollar and hence, the power of these Plutocrats.
    If European governments cave in to the Plutocracy, they will be emboldened to finish their project of gaining full and effective control of the currency and economy&amp;nbsp;in this country.&amp;nbsp;
    This means that the great mass of our children will become nothing more than the financial equivalents of modern&#45;day serfs, working at low&#45;wage jobs to support a credit&#45;driven society that ultimately enriches the few who control the banks and funds that govern the country through their paid&#45;for representatives.

If you had told me two years ago that I&#39;d be writing this, I would have honestly said that you were nuts.&amp;nbsp; But my children &#45; our children &#45; deserve better than what is promised by such a future.&amp;nbsp; And there is precedence for such a struggle in our own history.&amp;nbsp; The Depression of 1837 &#45; notably remembered by the song Hard Times, written by Stephen Foster to describe the suffering &#45;&amp;nbsp; was a result of the conflict between President Andrew Jackson and a banker named Nicholas Biddle, who controlled the Bank of the United States.&amp;nbsp; The Sherman Anti&#45;Trust Act was later wielded by President Theodore Roosevelt to assault the Robber Barons, who controlled railroads and industry instead of banks.
So start to pay attention and exercise your right to speak and vote as you see fit.&amp;nbsp; Understand that there&#39;s going to be real economic hardship ahead and that it will be our responsibility to bring our families through it.&amp;nbsp;
But this isn&#39;t the first time this has occurred and if we&#39;re fortunate, it won&#39;t be the last either.</body>

<title>PracticalDad&#8217;s Crap-o-meter:&nbsp; Teaching Critical Thinking Skills</title>
<body>Some people say that common sense &#45; which I define as the ability to think critically&amp;nbsp;&#45;&amp;nbsp;can&#39;t be taught and to an extent, that&#39;s true.&amp;nbsp; But while some are more blessed with a healthy dose of common sense than others, fathers can help the kids learn to exercise critical thinking skills throughout their youth.&amp;nbsp; Part of my job is to help the child develop their own native crap&#45;o&#45;meter, or what my own father delicately referred to as the Bullshit Detector.
I marvelled at my own father&#39;s ability to dissect an issue, idea or advertisement and never found myself able to reach his level.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My mother was also blessed with a broad streak of common sense but didn&#39;t express it as analytically as he did.&amp;nbsp; But after years as a commercial multi&#45;line claims adjuster &#45; an adjuster who specializes in property, liability and worker&#39;s compensation losses &#45; I realized that listening to enough truth&#45;bending and outright lying developed my own detector to a level that approached my father&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; You might say that it&#39;s just an unhealthy skepticism and disbelief but to get at the heart of a matter, you have to move past skepticism and ask whether something actually makes sense; if not, where&#39;s the failure?
I started when they were at an early age by messing with them when we talked and making outrageously non&#45;sensical comments.&amp;nbsp; Gee, Elmo&#39;s looking rather green today.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s not?&amp;nbsp; How can you tell and what makes you right?&amp;nbsp; This has progressed through the years so that the kids are usually able to tell when I&#39;m bluffing even if they aren&#39;t sure why.&amp;nbsp; Well, two of the three but even that one&#39;s making progress.&amp;nbsp; And occasionally, I&#39;ll come across something that makes me scratch my head and decide to bring it up for educational purposes.
Tonight&#39;s foray into PracticalDad&#39;s Crap&#45;o&#45;meter is a Yahoo article about Sears/Kmart&#39;s new offering of a cash&#45;for&#45;gold service.&amp;nbsp; In an effort to make their products continually affordable to cash&#45;strapped consumers, Sears Holdings is offering a service in which spare gold jewelry and items can be sent to a vendor in return for cash.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ve thoughtfully provided pre&#45;printed envelopes for the items as well as a tracking mechanism to assure that&amp;nbsp;the transaction doesn&#39;t get lost.&amp;nbsp; But my questions and the resulting conversation will hopefully touch upon certain points.

    Why would Sears/Kmart offer such a service and why does the cash delivery have to occur within the confines of that particular store?&amp;nbsp; Because they want to provide money for folks who need it.&amp;nbsp; And some of&amp;nbsp;those needs can be met within their store.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If not, impulse buying will hopefully occur because that&#39;s why there&#39;s target marketing.
    What else does Sears/Kmart get out of it besides oodles of goodwill and maybe some sales?&amp;nbsp; Well, how does the gold vendor make money?&amp;nbsp; And if they make money on a percentage cut from the transaction, will they have to share some of the cut with Sears/Kmart for the privilege of making it available within the store?&amp;nbsp; And how much bigger does that cut have to be to make it worthwhile for both parties involved?
    For that matter, is all gold even created equal?&amp;nbsp; Gee, do you know that the amount you&#39;d get for the 10k bracelet is less than I&#39;d get for the 14k wedding ring purchased from a high&#45;end Virginia jeweler?&amp;nbsp;
    What&#39;s gold worth anyways?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s increasing in value or what it might be buy if it were dollars?&amp;nbsp; If that&#39;s so, why would you trade it in to purchase items at a Kmart?

My goal is to actually make them answer the questions, even if there&#39;s silence for a bit.&amp;nbsp; I might have to explain some things but the great effort is to have them talk and not just sit listening while Dad carries on a monologue.
The larger idea of picking apart and reviewing an idea or program isn&#39;t likely to take root immediately.&amp;nbsp; But with time and persistence, they&#39;ll get the hang of it and hopefully avoid some of the mistakes that snag so many others.</body>

<body>Sometimes it takes tripping over one small tree to make you notice the forest around you.&amp;nbsp; In this particular instance, a game of Fiki football&amp;nbsp;was the catalyst to realizing just how many small activities and&amp;nbsp;skills are being lost due to the failure of fathers to pass them along to the kids.&amp;nbsp; And believe me, business has noticed as they&#39;ve taken up the slack and made money in the process.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re outsourcing fatherhood.
Fiki &#45; Flick It Kick It &#45; football is a cheap little game available at Five&#45;Below, a glorified dollar store that caters to tweens and teens with individually minimal amounts to spend.&amp;nbsp; Along with a thinly stuffed leather triangle is a plastic football goalpost attached to a base.&amp;nbsp; The point is to take turns flicking the triangle across the table and if the triangle stops with any part of it extending over the opposite edge &#45; your opponent&#39;s goalline &#45; then you score a touchdown.&amp;nbsp; Then kick it through the uprights and you score the extra point.&amp;nbsp; What struck me was that this is the exact game that we played on the cafeteria table after lunch thirty plus years ago.&amp;nbsp; Almost any of us could make a triangle out of notebook paper, with the ends tucked into folds, and proceed with play.&amp;nbsp; The goalpost was made by touching the opposing index fingers then holding the thumbs upwards.&amp;nbsp; But this never made it to the next generation and now some enterprising nebbish is profiting from it.
Other companies are profiting from this loss of institutional fatherhood knowledge.&amp;nbsp; Home Depot and Lowes regularly have Saturday morning classes for kids, showing them how to do basic woodcrafts like birdhouses and pinewood derby cars.&amp;nbsp; Things are nicely arranged and laid out in the workarea, typically located near the tools that the farsighted marketers hope to eventually sell to the 3 &#45; 5% of kids who take up this type of hobby.&amp;nbsp; Kids might be there with a parent or they might be left in the charge of the employee while the parent shops.&amp;nbsp; If the kid has a parent there, it&#39;s probably a parent &#45; father or mother &#45; who has minimal access to tools and/or little knowledge of what to do.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, there was recently a series of books for boys and girls with activities that were fun, cheap and popular in previous generations.&amp;nbsp; Authors and publishers have realized that there&#39;s money to be made here and are pursuing it.
Not all of this loss can be pegged to fatherhood alone.&amp;nbsp; There was a time when kids were together enough that they passed childhood&#39;s institutional knowledge to one another, and that amounted to the imagination and games.&amp;nbsp; But other knowledge isn&#39;t being passed along by fathers, either due to not having learned it during their own youth, fear or self&#45;absorption.&amp;nbsp;
This is why we&#39;re outsourcing fatherhood and turning it over to those who largely have no interest apart from profit.&amp;nbsp; The divorce rate in the past several decades, climaxing at nearly 50% of marriages in the early 1990s, has left many men without the fatherhood model upon which to draw in their own experience as a father.&amp;nbsp; Their lack of a father to share this knowledge has deprived them of that same knowledge to pass to their own children.&amp;nbsp; This is compounded by the fear that their own failed efforts will lead to embarrassment in front of the kids and the self&#45;absorption of many men in their own activities.
Fathers have to do more with the kids.&amp;nbsp; This doesn&#39;t mean that they should pick up tools with which they have no familiarity and have at it, but instead focus on what they do know and work on sharing that.&amp;nbsp; Sports, hunting, tinkering, whatever it takes &#45; just utilize it and pass it along to the kids.&amp;nbsp; And as to fear, follow the old adage that if you don&#39;t mention you&#39;re unfamiliar, they won&#39;t notice unless you say something.&amp;nbsp;
Then go out and improve as you go.

<title>I Can&#8217;t Right Now, I Have to Work:&nbsp; Playing With The Kids</title>
<body>As kids grow and the schedule tightens, it&#39;s easy to say &#39;no&#39; to a child who wants to play.&amp;nbsp; There is a long list of items to be checked in a finite period of time and that leaves little room for play.&amp;nbsp; But the reality is that playing with your child might be play for him &#45; or her &#45; but it&#39;s actually an important part of a father&#39;s responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; Well, mothers as well but it seems to fall more into the realm of fathers.
That was the case this past Saturday morning as I sat at the laptop and tried to write for the site.&amp;nbsp; We have guidelines on when the Saturday morning television can be turned on and I came downstairs to find Youngest ensconced in front of Cartoon Network.&amp;nbsp; After I said something, Youngest turned off the television and approached, asking if I wanted to play Fiki Football with him.&amp;nbsp; My initial response was a firm no but as I looked at his face and considered that I was sitting in front of a laptop on a Saturday morning, I changed my mind and cleared the kitchen table for the game.&amp;nbsp; It lasted for the better part of a half&#45;hour and the accompanying conversation veered to school and classmates as well as the best technique for kicking the football.
Making sure that you play with the kids is actually important for multiple reasons.

    It reinforces the sense that they do matter and are important, which is crucial in these days of harried schedules and blown&#45;to&#45;hell family meals.
    It builds a bond that can help move beyond the communications problems that often develop as they age and push their limits.&amp;nbsp; On more than one occasion, I&#39;ve found myself playing Horse at the driveway hoop with Eldest after undergoing several hours of parent/teen tension.&amp;nbsp;
    The conversation that results from shooting hoops or playing a board game can be revealing to what&#39;s inside their heads and lives at the moment.&amp;nbsp; In Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie writes in the first chapter about the typical mother&#39;s habit of tidying up the child&#39;s mind after bedtime and removing or placing the clutter.&amp;nbsp; The point is that this provides you the opportunity to see what&#39;s on their mind.
    A regular habit of playing with the kids creates an opportunity for them to unburden because they feel more relaxed with your presence.&amp;nbsp; More than one conversation about sex and behavior has arisen from just playing some game with the kids.
    It helps you teach good manners and honesty when they&#39;re young.&amp;nbsp; You can address cheating and sportsmanship issues early so that it doesn&#39;t become ingrained.&amp;nbsp; I realized that if I was called away to the phone during a game of Candyland, one of my kids would reshuffle the card deck so that the next card that I drew was Plumpy while her card was Queen Frostine.&amp;nbsp; I became suspicious after two occurrences and finally confronted her when I was comfortable that that was the situation.
    It helps you determine what areas of development need addressed.&amp;nbsp; How are the fine motor skills &#45; drawing and using scissors &#45; versus the gross motor skills?&amp;nbsp; Is there an issue with vision or balance?
    It&#39;s simply just fun.&amp;nbsp; Spending time with a board game or basketball helps them learn to pass the time without having to spend money or involve themselves even further with electronics which are sometimes both violent and/or noisy.

It&#39;s important to keep a roof over the head and food on the table.&amp;nbsp; But raising the kids well is vitally important and&amp;nbsp;play is an often neglected part of that job.

<title>&#8220;Do I Have To Go?&#8221;&nbsp; Taking the Kids Along</title>
<body>By the time the kids are in preschool, they&#39;re starting different activities and sports and it&#39;s a no&#45;brainer to take the other kids along.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re also young and they have no choice in the matter.&amp;nbsp; But as they age and finally reach a point at which they can reliably be left home alone &#45; and trust me, I&#39;ve heard some hilarious stories of teens at home &#45; they&#39;ll assume that they don&#39;t have to go along.&amp;nbsp; And you&#39;ll hear the ageless query do I have to go? when you suggest that they go too.
What are some guidelines on whether to take the older kids?&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s what we do.

    If the child is old enough to be alone and it&#39;s a practice, then we let them stay home.&amp;nbsp; The proviso is that any homework must be done (and checked) and if there&#39;s a chore to do, get it done.&amp;nbsp; If you have to stay &#45; which happens with the baseball practice due to distance &#45; then you&#39;ll just be reading or doing paperwork anyways.
    If the event is an actual game or concert, then we overlook the rolled eyes and have the kids come along.&amp;nbsp; They might not actually pay attention during the event, especially if it&#39;s an outside sport with room to run, but they&#39;ll usually check in to ascertain how sibling&#39;s doing before returning to play.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s a concert, then it&#39;s another opportunity to learn how to sit quietly and learn the art of patience.&amp;nbsp; The idea is that they at least become used to the idea as a way to show support, even if they initially &#45; and realistically &#45; aren&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; But as the habit sinks in and they age, they&#39;ll spend more time watching and actually cheering for one another.&amp;nbsp;
    When the child is older and it pertains to a younger sibling, I&#39;ve even provided a rationale that was hard to resist.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s years between the two of you and as he ages, you won&#39;t be here to see and cheer.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;ll miss you and you&#39;re going to miss everything that he&#39;ll do through that time.&amp;nbsp; But every time that we come to see what&amp;nbsp; you&#39;re doing, he&#39;ll be along so take advantage of these events now.&amp;nbsp; In both cases of elder siblings, they&#39;ve nodded and acquiesced to coming; they even cheered.

It&#39;s irritating to have to contend with the deep sighs and rolled eyes.&amp;nbsp; But it&#39;s important to hold the family line because kids need to know that they indeed matter.&amp;nbsp; Like many things with children, these practices take considerable time and attention before they actually take root into a deeper&amp;nbsp;sense that holds a family together as it grows and ages.</body>

<title>Managing the Chaos:&nbsp; Food</title>
<body>With three kids and three separate sports &#45; soccer, volleyball/dance, and baseball respectively by age &#45; the spring season is simply chaos.&amp;nbsp; So how to manage getting everybody fed in a decent manner, especially if Eldest is a serious vegetarian?
Yes, there are nights when fast food is simply the only alternative, but there are times when the wallet and body need a break from that alternative.&amp;nbsp; So yesterday was a rummage through the fridge to see what was available and the following plan ensued.
1.&amp;nbsp; Yesterday:&amp;nbsp; Thaw and cook a frozen turkey breast, cutting the meat off and freezing the majority while reserving some for sandwiches and soup.&amp;nbsp; The turkey carcass was wrapped in plastic and saved until this morning.&amp;nbsp; I also noted that there are 8&amp;quot; tortillas and cheese slices in the fridge along with lettuce.
2.&amp;nbsp; Today:&amp;nbsp; Using an easy recipe found online, toss the carcass in a large pot with a quartered onion and garlic salt and boil/simmer for about 90 minutes.&amp;nbsp; Then precut all of the remaining vegetables and add the spices in a small bowl for later addition to the soup after the carcass is removed.&amp;nbsp; As for vegetarian eldest, save some chopped vegetables and add to the lettuce so that the mix can be used with the cheese and tortilla to make a vegetarian wrap.
So as the various parties come and go, the food is ready for easy eating before everybody hits the door for where they have to go.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not pretty and the traditional sit&#45;down family meal is blown to hell and back, but it&#39;s cheaper and healthier than a constant diet of fries and burgers &#45; and fish sandwiches for the vegetarian.

<title>How Much Of My Youth Do I Share With The Kids?</title>
<body>Kids are egocentric and so far as they&#39;re concerned, your old life died with their birth&amp;nbsp;but as they age, they can become more curious.&amp;nbsp; They want to hear stories about the family and knowing family history strengthens their sense of self and being a part of something larger.&amp;nbsp; But just&amp;nbsp; how much, especially with this parental generation&#39;s use of recreational drugs and casual sex, should you actually reveal about yourself?&amp;nbsp; Because somewhere in that adolescent brain, your past activity will be viewed as a tacit approval for dangerous or unacceptable behavior.
This was brought home by one of my kid&#39;s questions last week:&amp;nbsp; Dad, were you a playah?&amp;nbsp; When I&#39;m surprised &#45; and I really was at this one &#45; I always try to determine what&#39;s prompting the question.&amp;nbsp; Why would you think that I was?&amp;nbsp; The subsequent exchange revealed that it was rooted in an earlier conversation between my boy and his best friend, who&#39;s akin to an adoptive son as well.&amp;nbsp; In the course of family conversations about dating, I&#39;ve been frank that I was raised with the attitude of &amp;quot;date &#39;em all&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve also been clear as they aged that dating isn&#39;t synonymous with sleeping with said dates.&amp;nbsp; But this part has been selectively forgotten and now I had to go back and clarify things again.
I&#39;m fortunate that my past is pretty clear.&amp;nbsp; I was the guy who got more than one woman out of trouble in college by assuring that she was removed from a situation before there were even greater regrets and I was typically &amp;quot;the brother figure&amp;quot; to many women.&amp;nbsp; I reiterated this to the teen but he kept hammering on the question of being a &amp;quot;playah&amp;quot; and it occurred to me that the other part of the question pertained to virginity.&amp;nbsp; I resisted the question further but as we went back and forth, I began to fear that failure to respond in this age of &amp;quot;friends with benefits&amp;quot; would be tantamount to confirming that I was sexually active as an early teen.&amp;nbsp; The mental compromise was simple.&amp;nbsp; Because you won&#39;t stop, all I&#39;ll say is that I was much older than you are.&amp;nbsp; His response was dramatic, demanding to know why I&#39;d tell him that and that he didn&#39;t want to know.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d cracked the box and given him a glimpse of a father as a man before his children came into the world.
How you answer questions about your past is your choice.&amp;nbsp; I know people who have lied to their children about their past and I even have a family history of forebears lying about an out&#45;of&#45;wedlock birth.&amp;nbsp; I also know those who have been open about their experiences and accepted the discomfort that comes with acknowledging past behaviors.&amp;nbsp; Whichever route you select, remember certain things.

    Kids want to look up to their fathers and respect them, unlike what&#39;s depicted on television and in the media, so always consider what you choose to reveal about your past behaviors and habits.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t know until I was an adult that if my own father were my son, I&#39;d have had him shot.
    Expect to spend time out of your comfort zone when talking with the kids about issues, especially when it pertains to sexual behavior.&amp;nbsp; This is conversation that you must have since they won&#39;t receive any moral perspective discussing it amongst their peers.
    Always offer a moral perspective to any conversation that you have with the kids.&amp;nbsp; It isn&#39;t just about being religious, it&#39;s helping them build a framework through which they can make the value judgments which are part of life.
    Always offer a practical assessment of the risks that can arise from situations.&amp;nbsp; Teens have a notoriously bad ability to assess risk and considering potential consequences with them can be instructive for both of you.

Since then, I&#39;ve reiterated with my son that I won&#39;t provide answers to specific questions since it&#39;s none of his business.&amp;nbsp; And he&#39;s learned that if you don&#39;t think that you&#39;re going to like the answer, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t ask the question.</body>

<title>Another Look At Praising Your Child</title>
<body>Several months ago I wrote about the difference between praising your child and overpraising him.&amp;nbsp; But in reviewing a recent article in Scouting Magazine, I came across a different perspective from psychologist Carol Dweck.
In her research on the effects of praise, she believed that there was a qualitative difference in the form of praise.&amp;nbsp; The first form was &amp;quot;person praise&amp;quot;, in which a child is praised for their own traits (you&#39;re really smart or you&#39;re beautiful) while the second form was &amp;quot;process praise&amp;quot;, in which a child was praised for the process in which they did something well (you did a great job studying for that test).&amp;nbsp; Her research revealed that there was a quantifiable difference in how the two groups &#45; each receiving its own form, personal or process &#45; did on similar tests.&amp;nbsp;
In a two part experiment, students who were provided with identical IQ tests on which they all scored well.&amp;nbsp; But afterward, one half of the group received person praise while the second half received process praise.&amp;nbsp; In a subsequent part, the students were allowed to choose which of two tests they wanted to take &#45; and there was a discernible difference between the difficulty levels of the tests.&amp;nbsp; The majority of the person praise group chose the easier test while an overwhelming majority &#45; think 90% &#45; of the process praise group chose the harder exam.&amp;nbsp; Subsequent interviews found that the person praise group feared that the test would negatively affect their image, i.e. they wouldn&#39;t appear as smart.&amp;nbsp; Finally, each group was given an identical test and the person praise group did discernibly worse than the process praise group.&amp;nbsp; In this instance, the person praise group scored 20% worse than the first test while the process group scored 30% better than the first test.&amp;nbsp; With a testing group of 400 kids, this appears to be significant.
So what does this mean?&amp;nbsp; First, you simply must pay attention to what the kids are doing and share with them that you&#39;re paying attention.&amp;nbsp; Kids aren&#39;t stupid and can tell a line of bull from the truth.&amp;nbsp; Second, offer praise that focuses on what they&#39;ve done.&amp;nbsp; You can still tell them that they&#39;re smart but if they understand that the success comes from the combination of smarts and applying themselves, it will help them build the drive to succeed and overcome obstacles later in their lives.&amp;nbsp; Focusing on the process also helps them understand where things did &#45; or did not &#45; work well in the particular circumstance.
As the psychologist notes in the article, &amp;quot;We cannot hand children self&#45;esteem on a silver platter, which is what we&#39;re trying to do with person praise.&amp;nbsp; What you can do is give them the tools to manage their own self&#45;esteem, to take on challenges and see them through, to build and maintain their own self&#45;esteem.&amp;quot;
Which is probably far better said than I could say myself.&amp;nbsp;</body>

<title>Let Time Pass But Don&#8217;t Pass The Time</title>
<body>I stopped by Eldest&#39;s room late&amp;nbsp;last&amp;nbsp;evening to answer a question that I asked myself almost exactly sixteen years ago.&amp;nbsp; Today is her birthday and on the morning that she was born, I looked at this infant &#45; graced with more hair than I had and&amp;nbsp;a clear resemblance to her mother &#45; and&amp;nbsp;wondered what she might look like when it came time for that milestone, her driver&#39;s license.&amp;nbsp;
That was&amp;nbsp;exactly 5840 days ago and at that moment, it really seemed like forever.&amp;nbsp; There were so many things to work through and learn such as feeding and changing this child, and managing to get her down for sleep without having to depend upon her mother.&amp;nbsp; But with time and persistence, I learned and the process still continues albeit with a different bent.&amp;nbsp; Should I rebid the auto insurance now that I&#39;m going to have a teen driver on the policy and what discounts can I get for driving lessons?&amp;nbsp; What are the household driving rules, which are in addition to the road rules?
The point is that time does indeed pass and your child will reach adulthood, with or without you.&amp;nbsp; But the quality of that adulthood is also however, largely dependent upon your efforts and imputs.&amp;nbsp; I guarantee that there will be mistakes and that you&#39;ll have regrets but children have a wonderful ability to forgive, one that many of us have lost.&amp;nbsp; Learn from the mistakes and rectify them but by all means, stay involved and engage the kids in all aspects of their lives.&amp;nbsp; Regardless whether you&#39;re a father or a mother, raising kids is like one long golfer&#39;s Mulligan.&amp;nbsp; There will be mistakes but there will be opportunities to make them right if you pay attention and stay with it.
As I finish this note, I&#39;m wondering what she&#39;ll look like on her wedding day.&amp;nbsp; But there&#39;s still a great deal to do until we get to that point.

<title>Kids and Sleep:&nbsp; The Teens</title>
<body>From the time that your child is born through the later elementary school years, she&#39;ll need a little less sleep each year until she bottoms out at about 8 &#45; 9 hours each night.&amp;nbsp; Bedtimes will be mid&#45;evening and she&#39;ll be up and moving at a relatively early hour each morning.&amp;nbsp; But that amount of nightly sleep required will rise as her body &#45; and his if you have a boy &#45; runs aground on the shoals of puberty.
Kids need more sleep as they enter the teen years with the optimal amount being about 9.5 hours each&amp;nbsp;night.&amp;nbsp; Most are unaware that many of the key body chemicals and hormones for growth and development are released by the body during sleep.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the combination of technology/environment and the teen&#39;s body itself works against most teens getting that amount of sleep on a routine basis.&amp;nbsp; Most teens&#39; bedrooms are a technological cocoon with the presence of television, stereo, radio, phone and computer.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ve become used to the technological &#39;noise&#39; and don&#39;t want to separate themselves from the electronic presence of friends available via the media sources or don&#39;t wish to turn off the &#39;noise&#39; with which they&#39;re now comfortable.&amp;nbsp; Faced with an early school day, the typical teen is operating on a sleep deficit as the bedtime isn&#39;t until much later than a 9.5 hour optimal sleep amount would account for.&amp;nbsp; Assuming that a teen has to rise at about 6:30 in order to prepare and arrive at school on time, the ideal teen bedtime would be about 9:00 the previous evening.
Good luck with that.
Life with a teen tends to be an emotional rollercoaster fraught with churlish turns and attitudinal drops.&amp;nbsp; Honestly, it becomes a bit more difficult for some parents because the evening break that came with an earlier bedtime is now gone and there&#39;s no longer a perceived&amp;nbsp;relief.&amp;nbsp; It can be easier to blame the desire to stay up later on rebellion and resistance but their late night habits do have a scientific basis.&amp;nbsp; Humans have a &amp;quot;darkness hormone&amp;quot; called melatonin that the body begins to produce in the evening to relax itself and prepare itself for sleep.&amp;nbsp; Studies have found that this hormone starts production in the typical adult at about 10:00 in the evening.&amp;nbsp; The typical teen body however, doesn&#39;t begin production of this hormone until almost 1:00 am, a full three hours later.&amp;nbsp; So the teen&#39;s body isn&#39;t close to being ready to shut down until much later while still facing an early morning wakeup for school.&amp;nbsp; The question about delayed&amp;nbsp;melatonin production however, is causal.&amp;nbsp; Is it due to the hormonal chaos of puberty or instead environmentally delayed by the ambient light produced by the various screens within the teens&#39; bedrooms?&amp;nbsp; Nobody frankly knows.
So what are the options?&amp;nbsp; We try to walk the middle ground and not enforce an &amp;quot;early&amp;quot; bedtime that ensures the full 9.5 hours nightly since there&#39;s going to be enough potential conflict without it.&amp;nbsp; However, the teens are expected &#45; and required when we catch them &#45; to have&amp;nbsp;the interactive&amp;nbsp;electronics(texting in our case)&amp;nbsp;off at a certain hour before bed so that their bodies have a chance to relax.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re helped by the fact that we&#39;ve never allowed televisions or computers in their rooms but they do have music available as we did when we were teens.&amp;nbsp; The principle is the same but the only difference is the technology platform.&amp;nbsp; This means that&amp;nbsp;we check on them around bedtime and occasionally afterwards to assure that they&#39;re sans electronics.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;know of other parents who&#39;ve routinely confiscated cell phones at a certain hour&amp;nbsp;each evening to assure that the texting is done or who&#39;ve removed the televisions if they&#39;re found in use after hours.&amp;nbsp; It ensures that there&#39;s going to be conflict, but some is to be expected as the teens test their limits.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, refusing to abide by parental rules is always grounds for a worthwhile conflict since parents should expect to be obeyed if the rules are reasonable and fairly enforced.&amp;nbsp;
Teens are able to absorb information and knowledge at an amazing rate and I&#39;m routinely surprised by what my kids know.&amp;nbsp; But knowledge isn&#39;t the same as judgment.

<title>Kids and Sleep:&nbsp; Infancy Through Elementary School</title>
<body>One of the great lessons that I had to learn as a new father was that my life was no longer my own, and that pertained to all of its facets.&amp;nbsp; This especially included sleep, which became far more dear than I ever realized it could.&amp;nbsp; So what can you expect from the typical child as she moves through life&#39;s pipeline?
While no child is alike, their bodies have similar needs and the following chart summarizes what the typical child/teen needs in terms of hours of daily sleep.

Bear in mind that the first several months will appear chaotic as the child will sleep intermittently and wake regularly through the night for feeding.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s your job &#45; both Mom and Dad &#45; through these months to help your infant adapt to a regular schedule that includes sleeping through the night without feeding and obtaining sufficient and routine naps.&amp;nbsp; But the upshot for many is that during that first year, the night&#45;time feedings will disappear and the child will begin to nap regularly &#45; you might not believe it while in the midst of the chaos, but it will happen.
After about three years of age, the naps will disappear and your child will still need significantly more sleep than you but this will diminish as well.&amp;nbsp;
Still, nightly bedtimes and routines&amp;nbsp;matter.&amp;nbsp; They help the child&#39;s body learn to prepare for sleep and your child will usually look forward to the wind&#45;down from the day.&amp;nbsp; My youngest is still in elementary school and one of the best parts of that pre&#45;teen age is that the bedtimes are earlier, which permits me some of my own quiet time after a full day of work and the normalized chaos that comes from children.
That changes however, when the kids reach the teen years.&amp;nbsp; Then the needs change, as well as the surrounding environment.</body>

<title>Keeping Up With The Kids&#8217; Electronics</title>
<body>I&#39;ve always spent considerable time trying to keep tabs on the media environment that&#39;s surrounding the kids.&amp;nbsp; I can try to limit the television and computer time, but there are still other screens and devices to focus their attention and I generally take the random sampling approach.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s simple when the media in question is in a public area, such as the television and the family computer.
But how&amp;nbsp;do I not appear heavy&#45;handed when approaching the personal devices, such as the iPod and the mp3 player?&amp;nbsp; Some of the lyrics are short&#45;term harmless but long&#45;term corrosive to the &#39;tween/teen attitude and psyche.

    Make your own mp3 or iPod available for sharing with the kids.&amp;nbsp; Hey, you wanna hear some real music, try this!&amp;nbsp; Then swap devices and take a little cruise.&amp;nbsp; It has been effective in giving me a glimpse of what they&#39;re listening to and whether I should be concerned.&amp;nbsp; I was truly surprised to find that Eldest had a selection of Etta James pieces from the 1950s on her iPod.
    Pay attention to what you see them playing on Youtube or the various websites, then take some moments to visit some of the other offerings by that group.&amp;nbsp; The upshot is that you do have to act on it if seems extreme.&amp;nbsp; In one instance here, Killer Clown Posse has been banned, inasmuch as I can do so.&amp;nbsp; The discussion with one of the teens pertained to the question of how cool something could be when the video acts out sniper attacks on innocents.&amp;nbsp; I was frank in evoking the Columbine massacre as well as the more recent Amish School Nickel Mines shooting and the teen in question has acknowledged the point.
    Visit the websites for favorite stations and view the playlists for most requested songs.&amp;nbsp; Then check a sample against the on&#45;line lyrics from sites such as Lyrics.com&amp;nbsp;and read them.&amp;nbsp; There are opportunities &#45; if you&#39;re willing to make them &#45; to discuss the songs with the kids and if things are bad enough, then you have to be willing to force the issue.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s unpleasant to confront a teen about burning highly objectionable discs but the reality is that it has to happen.&amp;nbsp;
    Use technology to turn the private media into public media.&amp;nbsp; A friend recently told me that there are devices that be used to hook the mp3 or iPod up to the car radio and I&#39;ll investigate that this weekend.&amp;nbsp; I believe that the kids do want to hear things on the air versus having to wear earbuds and I&#39;m willing to invest in such technology.&amp;nbsp;

When the average kid is spending hours each day saturated by the electronic media, then something unpleasant &#45; photo, lyric or otherwise &#45; is going to leech through to the kids.&amp;nbsp; But casting a wide net into the electronic sea at least gives you an insight into the waters in which they swim.
And whether you also need to jump in as well.</body>

<title>PracticalDad:&nbsp; Accountability, Discipline and Teens</title>
<body>Kids grow, age and change and we expect that.&amp;nbsp; One of the great challenges of being a parent is adapting&amp;nbsp;while still being consistent within the adaptation, just like a parent trying to be flexible within the daily schedule while still maintaining a sense of structure.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s no different for discipline&amp;nbsp; than it is for anything else and in fact, it&#39;s probably more difficult for discipline since the heart of discipline is teaching the child and that child is going to push more and more of your buttons as she ages.
When the kids are smaller, you&#39;re around them more and the environments are much more controlled.&amp;nbsp; You can keep an eye on them and their activities and things are much more of a known quantity.&amp;nbsp; You have a decent sense of the risks, hazards and temptations.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll still come up with new twists that catch you off&#45;guard but if you think like a kid, you start to anticipate what can happen.
Temptations and situations develop when they enter a larger environment.&amp;nbsp; More kids from other families &#45; each family with its own values and priorities &#45; and new surroundings mean that the parents must stretch their attention span; what new challenges can arise and what should the response be when they do?
But discipline becomes a real challenge when the kids reach the point that they&#39;re more aware and think that they&#39;re&amp;nbsp;smarter than &amp;quot;the &#39;rents&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp; Rules will be questioned &#45; sometimes rightfully &#45; and the opportunity is now there to pursue actions and behaviors that are potentially self&#45;destructive.&amp;nbsp; Now discipline can almost reach the point of being akin to a military campaign.&amp;nbsp; You have to observe and question, demand details and parse through commentary that appears straightforward to the addled teen brain but is actually short of real information.&amp;nbsp; You then have to work to channel them to the options that are in their best interests and that can involve maintaining a considerable and extended period of pressure to assure their compliance.&amp;nbsp; It can be unpleasant and lead to&amp;nbsp;discord within the household; the child is unhappy having to comply with a semi&#45;senile old coot and you&#39;re unhappy too.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s unpleasant being considered &amp;quot;the bad guy&amp;quot; and equally unpleasant enforcing accountability, especially if it means that something in which the child excels is being withheld to assure compliance.
Over the long term, it&#39;s easy to become discouraged and doubt yourself.&amp;nbsp; Expect mistakes, by both you and the child, and correct them accordingly.&amp;nbsp; But remember that you&#39;re the parent and have a much larger knowledge base as well as the responsibility to help this kid reach a productive adulthood.&amp;nbsp; And then gear up for a potentially protracted campaign.</body>
