 <title>-Isms and the Kids</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There are moments when my internal eyebrows arch upwards like a giant McDonald's sign and one of those moments occurred this past Spring when Youngest came home from middle school and pulled a book, lent to him by a buddy, out of his backpack.&nbsp; We had begun chatting and he produced the paperback with the comment that his buddy was a big fan.&nbsp;: The book?&nbsp; Marx' <em>The Communist Manifesto</em>.&nbsp; </content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - September 2016:&nbsp; The Potemkin Village Shelves</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Another month of pricing for the PracticalDad Price Index is finished and the results for September, 2016 are calculated.&nbsp; The Total Index, comprising the full 47 item <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index - November 2010">market-basket</a>, declined in September to 98.28 from August's 100.19, a full 1.91 basis points (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; The 37 item Food-only Sub-Index, comprising the 37 foodstuff items within the basket, dropped even more significantly from August; the September Sub-Index was 97.26, down 2.48 basis points from August's index of 99.74 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; This is one of the largest swings in either direction in the almost six year history of the PracticalDad Price Index.</p>
<p>Here's a little perspective.&nbsp; I began the Index in November 2010, in the midst of the Fed's QE2 Program and both Index and Sub-Index climbed until they peaked in January 2015 (111.32) and December 2014 (115.13) respectively.&nbsp; This was shortly after QE3 ended in late October 2014.&nbsp; It took more than four years to induce these apogees but without the stimulus provided by the Fed's programs however, deflation has ground away and the both Indices have literally collapsed.&nbsp; The cost of the full market-basket was actually less in June 2016 than at the outset of the project and the food-stuffs segment likewise reached that point in July 2016, a month later.</p>
<p>One of the things that I've noticed <a href="http://www,practicaldad.com/index.php/article/796" title="PracticalDad Price Index - May 2016/Start Watching the Shelves">while pricing for the past several months</a> has been the quantity of items on the shelves and by extension, the condition of the grocery supply chain.&nbsp; This is in terms both of the seeming appearance of more widely spaced shelves and also the periodic disappearance of items from the shelves completely.&nbsp; It's not like the photos of desolate shelves pre-hurricane or even the absolute disappearance of product <em>a la </em> 2016 Venezuela, but it's little things.&nbsp; A particular item will be gone for a month or two - not just unstocked but with even the shelf label gone - only to reappear later; in multiple instances, the item has not only returned but been supplemented by an even lower-cost alternative, what economists refer to as an <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inferior-good.asp" title="investopedia.com">inferior good</a>.&nbsp; When this has shown to be consistent in the subsequent months, I have have made note and replaced the store-brand with the inferior item in the index pricing.&nbsp; Also noticed has been wider shelf spacing between products in particular grocery departments (health and beauty, cereal, hot dog cases).&nbsp; If you're willing to make the effort, check occasionally for empty space behind the front two rows of products, which might have been moved forward to the very front of the shelf to make it appear more well-stocked.&nbsp; This <em>Potemkin-Village</em> effect is a wonderful metaphor for what's become of the American economy as the media touts the stock market but the large majority of Americans grow poorer.&nbsp; But it was a recent article about the effects of deflation upon the grocery supply chain at <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-08-30/food-deflation-driving-least-profitable-year-20-years-farmers-and-grocers-get-crushe" title="zerohedge.com">zerohedge</a> that confirmed what I've noticed.&nbsp; As prices have collapsed, the entities at the various levels throughout the supply chain are scrambling to adjust and companies are either surviving or dying and it's the indications of this that are being exhibited subtly in the grocery aisles.</p>

 <title>A View From The Ridge, Part 8</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There have been moments in the life of this project when I've encountered what I now call <em><a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/26" title="PracticalDad:  A View From The Ridge">a view from the ridge</a></em>.&nbsp; These are instances in which you get a sense that you've emerged from the thickets of daily family life - appointments, events, stuff - and find yourself at a juncture where you can suddenly assess where you're at and where you're going.&nbsp; This late August  morning is such a time.&nbsp; When the first View note - linked above - was written seven years ago, Eldest was entering high school, Middle was entering his last year of elementary school and Youngest was finishing first grade and discovering a love for baseball.</p>
<p>This morning's instance was the awakening to the fact that Eldest is now officially out of the household.&nbsp; I awoke early and padded down the hallway, entering a closed door to a room that was now empty except for a single bed.&nbsp; All of the remaining furniture and clothing was gone, packed up and moved out several days previously.&nbsp; Such a process is slowly occurring in Middle's room, now in college; it's become clear that this past summer was his last at home as his own studies and professional development will require that he pursue opportunities in major urban areas.&nbsp; All of the furniture is still there, but that which gives it personality - that which makes you understand that it's <em>Middle's</em> room - is partially gone to his new college digs.&nbsp; Youngest's room is still clustered there with his siblings' rooms but he is now entering high school himself and gearing up for a Fall/Winter run at making the school baseball team, a far cry from the T-ball year when I started writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the other direction, the elder generation is finally settled after a lengthy period in which I sometimes wondered whether the sandwich in the term <em>sandwich generation</em> was actually a panini, hard pressed.&nbsp; There are still rough patches ahead as age and disease process continue, but a look backwards is revealing for the thicketed woods through which we've come.&nbsp;What hasn't changed through this is the presence of my Better Half, a person about whom I've largely been silent in the writings.&nbsp; BH is my companion and love, a person with gifts at which I still marvel and without whom the thickets would be far more difficult.&nbsp; And perhaps that's the one of the biggest surprises as I sit here mulling what to write...that as the kids grow and move out into the world, you again find the time and energy to rediscover that one person with whom you began to travel the road.&nbsp; Make the effort to step back from the day-to-day occasionally to apprise where you are and take stock of what you've come through, where you're going and most importantly, who you're with.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - August 2016</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>PracticalDad note:&nbsp; The process of writing in the past year has slowed appreciably and has actually come to a stop within the past three months.&nbsp; There are certainly still things to be written because the situations, observations and conversations with the kids have continued nonetheless, but the process of being <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/789" title="PracticalDad:  On Being Sandwiched">sandwiched</a> has risen to impressive levels.&nbsp; But it is beginning to resolve and my hope is that life will right itself enough that I can get back to this.&nbsp; That said, I at least managed to get the pricing for the Price Index done.</em></p>
<p>The prices for the August 2016 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index have been noted and the results calculated and they are, as they were in July, continuing to bounce around at the levels they were when the Index began in November 2010.&nbsp; The full marketbasket of 47 items actually rose over half a point in August to 100.19 from July's result of 99.51 (November 2010 = 100) while the 37 item foodstuff only Sub-Index rose almost three quarters of a basis point to 99.74 from July's result of 99.01 (again, November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; Certainly there are items that are more expensive than they were at the outset of the project almost six years ago, but enough items have been offset enough in prices to actually bring the average cost of the marketbasket back to a point at which it stood back in November of 2010.</p>
<p>What is notable about this month?&nbsp;</p>
<p><li>There is yet another product that is being dropped from the shelves by grocers because it apparently doesn't generate enough revenue to justify its continuance on the shelves.&nbsp; This store-brand item is still available at a single grocer but even that item was noted to have undergone stealth inflation as the container size dropped from 12.8 ounces to 12 ounces.</li></p>
<p><li>There continue to be instances in which the shelving is empty at different parts of the store.&nbsp; There were several instances this month in which the sampled items were absent from the shelves and it was only by locating the shelf label that I could verify whether or not it continued to be even offered.</li></p>
<p><li>There is yet another instance of stealth deflation as one of the grocers returned it's packaging to the original size.&nbsp; The cost is higher than it was with the smaller packaging, but on a per-ounce, price-adjusted basis, it is less expensive.</li></p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - July 2016:&nbsp; Confirming Deflation</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>It used to be that you could get a candy bar for a nickel.&nbsp; Then a year later, you could get three candy bars for a dime.&nbsp; A year after that, nobody had a dime.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>- explanatory comment about deflation by 'Dryfly' to the writer in the comment thread of <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com" title="Calculated Risk">Calculated Risk</a>, circa 2008</em></p>
<p>The prices for the PracticalDad Price Index grocery basket have been collected from the three separate and unrelated grocers and the results continue to confirm deflation and the failure of the Quantitative Easing programs to spark moderated inflation.&nbsp; The Total Index of the 47 item basket dropped again, this time to 99.51 from June's 99.90 (November 2010 = 100); the 37 Food-Only Sub-index (the 37 foodstuff items such as dairy, meats, etc) likewise dropped from June's 100.24 to this month's level of 99.01 (again, November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; The upshot?&nbsp; Although the aggregate cost of the full <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">basket</a> was actually less than at the project's outset in November, 2010, the aggregate cost of the 37 foodstuff items within the basket was still slightly higher.&nbsp; As of this month's result however, that Sub-index is now likewise lower than at the project's outset in November, 2010.&nbsp; So yes, hamburger will still cost more than almost six years ago, but there have been enough changes in other items to offset that and lower the aggregate cost.</p>
<p>You'd say that prices have actually decreased, which is seemingly a good thing.&nbsp; It's supposedly what we want, with prices stable or even a little lower so that we can get more for our dollar.&nbsp; But it really isn't all that it's cracked up to be and the opening comment from Dryfly - the <em>nom de blog</em> of an exceptionally astute individual - illustrates why.&nbsp; Prices for items can go up and down <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/669" title="PracticalDad:  Just What is Inflation Anyway?">for different reasons</a>, but the largest reason for the prices of everyday items to rise and fall is the aggregate amount of money coursing through the economy.&nbsp; When there is sufficient money flowing through, normally through family income, people are willing to spend and the price of a particular item is usually the point at which buyers and sellers agree that a sale should occur.&nbsp; <em>It used to be that you could get a candy bar for a nickel.</em>&nbsp; But if the underlying money supply begins to diminish, buyers become more cautious about how they spend their money and sellers have to work harder to persuade buyers to spend their money.&nbsp; <em>Then a year later, you could get three candy bars for a dime.</em>&nbsp; In a truly deflationary economy however, the money supply held by the public is so low that people simply have no money or refuse to spend what little they have and the sellers simply go out of business.&nbsp; <em>A year after that, nobody had a dime.</em>&nbsp; The unspoken phrase in this brief sentence is that there was nobody around to sell a candy bar, either.&nbsp; This was the Great Depression of 1929 in a nutshell and it's not for nothing that Ben Bernanke was selected to replace Alan Greenspan as chair of the Federal Reserve since Bernanke's theses had been about the then-Fed's errors in responding to the Depression.&nbsp; People lost their money and businesses lost control of prices as they engaged in bare-knuckle behavior in order to stay in business and more often than not, they went bankrupt.</p>
<p>So this new monthly Index level isn't as good of a thing as the Fed would like to see.&nbsp; It continues to illustrate the effect of the family's loss of income; for the average family, not only is their income less, but they are now forced to contend with competing demands for their income as other costs are off-loaded by corporations and the government onto their narrow shoulders.&nbsp; It also says something that despite the efforts of a central bank to inject <em>trillions</em> of dollars into the economy, so little has been accomplished for the family while so much has been accomplished for the <em>uber</em>-wealthy, the .01%.&nbsp; The grocers are taking multiple approaches to both maintain sales and keep things affordable for the consumer:</p>
<li>They are keeping meat prices within reach by starting to contract with <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/782" title="PracticalDad Price Index - January 2016:  Welcome to the Jungle">high volume meatpackers</a> who sell their products in <em>chubs</em>.</li>
<li>They are now including what economists refer to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_good" title="wikipedia/inferior goods">inferior goods</a>, i.e. items that are cheaper substitutes that wouldn't be purchased when incomes were more flush.&nbsp; When I began this project, the most affordable alternative on the store shelf was the generic store brand and the inferior good alternatives were available only at discount grocery stores where the majority of the population doesn't shop.&nbsp; But the grocers are now starting to introduce these labels into their own stores so that the store-brand products become the mid-line alternatives.</li>
<li>They have always paid attention to the profitability of items on their shelves but now instead of dropping individual brands, they are dropping entire products from any producer so that the consumer no longer has that option within that store.&nbsp; The logistics of the survey are that I visit the same three stores each month and price the 47 marketbasket items within each for a total of 141 items cumulatively.&nbsp; Already, I have to account for the fact that two of the three stores no longer even stock one of the original items and that particular item is now dependent solely upon the remaining store for inclusion; if that store were to drop the item, I would end the survey.&nbsp; This month, two separate grocers each discontinued carrying a single item and that leaves me with two more of the 141 now missing.&nbsp; I have given thought to discontinuing the project if it reaches a point that so many of the original items are missing that the validity is threatened but it's not enough of a factor yet that it's in the cards.&nbsp; Of course, if it does reach that point that too many of these common grocery items are missing from the store shelves, then it's moot because we're going to have far bigger fish to fry instead.</li>
<li>The grocers are decreasing their overall inventory and placing less on the shelves.&nbsp; I'd noticed in the past year that shelf spacing was becoming erratic and in the past several months have purposefully paid attention to the appearance of the shelves.&nbsp; What I've seen is that the grocers do seem to be increasing the empty space between products although I haven't gone in with a ruler to measure them.&nbsp; In the case of one grocer, there's an appreciable difference in the shelf area for non-food personal care items such as shampoos and in another, in the cereal aisle.</li>
<li>The grocers have periodically changed their package sizing to meet the situation.&nbsp; When the QE programs were in effect and commodity prices were rising, products underwent <em>stealth inflation</em> as prices remained the same yet the package sizing decreased so that the net effect was an increase in price for that item had the sizing remained the same.&nbsp; What I've begun to see is the reverse, <em>stealth deflation</em>, as the package sizing is actually increasing with either no change in price or only a moderate increase that reflects an actual price drop in the item.&nbsp; This has happened several times with store-brand coffee and most recently with the Suave Shampoo brand, which replaced the 22.5 ounce container with a 30 ounce bottle.&nbsp; In the case of the shampoo, the price changes have not been high enough and when the pricing is recalculated to the original size bottle, the effect is a per ounce price cut.</li>
<li>The grocers are also finding ways to mass their purchasing power and force concessions from the producers.&nbsp; The one grocer is owned by an international firm and I can see how they're exerting their buying power on the producers as they're simply cutting prices on more and more items.&nbsp; There is also the likelihood that they're driving things down purposefully in order to overwhelm and outlast their smaller competitors; yet the reality is that the prices on similar items are being cut in the other grocers as well.</li>
<p>The takeaway is this.&nbsp; These changes aren't occurring because the grocers and producers are being kind to stretched consumers.&nbsp; They're happening because the grocers have to find a way to maintain sales in a population in which the money increasingly just isn't there.&nbsp; And that is deflation.</p>
<p>And now for the past six months of results.&nbsp; <em>Note:&nbsp; There was an error in last month's table for the June results and I have corrected this in this table.&nbsp; The correct figures were reported in last month's text but the numbers were listed incorrectly in the table.&nbsp; This did not, however, alter the fact that the Total Index for June 2016 did breach the original index floor of 100 for that month.</em></p>

 <category>Family Management</category>
 <title>Inventory Management on the Other End</title>
 <content:encoded><p>It shouldn't be this way, but a fair part of being a parent is inventory management as you try to work through all of the stuff that comes into the home.&nbsp; You are fortunate if you have links to other families with growing kids and are able to save money by sharing hand-me-down clothing.&nbsp; It's a great thing but the down side is that you can't control when it arrives and so you suddenly find yourself working through one or more bags to ascertain what might work.&nbsp; This process also involves corralling a resistant child who would rather have a tooth extracted than try on clothing.&nbsp; <em>Dad, it fits, it fits already!</em> kvetches the youngster as he edges towards the door in the hope of escape.&nbsp; But the process slows as the kids grow and reach their expected height and sense of style and the push to manage the inventory diminishes.&nbsp; There does come a time in middle age however, when the necessity to manage the inventory again grows and you find yourself handling boxes, bags and paperwork except that this time it's on the other end of the age spectrum.</p>
<p>So precisely what do I mean by the other end?&nbsp; If you have kids when you're younger, the other end will be the kids as they come and go to college and you suddenly find the living room or garage again full of boxes and bags brought home from school for the summer as they have to vacate dorm rooms and campus apartments.&nbsp; You turn around and <em>Wham!</em>, you've got a raft of  debris filling the family space.&nbsp; If you've had kids when you're older, then the other end will consist not only of the kids returning but also the elders who are liable to be looking to lighten their own load.&nbsp; About two years ago, my mother-in-law - actually a wonderful woman - showed up to visit and handed me a box of old tupperware containers with the comment <em>This makes me happy, so just say thank you.</em>&nbsp; The saving grace in this little episode is that it was a ripple on the shore compared to the tsunami that arrived years ago when two elderly relatives on both sides of our family entered retirement facilities in the same summer, an event from which my garage has never fully recovered and has led to the requisite rental of a storage unit.&nbsp; That summer's nadir was the arrival of a one-horse plow fished at the last minute from the suburban backyard shed of an elderly grandmother, who had kept it out of a sentimental attachment to her North Carolinian farmer-father.&nbsp; That it wound up at our house was a testament to the amount of items and the rapidity with which they had to be disposed.&nbsp; My wife's thought was <em>just bring it north and we'll figure out what to do with it.</em></p>
<p>Why go to the effort of trying to sort and manage it instead of just tossing it into a dumpster?&nbsp; First, there is actually an emotional component to some of the items.&nbsp; I began writing this article in my spare time three nights ago and last night, Eldest - now a college graduate - inquired about a half-completed quilt begun for her many years ago by her now-deceased great-grandmother.&nbsp; It is presently wrapped and stored in our basement and I suspect that she'll pull it and complete it herself.&nbsp; But the other reality is that there are also heirloom and economic issues as well.&nbsp; Our own children will become adults and anything that we can do to help get them established - and providing them with quality furniture checks off that box - is worth the effort.&nbsp; They might not appreciate an heirloom solid cherry desk or bedroom suite now, but I expect that they will when they're older and don't have to fork over money for knock-off imported crap.&nbsp; It's not for nothing that we took in a 75 year old single owner Baldwin baby grand piano from a deceased family friend; Middle already loves the instrument and we've all agreed, even his siblings, that it will someday go to him when he is capable of taking it.&nbsp; What that means for us is that we've had to rent a storage unit and take care of what and how we place furniture there in order to maintain it and prevent its ruin.&nbsp; It also means an on-going review and debate of what we can and need to keep as we move forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some of my criteria?</p>
<li>First, is there a story or something truly personal about it?&nbsp; A hand-made wool Navaho blanket given as a wedding gift to my parents more than six decades ago...<em>stays</em>.&nbsp; A half-completed quilt for a great-grandchild...<em>stays</em>.&nbsp; A stack of blankets/towels/linens from Target...<em>gone.</em></li>
<li>Is the item one that will actually have a perceptible use or value to myself or one of the kids within the next <em>X</em> number of years?&nbsp; Toolbox full of old shipbuilding tools?&nbsp; <em>Gone.</em>&nbsp; Excellent condition baby grand piano?&nbsp; <em>Stays.</em></li>
<li>Is it better shared elsewhere if there's historical or collectible value yet space is an issue?&nbsp; Maybe that vintage Wehrmacht microscope with Zeiss optics and signed factory inspection papers is better served at a museum than in my attic (actually happened here).</li>
<li>In the alternative, can I better use the money from selling or donating it?</li>
<li>Can I properly store the item without causing it damage and would proper storage be cost-prohibitive?</li>
<li>Does my better half likewise agree with the decision?&nbsp; If not, then it's probably best to just suck it up and manage until the situation resolves itself either via change of circumstance or mind.</li>
<p>If you sit back and consider them, you're likely to find that there are other decision criteria than what's just listed above.&nbsp; But the important thing is to understand that the time is likely to come when you're going to be involved in helping to manage the inventory of elderly friends and relatives.&nbsp; When it does, determine your criteria and then hew to it as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Just what did happen to the horse-drawn hand plow?&nbsp; After a few weeks sitting in the garage as we worked through the other items, my wife suggested that I contact a local state historical museum that specialized in early American agriculture and I did so, leaving multiple messages over several weeks with the director and receiving no response.&nbsp; Several weeks after the last phone call, the plow went to the curb to the curiosity of neighbors and garbagemen.&nbsp; Two weeks after that, the museum director called me back.</p>
<p>But at least the plow was out of my garage.</p>

 <content:encoded><p>The PracticalDad Price Index for June 2016 is completed and calculated and the results are simple.&nbsp; The Total Index of <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">a market basket consisting of 47 grocery store items</a> again lost ground from the previous month and <em>broke the buck</em>, actually declining to a level below its initial start point in November 2010.&nbsp; The June 2016 Total Index declined to 99.90 (November 2010 = 100) from May's near-zero reading of 100.66.&nbsp; The Food-Only Sub-index of 37 foodstuff items within the same marketbasket likewise lost ground from May's level of 101.60 to this June's reading of 100.24 (November 2010 = 100).</p>
<p>What precisely does that mean?&nbsp; Simple:&nbsp; It now officially costs less to buy the market basket of 47 grocery items than it did at the beginning of the survey in November 2010.&nbsp; So much for Quantitative Easing.</p>
<p>What does it mean to <em>break the buck</em>?&nbsp; The term comes from the money market group of mutual funds and refers to the scenario that all money market managers try desperately to avoid - when the Net Asset Value of their fund's actual investments decreases below the $1 per share floor.&nbsp; Understand that money market funds are considered to be the safest investments around since they invest their proceeds in extremely short term debt instruments, which are of such short duration that they are considered ultra-safe.&nbsp; But while safe, money market funds aren't insured by the FDIC so the managers work assiduously to ensure that their share Net Asset Values don't <em>break the buck</em> and breach the $1 floor, an event with signficant psychological impact upon the fund-holders.&nbsp; The last time that a fund did so was in 2008, at the height of the financial crisis and the government actually created a fund to insure and stabilize that market.&nbsp; As I sat and reviewed the results, it seemed to be an appropriate term that's applicable to situation.&nbsp; The Fed's intent with the multiple Quantitative Easing Programs was to invoke inflationary pressures and so long as they could inject liquidity into the system, it managed to create a modicum of steam to drive inflation.&nbsp; But the ending of QE 3 in late October of 2014 doused the boilers and brought a deflationary return that commenced within only two months and has continued almost continuously since then.&nbsp; What it took the Fed to accomplish in 49 months - with some help from real supply/demand issues in beef and dairy - has been simply reversed back to, and beyond, the original point in only 18 months.&nbsp; The Fed must indeed feel like that 2008 Fund manager as they too, break the buck to a point where they don't wish to be.</p>
<p>And now for the past six months of results.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - May 2016:&nbsp; Start Watching the Shelves</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Deflation reigns.</p>
<p>The May installment of the PracticalDad Price Index is now ready, prices for the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">47 item marketbasket</a> gathered at three unrelated grocers, averaged and calculated.&nbsp; The result?&nbsp; Deflation continues as the Total Index dropped from April's level of 101.64 to a current level in May 2016 of 100.66 (November 2010 = 100), a decrease of almost a full basis point.&nbsp; When I remove the ten non-food items, the remaining 37 item Food-Only Index did increase marginally from April's 101.40 to May's 101.60 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; This month's Total Index drop was fueled by one grocer's decision to drop the cost of a package of Enfamil formula and another's decision to significantly drop the price of both adult and children's store-brand ibuprofen.&nbsp; Magnify these types of decisions by the untold number of prices that are on the shelves of grocers across the United States and you have a sense of what's occurring.</p>
<p>There is another significant difference this month and that pertains to what I've noticed as to the inventory levels maintained by the grocers.&nbsp; There have been occasional blurbs noted online - and I can't verify where I've read them - about what might be going on with the inventory levels at retailers as people might have noticed that clothing racks suddenly appear to be more widely spaced apart than they might have been in a previous visit several months before.&nbsp; Because the PracticalDad Price Index is a monitor of grocery <em>prices</em> instead of inventory levels, I haven't paid explicit attention to what's happening with the product inventory.&nbsp; It's something that I've begun to notice within the past years in a <em>huh...</em> fashion as shelves might appear to have fewer of the item in stock than previously or even missing it completely, leaving me to work with the shelving label.&nbsp; But I was taken aback this month to see entire gaps in the frozen food section of one grocer as multiple products were missing in entirety from the case - and the shelves were still labelled for those products.&nbsp; This observation raised a mental concern and that concern was confirmed when I visited another grocer to find a perceptible difference in the quantity of products on the shelves of the health/beauty aisle.&nbsp; In this particular store, there was the typical variety of health/beauty products for sale but in far less quantity than I ever recalled seeing previously; there would be handful of an item but it would be set back against the back of the shelf and the front part of the shelf would be completely empty.&nbsp; Magnify this across an entire spectrum of products in the health/beauty section and it appeared utterly barren.&nbsp; When I continued through that particular store, I began to note other areas in which the product line appeared to be well-stocked but only because the amount on the shelves had been moved forward but there was very little behind it.&nbsp; In other words, there was no product in depth on the shelving as I'd seen in previous months or years.</p>
<p>So what is the upshot?&nbsp; As family incomes continue to decline and the middle-class American is stretched, this economic emaciation is beginning to move through the greater economy as grocers now appear to be far more actively culling their inventory levels to maintain their margins and profitability.&nbsp; I've already noted that a grocer might opt to no longer carry a product because it simply isn't profitable - two of the three grocers no longer carry cases of size 3 store-brand diapers, for example - but this is now moving beyond the individual product choice to a broader spectrum.&nbsp; So when you next walk through the aisles, looking at the shelves and have a <em>huh...</em> moment, there's a decent chance that it isn't just you.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>A View From The Ridge, Part 7</title>
 <content:encoded><p>I've <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/758" title="PracticalDad.com/A View From the Ridge">said before</a> that being an engaged father is akin to hiking a heavily forested area.&nbsp; The life with kids and their activities is a forest for the trees experience as the rush from one place to the next fills your vision and planner and you don't always have the opportunity to take a moment to reflect.&nbsp; But then your wooded trail comes to a ridgeline and you can suddenly see for miles, backwards to where you've been as well as forward to what lies ahead and you sit for a moment and take it all in.&nbsp; Such was the case this weekend as Eldest - who was in middle school when I first thought of this site - graduated from college.</p>
<p>The benefit of arriving early to grab seats for elderly relatives was that I could look in different directions from the ridgeline.&nbsp; When I looked in one direction, considering the event in terms of this website, Eldest had progressed from middle-schooler to college graduate.&nbsp; Middle, the elementary school kid at the site's inception, had arrived the previous day with his grandparents, who picked him up at a nearby train station where he'd caught a morning train from the city where he himself is now in college.&nbsp; Youngest, at the outset just entering kindergarten, was now himself in middle school and en route to becoming a truly stalwart adult of honestly surprising capabilities of observation and common sense.&nbsp; When the doors finally opened and I found seats that worked, my Better Half ushered in her parents and the sons followed with Boyfriend, who had come along unannounced to surprise Eldest.</p>
<p>In another direction from the ridge was to see things in terms of the college experience and while one was now graduating college, the youngest was still a good two years away from beginning the pathway to higher education; it will probably be a college degree given his growing skill set and inclination, but the reality is that the cost of a degree is such that it can no longer be the <em>de facto</em> choice, the road taken simply because it's what everybody is expected to do when high school is finished.&nbsp; My wife and I have now lived through two rounds of college solicitations - and folks, it's fascinating to see how different the college mailings are from one kid to the next - and prospect visits, completion of the dreaded <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/534" title="PracticalDad:  Critiquing the FAFSA">FAFSA</a> and the excitement of the acceptances and first moves away from home.&nbsp; What also crossed my mind was that the funding of college was now a family affair.&nbsp; This was, for Eldest, a communal family effort as her debt-free degree was in due to multiple parts:  a decent scholarship that made the difference between this particular university and a local state university; four years of hard work through summer jobs to help pay for her annual contribution to the cause; years of savings and then input into the pot by us; and a lovely piece of generosity from another elderly relative.</p>
<p>In another direction was the view of my own age and mortality.&nbsp; It's now more than two decades since Eldest's birth and as she has aged, so have I.&nbsp; Some years ago, a now-deceased elderly friend commented to me that in his head, he was the same guy who once served as a Marine and a firefighter and I have come to appreciate his statement.&nbsp; All three of the kids have grown up knowing that their father has a <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/199" title="PracticalDad:  &quot;Dad, Are You a Cripple?&quot;">physical debility</a> and each has adapted to it through the years.&nbsp; But it's fallen most upon Youngest to help pick up the slack caused by the issue and his siblings' college absence.&nbsp; It's a most curious coincidence that he is now the largest and strongest of any of us within the household, most capable of picking up and covering for said slack and I go to lengths to avoid abusing him because of it.&nbsp; I have to admit that there was conflict between personal pride and common sense during the wait, as I considered a lengthy drive behind the wheel of a 16' box truck with no cruise control and it was only after acknowledging to myself that I'm no longer a thirty-something young father, that I agreed to let someone else handle that aspect of the move.&nbsp; I plan to be around for Youngest's event in less than a decade but there's a point at which you realize that it's time to adjust the speed downwards and go for distance instead of speed.</p>
<p>But doors open, crowds enter and the view fades and you are once again in the forest amidst the trees, waiting for that next moment when you reach the ridge.&nbsp; Maybe I should make it a point to try for the ridgeline more often.</p></content:encoded>

 <category>Family / Personal Economics</category>
 <title>Post-Consumer Parenting</title>
 <content:encoded><p>We have many jobs and roles as parents, too many to note.&nbsp; But all of these things happen to only one purpose - to raise the kids to make their way in the adult world; successfully, we hope.&nbsp; Much of their success will be dependent upon their own efforts but it's the simple truth that their efforts will be built upon the foundation that we give them.&nbsp; If it's crucial that we teach them about the great, wide world then we have to understand that the world in which we were ourselves raised has changed and that particularly goes to our economic system.&nbsp; We must now purposefully buck the long-prevailing consumer-model - in which the lion's share of American economic activity is predicated upon the typical American's willingness to spend - as that is functionally dead.&nbsp; We have to now raise our kids to both survive and live within a <em>post-consumer</em> system.</p>
<p><em>Post-consumer</em> is a term typically tied to ecology and sustainability.&nbsp; We see the term posted on the park benches made from recycled plastic products and on cereal boxes touting that they've been made from 30% recycled paper and cardboard materials.&nbsp; It has come about because of the earth-friendly ecology movement that launched in the latter part of the twentieth century and the whole movement has a new-age, California, touchy-feely vibe to it.&nbsp; Yet <em>post-consumer</em> also has a much more hard-nosed aspect to it that is intimately tied to what we're seeing in both America and the world around us.&nbsp; Remember that the words <em>ecology</em> and <em>economics</em> are at their heart related to the same thing, albeit from different angles.&nbsp; Each is based upon the prefix <em>eco-</em>, <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eco-" title="derived ultimately from the greek oikos-, meaning household or habitat">derived ultimately from the greek <em>oikos-</em>, meaning household or habitat</a>.</p>
<p>Ecology literally translates as the study (<em>-ology</em>) of our household or habitat but became synonymous with the environment in the wake of a series of widely covered environmental disasters such as the infamous incident in which an Ohio river, the Cuyahoga, caught fire in the late 1960s.&nbsp; It was inconceivable to even the most common person that water could be so utterly polluted and fouled that it lost the most basic property of being able to extinguish burning debris floating upon it.&nbsp; Coupled with a multitude of images of dead and befouled wildlife and adopted as a cause by the then-young and hip Boomer generation and it took on today's evocation.&nbsp; Economy is a word likewise coupled with the root of household and habitat but from a different aspect, that of how it is numbered (<em>-nomics</em>).&nbsp; Step back from the hard-math financial aspects promoted by many economists, economics is at its heart a matter of how our resources are not only numbered but allocated and - <em>boy howdy!</em> - are we looking at the America of today.&nbsp; Wealth gap, anyone?</p>
<p>Ours is at least the third generation to be raised under the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/638" title="PracticalDad:  CIGXM">consumer-driven model of the economy.</a>&nbsp; This model conceives of the average American - the consumer - as a driver for economic growth and was first proposed by macro-economists in the early twentieth century but didn't become an economic reality until it was pushed in the years immediately following the Second World War.&nbsp; The principal economic driver beforehand had been Business and Capital Investment but its collapse in the Great Depression meant that American political and economic leaders began to look elsewhere for a driver to supplement that if not outright replace it.&nbsp; What made the consumer-model possible was more than just the growth of personal income via well-paying jobs; it was also that many costs previously borne by the individual were now partially borne by other sectors of the economy.&nbsp; Insurance for health-care costs was becoming a standard benefit for corporations that hired many Americans.&nbsp; Educational costs for the youngsters was subsidized by the state first via the GI Bill of 1944 and then subsequently through public funding of state supported colleges and universities.&nbsp; Old age was no longer feared economically as there were corporate and public-sector pensions and the government now guaranteed a base minimum via Social Security.&nbsp; There was now not only income, but <em>disposable</em> income that allowed for the things - the niceties - that were previously unaffordable to previous generations.&nbsp; The wants that we've now been ably taught to accept as needs.</p>
<p>The truth is that the consumer-driven model is now functionally dead, an economic zombie shambling along and awaiting the merciful head shot that drops it, allowing it to be kicked into the gutter and out of the way.&nbsp; The very factors that made it possible are either falling away as we watch or gone completely.&nbsp; We've now seen almost an entire decade of falling family incomes and the wealth gap is increasing to levels unseen since the Gilded Age of the late 19th century.&nbsp; Health insurance?&nbsp; Increasingly unaffordable and shifted back to the family and individual.&nbsp; Educational costs?&nbsp; Disproportionately expensive and with public funding cut back, costs borne more and more by the family and youth.&nbsp; Retirement?&nbsp; Likewise shifted back to the individual with an increasing reliance upon self-funding via the IRA/401k.&nbsp; The <em>you can have it all</em> mantra with which we were incubated in the consumer-model system is now replaced by a painful and simple reality.&nbsp; <em>You can't.</em></p> 
<p>This sea-change is the truth with which we have to contend and which we will have to teach our children.&nbsp; It is not, however, a truth that the economic and political establishment wishes to acknowledge.&nbsp; Establishment mouthpieces such as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> print missives to the American public telling them that they <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/02/grand-central-a-letter-to-stingy-american-consumers/" title="blogs.wsj.com">aren't doing their part as consumers.</a>&nbsp; Economists at the Federal Reserve publish studies about Americans not spending and slant their  phrasing phrasing negatively when they state that Americans are <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/On-The-Economy/2014/September/What-Does-Money-Velocity-Tell-Us-about-Low-Inflation-in-the-US" title="hoarding money"><em>hoarding</em> money</a>.&nbsp; When former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke spoke to a group of high school educators, <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/696" title="PracticalDad:  The Fed and My Family">his choice of terminology was telling</a>.&nbsp; When he referenced teens, he referred to them as <em>students</em> and <em>young people</em>; when he referenced adults however, he predominantly used the term <em>consumer</em> with the implication that our job is to raise our young people to be consumers.&nbsp; In the days immediately following the 9/11 attacks, then-President George W. Bush even spoke to the American people and urged that they shouldn't let the terrorists win but should instead go back out and shop.&nbsp; Seriously...<em>shop?</em>&nbsp; So obviously, spending money matters.&nbsp; Questioning the consumer model is a threat to the corporate profits that are directed to a smaller and smaller cadre of executives and investors that make up the high tier of the wealthy class.&nbsp; Questioning this model is a threat to the profitable tenure and security of our elected and government officials, many of whom will exit government to cushy sinecures in the private sector.&nbsp; Acknowledging this will require the public will for change that is a threat to the cancerous symbiosis between the corporate and political sectors that is, at its heart, <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15637" title="U Cal Santa Barbara:  The Presidency Project">fascism</a>.</p>
<p>The rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders as presidential contenders is a clear sign of the public pushback.&nbsp; There are commonalities at the core of each movement that ultimately lead back to renewed opportunity for the individual and most importantly, sustainable, living-wage jobs.&nbsp; There are massive differences in how each candidate would hope to achieve these ends but when you cut through them, the heart of each pertains ultimately to trade, jobs and income.</p>
<p>This consumer-driven economic model that we've followed has been around for longer than the lifespan of most Americans and like anything, it will change and be replaced by something else.&nbsp; That is at the heart of our present upset because nobody knows with what it should be replaced and such a real-life process is neither as sterile nor academic as it would seem when written on a page.&nbsp; What the Establishment seems to want is a perpetuation of the model even though they understand that it continues the hemorrhage of the American Middle-Class until the. masses of our countrymen are reduced to a servitude of dead-end jobs and interest payments.&nbsp; It's what they know and as the saying goes, <em>if you give a monkey a hammer, then that's what it's going to use.</em>&nbsp; However, that doesn't square with the great mass of Americans who understand that something is badly amiss yet can't precisely enunciate what it is.</p>
<p>So here are the takeaways.</p>
<p>First, the Consumer-Model economic driver of the past six-plus decades is officially dead.&nbsp; It has been killed by a combination of falling incomes on one side and competing demands for that same income on the other side.</p>
<p>Second, the Corporate/Political Establishment has a vested interest in perpetuating this dead model.&nbsp; The Corporate because it allows money to be extracted from someone else - the Consumer - and redirected to them.&nbsp; The Political because of unchecked campaign finance practices and a post-political career revolving door into the lucrative corporate sector.</p>
<p>Third, we cannot assume that whatever replaces the consumer model is already pre-ordained.&nbsp; What we are witnessing with the utterly unexpected rise of Trump and Sanders are early salvos in a contest between this Establishment and the diverse citizenry.&nbsp; If the Gilded Age is any example, it will be a contest that will last for decades.&nbsp; That means that we have to remove our noses from Facebook pages and begin to think in the longer term.</p>
<p>Fourth, parents must begin to purposefully raise their children so that they aren't herded into a dead economic system that views them solely as prey.&nbsp; We must be overt and direct in our conversations with them and we must likewise model an economic behavior of controlled consumption that is, for many of us, uncomfortably new.</p>
<p>We must become the first generation of Post-Consumer Parents.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - April 2016:&nbsp; The Failure of QE</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Frequently, compiling the monthly PracticalDad Price Index is less than exciting - have you ever wondered how stupid you must look when you're on your knees checking a shelf label six inches from the floor? - and the results can be dull.&nbsp; But there are times when it is exciting, and the past number of months are a case in point.&nbsp; Last evening's final calculation for April led to an audible <em>sonuvabitch</em> as I considered the number on the spreadsheet.&nbsp; The Total Index result for the 47 item marketbasket dropped by more than a full basis point to an April level of 101.64 while the 37 foodstuff item Food-Only Sub-index declined by almost one and a half basis points to an April level of 101.40.&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; It means that everything that the Federal Reserve has tried to achieve with three rounds of Quantitative Easing, the trillions of dollars added to the money supply and their own balance sheet in an effort to spur inflation, is being utterly wiped away in abject failure.&nbsp; Unless, of course, you're a hedge fund manager with assets in the market.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The 47 item grocery marketbasket index began in November 2010 with a baseline index of 100 and through QE programs <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quantitative-easing-2-qe2.asp" title="investopedia.com">2</a> and <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/quantitative-easing.asp" title="investopedia.com">3</a>, the programs were able to induce a degree of mild inflation to offset the dread deflation.&nbsp; But QE 3 ended at the end of October, 2014 and the 37 item foodstuff sub-index subsequently peaked in December, 2014 - only a month later - with a sub-index reading of 115.13 (again, November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; To purchase the same 37 foodstuff items more than four years after the outset of the Index would have cost 15.33% more at the peak.&nbsp; And now?&nbsp; Less than a year and a half later, with no QE, that has been almost wiped away and the indices are once again back where they were in the first quarter of 2011, only months after the start of QE 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note of one particular element of the data listed below.&nbsp; The final column is labelled <em>Spread</em> and is literally the differential between the Total Index and Food-Only Subindex results.&nbsp; For me, it's an indication of where the activity within the marketbasket is taking place, whether the 37 foodstuff items alone (for a breakdown of the items surveyed, see <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index - November 2010">here</a>) or whether there's more effect among the ten non-foodstuff items such as soap, ibuprofen or trash bags.&nbsp; What I've come to find is that the foodstuff segment of the Index is more sensitive to factors than the more stable 10 item non-foodstuff segment.&nbsp; Most of the rise in the Index has been fed by this more sensitive foodstuff segment and during the last months of the QE 3 program, the spread between the two was at times greater than three basis points with the Food-Only Subindex leading.&nbsp; But this month is only the third time in more than 65 months of consistent pricing that the Subindex trails; food led the way as an inflationary indicator and now it leads the way as a deflationary indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It shouldn't have been a surprise since the first part of the week brought a mailer from one of the surveyed supermarkets, which touted <em>Thousands More Prices Just Dropped</em>.&nbsp; This market, along with the two surveyed competitors, have taken multiple steps in the past year to adjust to the economic environment of increased food stamp usage and diminished family incomes.&nbsp; New suppliers have been found for their store brand offerings and cut-rate products are now sitting on the shelves for the price-conscious.&nbsp; Yes, meat is still higher than it was at the outset years ago, but that kind of supply/demand imbalance brought about by decades-low herd sizes doesn't end even remotely overnight.&nbsp; It can be mitigated by factory techniques brought to the meatpacking industry and this is happening as more stores are now selling their 80% lean ground in factory-packed plastic tubes called <em>chubs</em>.&nbsp; Yes, more temporary supply dislocations brought about by factors such as avian flu can arise, but these resolve more quickly and the products, especially eggs, are lower in price than they were.&nbsp; Yes, commodities such as sugar and coffee have suffered stealth inflation so that they're now sold in smaller containers, but even their prices have ebbed from their previous highs as the <em>hot money</em> of QE has ended.&nbsp; But the problem of the diminished family income, further weighted by new claims upon it by higher education and healthcare costs, isn't so easily treated.&nbsp; So the grocers do everything within their power to make their products more affordable so that they can compete and this bareknuckle price competition is symptomatic of deflation...brought about by a smaller money supply amongst the general public.</p>
<p>Which is perversely fascinating given all of the money that's been created by the Federal Reserve since the initial Quantitative Easing attempt began more than seven years ago.</p>
<p>This little datapoint of the prices at three unrelated grocery stores is fully related to the much larger issues being revealed by the chaos of the 2016 Presidential Electoral Process.&nbsp; Massive amounts of money have been created out of whole cloth yet so little is reaching the general public that true deflation is being exhibited by the pricing and production behaviors of the grocers, as close to the first line of consumer spending as any line of business on the planet.&nbsp; It's this political anger, fueled by unpopular trade policies and protracted military engagements that remove living-wage jobs and detract from important public investment, that gives literal rise to the figurative middle fingers of both left and right of the political spectrum to the establishment mandarins.&nbsp; Make no mistake about it, the anger from both sides is coming together as the divides are <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/514" title="Occupy/Tea Party:  Two Sides, Same Coin">two sides of the same coin</a> with the common element of anger directed at this government/corporate beast that we've allowed to be created.</p>
<p>So what happens to the prices going forward?&nbsp; While my guess is as good as anyone else's, the bet is that they'll continue to decline.&nbsp; Some items are more expensive than they were five and a half years ago, but there will be enough offset elsewhere that the cost of purchasing a marketbasket of the same items will actually be cheaper than they were at the outset.&nbsp; Unless they either re-institute another round of QE - which would be disastrous without fundamental changes to the existing system that's already created such divisions of wealth and class - or find a way to promote the creation of sustainable, living wage jobs, then the hemorrhaging and deflation will continue.&nbsp; So, here are the indices for the past six months.</p>

 <title>Kids, Socialism and the Communist Manifesto (Really&#8230;)</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The conversation occurred one evening when Middle was home from college on break.&nbsp; Given the political primaries occurring shortly, it naturally pertained to politics and where we stood on the issues.&nbsp; But as the time passed, the discussion widened from specific issues and candidates to one of more general political leanings and it was here that I learned that Middle was now classifying himself as a Democratic Socialist cut from the European mold.&nbsp; He likewise noted that many of his peers and friends now were leaning in that general direction and it was certainly in sync with the recent article that </content:encoded>

 <title>Driving Up the Cost of Higher Ed:&nbsp; Bette and the New Educational Baseline</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>Before he departed for his freshman year in college, Middle and I were talking about student debt and the high cost of a college degree.&nbsp; He looked at me and asked <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/783" title="PracticalDad.com">"How in the hell did this happen?"</a>&nbsp; This article is the third in a series that tries to make sense of what in the hell <bold>did</bold> happen to so disproportionately ratchet up the costs of higher education.</em></p>
<p>The cost of a degree didn't just skyrocket willy-nilly over the course of decades, much as the shuttle <em>Challenger</em> didn't just explode and the <em>Titanic</em> didn't just sink.&nbsp; In each instance, there were a variety of reasons that came together to set the stage for the events in question by guaranteeing that higher education now had a far more massive demand for its services than ever existed previously in American history.&nbsp; In terms of the demand for higher education, the first factor was <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/784" title="globalization and the knowledge-based economy">globalization and the knowledge-based economy</a>.&nbsp; The theory was that the lower-end and unpleasant manufacturing would be farmed out overseas and the Americans would, in their wisdom and foresight (and for those with Asperger's, this is sarcasm), keep the higher-end technical manufacturing, administrative and service functions here.&nbsp;  The second factor - and the one that we'll explore here - is also business-related:&nbsp; starting in the 1970s and afterwards, the business community shifted the educational baseline for employment from the high school diploma to the college degree.</p>
<p>A reasonable part of the shift during the last quarter of the twentieth century was objective.&nbsp; The baseline for academic performance - rightly or wrongly - is the SAT and since the the Golden Era of the 1960s, the average SAT scores <a href="http://www.erikthered.com/tutor/historical-average-SAT-scores.pdf" title="on both the verbal and math components had dropped consistently.">on both the verbal and math components had dropped consistently.</a>&nbsp;  There was also continuing criticism of the public school system and its apparent inability to prepare young people to compete in the workplace.&nbsp; No, folks, what we discuss today has been around in one form or another for decades.&nbsp; American business through the 1970s and 1980s was in the process of having its lunch eaten by the Japanese and Germans and entire industries were simply being destroyed.&nbsp; Remember the textile industry?&nbsp; Foreign competition was hungrier and the sense was that the former Axis powers had lost the Second World War but were well into the process of winning the peace.&nbsp; Given these factors, the push was on in the business world to recruit more and more college graduates to work instead of those with potentially suspect high school diplomas.&nbsp; <em>Hey, our high schoolers might be idiots but the good ones go through the still-respected college system and are ready to roll in the workforce</em> was the attitude.&nbsp; If you are old enough to recall the stories about Ford Pintos catching fire and Chrysler employees sending cars out the factory doors with empty bottles rattling around inside the car doors, it actually made sense.&nbsp; This gave the kids another four years to mature and gain a better education in preparation for the world.</p>
<p>But increasing global competitiveness wasn't the only reason that businesses shifted their baselines upwards.&nbsp; The other reason was simply a question of cosmetics and I was privileged to be intimately acquainted with two separate instances of cosmetic baseline changes.&nbsp; The first instance was cosmetic in terms of appearance to other businesses.&nbsp; My first real job was when an employer hired me as part of its first group of college-educated "professional" hires for a particular operational area.&nbsp; It was the job that actually paid me enough money to allow myself to move out of the family household, where I'd lived for a year after my own college graduation and it pertained to <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reinsurance-ceded.asp" title="investopedia.com">ceded reinsurance</a>.&nbsp; You can certainly refer back to the link, but the best real-world example is that of a bookie laying off bets with other bookies so that he isn't wiped out should that million-to-one shot actually pay off.&nbsp; Many insurance policies were written with reinsurance provisions that allowed a company with a large loss to be reimbursed by other companies and it was my job, along with the others, to review all of these losses and first ascertain if a reinsurance provision existed, then determine the amount to be billed and finally to get the money back from them.&nbsp; It is an arcane, technical arena of insurance and the hubs for such work are all in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Munich, Atlanta and London.&nbsp; My hire came about because the operations director for my new employer had looked around and noticed that everyone with whom his department interacted to retrieve the monies had, at the minimum, a bachelor's degree and in his mind, they'd be more willing to pay if they had faith in the competence of the people doing the billing.&nbsp; It made sense cosmetically.&nbsp; But the reality was that with adequate training, the job didn't actually require a college degree as much as the capacity to focus and a simple willingness to learn and this was something that the majority of the existing non-college staff had in abundance.&nbsp; We new hires did have to undergo two full weeks of classroom training before the director even allowed us onto the floor to shadow our non-degreed trainers and to say that it was uncomfortable was an understatement.&nbsp; The demand for a degree was further fueled when these same staffers were told that if they wanted to go anywhere else within the company at or above their pay-grade, they would now require a college degree.</p>
<p>The second instance of a cosmetic baseline change was to demonstrate perceived competence to prospective customers, even if the job again didn't require a college degree.&nbsp; <em>Hey, we're better!&nbsp; Our people have college degrees!</em>&nbsp; I left the reinsurance position to move to a smaller city where my better half was in school.&nbsp; There was no hope of another reinsurance job but I managed to swing another hire as a commercial claims adjuster for a regional insurance carrier.&nbsp; It is a mystery greater than the disappearance of Amelia Earhart that the claims manager and supervisor actually hired me since I had no actual experience doing this and simply had to learn on the spot, absorbing information and settling claims across a spectrum of insurance lines - workers' compensation, commercial and auto liability.&nbsp; But it was also another uncomfortable situation since that company had instituted a college-degree requirement for all claims adjusters.&nbsp; That meant that any future hires into adjusting positions had to be college graduates and that any future promotion for an adjuster was predicated upon the completion of a degree; another increase in the aggregate demand for a degree.&nbsp; Because I didn't receive the home office training received by new hires with a degree, I was literally dependent upon the goodwill of those around me, most especially those non-degreed adjusters now locked into a position.&nbsp; When one of these adjusters - Bette - asked me to help clarify her purported confusion about a liability case, I agreed to do so and then smuggled the file out of the office to study it that evening to find the appropriate response.&nbsp; When I gave her my response the following morning, I passed her test.</p>
<p>Bette was the perfect microcosm for the debate on whether a degree was truly necessary.&nbsp; A claims adjuster is the person who proverbially walks behind cleaning up after the elephant parade; the adjuster is dealing with those who have had a loss and it's not uncommon to take undeserved heat arising from misplaced anger.&nbsp; The questions that arise also beg answers that don't come from calculators:&nbsp; <em>How do you compensate someone for damage to an arm or leg?&nbsp; Does a person who is considered ugly deserve less for a scar than someone who isn't considered ugly?&nbsp; How much does someone deserve for pain and suffering?</em>&nbsp; It was Bette's handling of a particular case that taught me a life lesson in assessing value, detail and negotiation.&nbsp; Our insured store's security had publicly and wrongly detained an African-American educator in a neighborhood store for alleged shoplifting, immediately afterwards releasing him when the manager realized his innocence.&nbsp; A claim was filed for wrongful detention and the insured wanted to see it negotiated promptly so as to avoid a publicly humiliating trial.&nbsp; The case was assigned to Bette and she visited the educator and his wife, departing their home with the skeleton of what became a mutually satisfactory settlement after only the first visit.&nbsp; What she noticed on the visit was a variety of travel magazines on the coffee and end tables and she used that as a departure point for cordial conversation.&nbsp; After they began to discuss their claim, it became the segue to a settlement when she tied a potential amount to the cost of a vacation in their dream locale.&nbsp; The upshot was that the couple happily had a two week vacation for considerably less than a possible jury verdict.&nbsp; This case demonstrated more than anything that the college degree was utterly irrelevant to performance of the job at hand.&nbsp; There was nothing about 120 credits of academia that could have successfully concluded this case, or almost any other for that matter.&nbsp; What was required for a successful career was simply native intelligence, good people skills and an acute ability to observe.</p>
<p>There is a time and a place for higher education.&nbsp; I want my bridge-builder and aircraft designer to have a good basis in engineering, which can only come from concentrated study.&nbsp; I want my Family Practitioner and medical researcher to likewise have skills that only arise from concentrated study.&nbsp; But the simple reality is that we've allowed ourselves to be told that the only route to financial success is via a college degree and business hiring has now cast that into cement and again, the only winner is the institution of higher education.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - March 2016:&nbsp; The Human Face of Deflation</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The data is collected and calculated for the March 2016 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index and once again, the Index has declined as deflation now roars through the grocery stores.&nbsp; The PracticalDad Index marketbasket <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">consists of 47 items from a standard grocery store that are commonly purchased by a family on a budget.</a>&nbsp; These items compose the Total Index and for March 2016, the Total Index for this marketbasket was 102.86 (November 2010 = 100.00) and was down a full basis point from February's level of 103.86.&nbsp; The Food-Only Subindex is composed of the 37 foodstuff items within the basket and in March was actually less, at 102.85 (November 2010 = 100.00) and declined by a considerable 1.42 basis points from February's Subindex reading of 104.27.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's put this into perspective.&nbsp; The PracticalDad Price Index began in November 2010 as a kitchen-table project to ascertain what was actually happening to food prices on a family level.&nbsp; The Federal Reserve had commenced the first of three efforts at Quantitative Easing, an untried and novel approach to kickstart economic activity by flooding the financial system with liquidity.&nbsp; The QE programs were the brainchild of the then-chairman Ben Bernanke, an economics professor whose academic expertise lay in the errors of his Great Depression era predecessors in the effort to fend off the deflation that laid waste to the global economy.&nbsp; It was only natural that such an untried policy approach gave rise to immense debate over it's ultimate impact and whether it would fail, create the unicorn-like moderated inflation of 2% or tear the economy a new one that spewed a raging storm of inflation.&nbsp; Yeah, good times...&nbsp; But for all of the conversation about isolated items rising or falling in price, or the closely followed CPI, how would this play out in the marketbasket composed of items purchased by the common American family?&nbsp; And so the PracticalDad Price Index was born.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in five years and trillions of dollars created and injected into the Financial system by the Federal Reserve via three separate QE programs, what has been the result?&nbsp; From the period of November 2010 to November 2015, the Federal Reserve <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/quarterly_balance_sheet_developments_report_201511.pdf" title="more than doubled the asset holdings on its balance sheet">more than doubled the asset holdings on its balance sheet</a>, seeing an increase from approximately $3 Trillion to $7 Trillion while the DJIA during the period of November 2010 to March 2016 rose by 60%, from 11124 to 17829.&nbsp; The gap between the <em>uber</em>-wealthy and the average American increased in terms of amount of assets owned <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/13/us-wealth-inequality-top-01-worth-as-much-as-the-bottom-90" title=<a>by the top .1% - that's top <em>one-tenth</em> - now equals that owned by the bottom 90%.</a>&nbsp; So Ferrari and other luxury car firms sold more, and the prices taken by collector's artwork at auction increased as well.&nbsp; But that's on the upper end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>What's happened on the lower end of the spectrum is a far, far different thing.&nbsp; By 2014, the most recent year for which Census Bureau figures for median household income are available, the median household income <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2015/demo/p60-252.pdf" title="was 6.5% lower than the same category in 2007 ($53,657 vs $57,357), the last year prior to the Financial Crisis.">was 6.5% lower than the same category in 2007 ($53,657 vs $57,357), the last year prior to the Financial Crisis.</a>&nbsp; The number of Americans receiving SNAP benefits rose from 44 Million in December, 2010 to 45.4 Million in November, 2015.&nbsp; This is the human face of deflation:&nbsp; deflation isn't just prices mechanistically declining on a grocery-basket basis, it's the result of thousands of grocers and suppliers working to maintain sales and profitability in the face of lower incomes, competing demands and increased hunger amongst millions.&nbsp; Deflation occurs by substituting lower priced brands of food from cheaper suppliers across a broad range of foodstuffs.&nbsp; And if the quality has to suffer, so be it.&nbsp; Deflation is not a sudden event but instead a steady grind as economic pressures sand down incomes with the result that the suppliers and producers have no choice but to lower their prices so as to maintain sales and  hopefully, profitability.</p>
<p>When economists talk about inflation and deflation, it's treated much as any other abstract principal and the essential humanity behind them is lost.&nbsp; When I finally saw <em>The Big Short</em> with Middle the other week, I noted the scene in which two young hedge fund managers are in Las Vegas and break into celebration when they find that their mentor, Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt), has been able to secure the credit default swaps that will - hopefully - pay off massively when the housing market breaks.&nbsp; But Rickert simply stares at them and reminds them that for all of the statistics, there are people who will suffer.&nbsp; Lost homes and bankruptcies, broken families and dislocation, and the two become more grave at the reality.&nbsp; And so it is with deflation.&nbsp; Prices will fall, but there is a cost to it.&nbsp; The human face of deflation within the PracticalDad Price Index is one of hunger and quiet desperation.&nbsp; It is the face of millions of Americans requiring government assistance to put food on their tables.&nbsp; It is the face of the Food Bank manager who has to once again search out donors to help replenish the shelves for those in need.&nbsp; It is the face of the elementary school student who receives a backpack each Friday afternoon during the school year, filled with enough food to sustain her through the course of the weekend until she returns to school and a free lunch the following Monday.&nbsp; It is in the face of the elder who has to choose whether to spend precious funds on food or medication.&nbsp; It is the face of the Boy Scout who participates in an annual national food drive to replenish food banks, and whose family is possibly going to have to utilize that food in another week.</p>
<p>This project began out of an intellectual interest in what was occurring on a policy level.&nbsp; But maintaining it for the past five years - following the same 47 items - has become more than an intellectual exercise.&nbsp; It has brought an awareness of the faces within those stores and with that, a frank anger at the hubris and detachment of so many of the political and financial elite.&nbsp; Listen to what is being said and the manner in which it is presented.&nbsp; But most importantly, try to move beyond the language and see the effects upon the humanity which will ultimately feel the impact of the proposals.&nbsp; This affects our neighbors, co-workers and classmates.&nbsp; This affects us and most importantly, it affects our children.&nbsp; Because God forbid that the face of the youngster looking at the stark choice is our own child.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>On Being Sandwiched</title>
 <content:encoded><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>As we were, so you are.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>As we are, so you will be.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <em>Sign in the crypt of the Capuchin Order, Rome, Italy</em></p>
<p>You see some odd things as you travel and one of the oddest is the <a href="http://untappedcities.com/2013/07/02/capuchin-crypt-monument-of-human-bones-corpses-rome/" title="untappedcities.com">crypt of the Capuchin Friars in Rome.</a>&nbsp; It is a multi-room collection of the bones - some still full skeletons - of more than 3700 Capuchin Friars and others, assembled in various displays that in some ways are morbidly artistic.&nbsp; The captioned quote is on a sign in one of the rooms and serves as a graphic reminder to the tourist of the fleeting nature of life.&nbsp; I saw the sign <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/444" title="PracticalDad.com:  Lessons Learned on Traveling Overseas">during a family vacation several years ago</a> and noticing it served as the cherry on a thoroughly bizarre day.&nbsp; But the full import was lost on me until I became sandwiched between the youngsters and an elderly parent.</p>
<p>For most people, life is a Bell Curve and the plateau for the total person - mental, physical, emotional - is typically reached during middle age.&nbsp; When you have kids, you're at or near the top of your game and can focus on raising them, bringing them along and preparing them for their own adulthood.&nbsp; It is hard work, as the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704099704576288954011675900" title="wsj.com">Wall Street Journal noted in a groundbreaking article some years ago</a> - <em>seriously, when I first read the article years ago, I actually looked at the title and exclaimed "well, duh"</em> - and when you have more than one young child, the work explodes on a seemingly exponential level.&nbsp; But that work is also played out against a backdrop of anticipation, hope, love and at times, pure joy.&nbsp; But there will come a time when the Bell Curve starts to slope downwards and while you are still approaching, at, or near the plateau, your own parents will start to descend that slope.&nbsp; The parent's decline can be gradual and it certainly doesn't occur across all the phases - mental, emotional, physical - of the person.&nbsp; But there can and probably will come a time when there's a break in the elder parent's descent and it goes beyond the capacity of one or both parents to manage it in the moment.&nbsp; Falls that once would have left a bruise now leave a break and if the parent is sufficiently elderly, the break can create a cascade effect flowing further to the downside.&nbsp; Middle-aged moments of forgetting what you needed from upstairs become senior moments of forgetting to turn off a gas range or even where you live when you take a walk.&nbsp; These are the situations that bring the phone calls soliciting help from the elders and lead to an entirely new dimension of adulthood:&nbsp; parenting your own parent.</p>
<p>The slang term for the situation is <em>being sandwiched</em> because of the pressure that's felt from being responsible for both sides.&nbsp; While it makes sense on one level, it's also deceptive.&nbsp;  What's really happening is that you're simultaneously being stretched as the demands of each surrounding generation pull you in one direction and then in another.&nbsp; If you've waited to have children until you're older, then the stretch is even more pronounced as you might find yourself visiting both pediatrician and geriatrician in the same week.&nbsp; Trying to juggle making an appointment for the kid with the work schedule?&nbsp; Now toss in having to make an appointment for your infirm father and the tension from the stretch becomes palpable.&nbsp; As the American family has gone nuclear and mobile, creating physical distance between the adult generations, the response has been a budding growth industry for assisting the elderly when the adult children are absent.&nbsp; The elderly with sufficient assets can enter full-spectrum retirement communities able to meet their needs as they age; the parents can purchase a cottage and if and when the need arises, they can then shift to an apartment and later, be assured of a bed in assisted-living or skilled care.&nbsp; Want to stay at home?&nbsp; Purchase a chairlift for the stairs or modify the bathtub to account for increasing issues with balance.&nbsp; Hire a person to come visit for periods of time to combat the cumulative effects of isolation upon the mental faculties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a downside to this however and my wife noted it, in of all places, a commercial for <em>Priceline.com</em>.&nbsp; The gist of the commercial was that another market segment for discount travel was for those who needed to get to elderly relatives quickly and inexpensively, because emergencies don't allow the luxury of planning six months ahead for the best rates.&nbsp; In the commercial, an elderly woman was hiring someone to do repair work and the contractor was then coaxing her out of her social security number.&nbsp; That came on the heels of a recent phone conversation between my wife and her own mother, who'd related how an upset elderly neighbor had visited, frustrated that she had allowed herself to divulge her bank account information and number to an unknown person on the phone.&nbsp; This isn't to necessarily imply that all businesses oriented towards the elder market are shady, because they aren't.&nbsp; But it is a real and added concern for the adult children because they don't want to see their parents manipulated and gulled.</p>
<p>There is a common factor amongst the previous two paragraphs and it's one of which I am highly mindful as I look ahead:&nbsp; <em>assets</em>.&nbsp; We've predicated our family structure and society upon a model that requires assets for optimal performance.&nbsp; Americans are living longer and encountering aging issues that didn't exist before simply because people died before they could reach the point at which the issues became relevant in the aggregate.&nbsp; But the American family isn't in the same situation as it was during our grandparent's generation.&nbsp; The costs of healthcare and higher education are disproportionately higher relative to family income than two decades ago, yet the family and individual now must bear a greater burden than before...and on a family income that is, in the aggregate, declining.&nbsp; The private assets simply aren't there to support such a model for more than another generation and it's already leading to generational warfare between the likes of AARP and the Millenials as squabbling begins for the allocation of public assets.&nbsp; While raising children can bring the emotions of anticipation, hope and joy, what I honestly feel as I look forward isn't tension, but foreboding.&nbsp; On a personal level, is this something I can expect?&nbsp; Debility and dementia?&nbsp; Frustration and fear because I might be increasingly incapable of navigating a technological system that's opaque to an elder American for its complexity?&nbsp; <em>Hell, I have difficulty figuring out the new smartphone already...what's going to happen when I'm three-quarters deaf and expected to walk through an automated phone registration system for some program or another?</em>&nbsp; As my late grandmother used to say, <em>being old ain't for sissies.</em></p>
<p>That leads to the last aspect of being stretched.&nbsp; The model for aging in America will have to change and as we grope our way forward to whatever that new model is going to be, it's incumbent upon me to figure out how to model an appropriate behavior upon which my own children can draw as they move into adulthood.&nbsp; My own parents dealt with their parents from a nuclear family's distance of 225 miles, although one parent had a sibling nearby to her mother.&nbsp; Until the bitter end, it was managed via phone calls and the occasional visit to handle business and it's not terribly far removed from the way that many of their peers managed as well.&nbsp; But the stresses of American society are such that it's not so operative anymore and it will be better for all involved if the kids are more closely attuned to their parents' situation, even if they aren't necessarily living down the street.&nbsp; How often can I make medical appointments?&nbsp; How do I honor a parent's desire for independence and yet assure safety for the parent and others?&nbsp; What arrangements must I make if I'm responsible yet want to take a week vacation with the family?&nbsp; How do I manage my own frustrations as ancient issues resurface after decades of living on my own as an adult?&nbsp; What must I do to prepare so that I can be on good relations and make their own way easier as they eventually move into this role?</p>
<p>I'm a parameters guy.&nbsp; I don't believe that there's any one perfect way of addressing any situation.&nbsp; You determine the parameters within which you have to work and then figure out a mechanism that's best for the given set of parameters and even then, it's not going to be perfect.&nbsp; But I'm mindful that the parameters within which our country has operated are changing and doing so rapidly and that simply is creating additional pressure because we're now in the position of not just being sandwiched between generations, but being sandwiched between systems.</p>

<p>Almost all of us with kids have heard this phrase from their mouths at one time or another, especially if the child has a sibling.&nbsp; It's been a chronic complaint for generations of parents as the egocentric kids worry that Sib is getting more than they are, whether it's a smartphone, an Easy-Bake oven, a Hula hoop or a Dick Tracy detective kit.&nbsp; And the response of most parents is a sigh or groan and an explanation that the Sib is really not being treated preferentially.&nbsp; But does this age-old situation taken on a new face?&nbsp; Has the technology curve changed how we handle the concept of fairness and equity with the kids and how do we manage it?</p>
<p>From talking with my peers over the years, the common recollection was that most parents tried to maintain an almost mechanistic even-handedness in dealing with the kids.&nbsp; Like my own parents, if one child got a real desk at 10 years of age, then the next child received the same item at the same age.&nbsp; It was a realistic defense in dealing with the kvetching that comes from kids sensitive to anything that threatens their own perceived place in the world.&nbsp; And if anything can drive a parent batshit crazy, it's the constant grousing from one or more of the kids who chronically attempt to prove their point, as pointless as it may be.&nbsp; My own history was one of the mechanistic even-handed sort.&nbsp; My older sister got some milestone item at a specific age and when I reached that same age a few years later, I received a like milestone item.&nbsp; Desk?&nbsp; <em>check</em>.&nbsp; Decent bicycle?&nbsp; <em>check</em>.&nbsp; With many of my peers, it was a similar situation because typically, a kid didn't need a specific item until there was actually a perceptible need for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While my wife and I worked with this process through the early years of our children's lives, it has taken a decidedly different turn in the past several months because of technology, specifically laptops and smartphones.&nbsp; Until a few years ago, the family line was that there would be one family computer for the kids to share and that device was located in a common area of the house.&nbsp; None of the kids had laptops that could be removed to bedrooms and there were no smartphones; the word on mobile phones was that when circumstance dictated it, then a child got a cellphone.&nbsp; When Eldest was fifteen years of age and traveling to a distant city for a week-long event, we got her a cellphone.&nbsp; As her high school graduation gift, we footed a nice, high-end laptop that would last through college.&nbsp; Several years after Eldest blazed the way, Middle got a cellphone just before he was eligible to drive.&nbsp; His laptop however, was earlier since <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/675" title="PracticalDad:  When School Technology Programs Affect Family Policy">the school decreed that all students would receive free laptops for use</a> and lo and behold, a laptop appeared years before we had planned to foot for one and household guidelines had to be revised accordingly.&nbsp; When the school district redrew boundary lines for the various schools to rebalance the size of their respective student bodies, we found that Youngest would be attending middle school at the school that was the further away so he got a simple cellphone for use in case or emergency; this was at an age several years younger than his siblings.</p>
<p>But the push has been on for months about upgrading to a better phone and by better, I mean a smartphone.&nbsp; The repeated requests have been at Youngest's behest because his simple phone is incapable of handling the communications now used by his peers, all of whom possess one manner of smartphone or another.&nbsp; As one of his buddies commented, <em>Dude, you should get an Apple...we're an Apple family!</em>&nbsp; We've found that some of his friends will text with him simply because they're friends but he's the only one with whom they text and all else is handled via Instagram; this means that in oversight, there have been multiple events and get-togethers from which he's been excluded and despite subsequent apologies from his buddies, it still hurts.&nbsp; This realization has led to more discussion in the household.&nbsp; <em>Should we let the fact that he's the only one without the latest and greatest drive a family decision?&nbsp; What are the new family guidelines on smartphone use?&nbsp; How fair is it to the older siblings that he's received earlier access to technology and in some instances, by years?</em>&nbsp; Because Eldest was home visiting from college over a recent weekend, she responded that it was really irrelevant now.&nbsp; The communication platforms favored by the youngsters - even younger than the college crowd - has changed significantly from when she was that age less than a decade before and if it was interfering with his capability to have a healthy and active social life with his peers, then it was worth the upgrade.&nbsp; To be fully equitable however, we also upgraded Middle to a smartphone and as a favor to me, my wife also got me one as well.</p>
<p>So technological change has altered the question of maintaining a degree of fairness amongst the children.&nbsp; What we've seen is that the other factor which makes it more pertinent is the age differential between the various children.&nbsp; If you have only a few years between the children, then the matter won't be a potential booby-trap.&nbsp; But if you're talking anywhere around the vicinity of five or more years between the kids, then it's liable to be more of a concern.&nbsp; There are no right or wrong answers here.&nbsp; But it's worthwhile to be aware of the trip hazards as you negotiate the debate.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Dystopia Comes Home</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Teen and young adult dystopian literature <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/702" title="PracticalDad:  Something Wicked This Way Comes">has been around for a while</a> but it's darkly fascinating to see how the notion that something's just <em>not quite right</em> is percolating through society.&nbsp; So it was when I was chatting with Youngest one evening about his school day and found that he had an essay due along with the rest of his middle school English class.&nbsp; The topic was both surprising and more than a little disturbing:&nbsp; each student was to describe the one skill that they'd most prize should the economy collapse and things go to hell (my term, not his).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've known for a while <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/04/teen-stress.aspx" title="apa.org">that teens are feeling stress as acutely as adults</a> and that their stress is timed to the school year.&nbsp; The push for good grades and to ascertain what their career goals - not to mention getting into and funding the <em>right</em> school - make their teen years significantly more tense than it probably was two or three generations ago.&nbsp; But throw in the refrain that a college degree has now supplanted the high school diploma as the baseline paper for some degree of financial success and the understanding that they're likely to graduate with the equivalent car loan around their neck for a barista's position, and they get it.&nbsp; The question that it begs afterwards is how long this condition can last; more importantly, what happens to society afterwards?&nbsp; So their literature has come to mirror adult literature with authors tapping into the <em>zeitgeist</em> to work through the issues.&nbsp; Teens have seen their fictional societies ravaged by despotic regimes (Suzanne Collins' <em>The Hunger Games</em>), aliens (Rick Yancey's <em>The Fifth Wave</em>), nuclear post-apocolyptic societies (Veronica Roth's <em>Divergent</em> series), and zombies (James Dashner's <em>Maze Runner</em> and Charlie Higson's <em>The Enemy</em> series).&nbsp; Having seen each of these series come through the household with one child or another, I can only ask myself what else could possibly go wrong?&nbsp; </p>
<p>But this particular essay assignment doesn't have the Shakespearean <em>suspend your disbelief</em> quality that all of the previously mentioned series share.&nbsp; This has an immediacy that touches them deeply.&nbsp; Youngest's generation is a group that has seen parents downsized and has seen a suburban school district host clothing drives each year, an event that didn't exist until just a few years ago.&nbsp; A nearby city school district has a Friday <em>power-pack</em> program that hands out hundreds of food-filled backpacks to students so that they have food for the weekend and don't return to school the following Monday suffering from hunger.&nbsp; This isn't fiction and this isn't unbelievable.&nbsp; For them, this is real.&nbsp; I don't know what the teacher's thought process was behind the assignment and I don't know if that individual is a closet doomer or just looking to spur thought; I frankly don't plan to bother finding out.&nbsp; But it's still an eye-opening assignment.</p>
<p>So as Youngest and I spoke, I inquired as to what his response was and after sharing it with me, we talked further about it.&nbsp; My own comments afterwards were to what I myself would consider the most important skill set and not surprisingly, it had to do with the ability to determine what holds value for people and then knowing how to negotiate and barter.&nbsp; Because if the <em>s*&^ hits the fan</em> as the phrase goes, money will rapidly disappear and we'll be working on a barter basis.&nbsp; The conversation ranged to the highly practical - and cynical - view of human nature and that perhaps the family's stash of alcohol could be divvied into smaller containers for trade or supplemented with airline bottles.&nbsp; It might even be of benefit to further supplement the stash with a supply of cartons of cigarettes for trade.&nbsp; Is it an optimal outlook?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But this type of scenario is going to require a pragmatic and clear view of the world around us, very different from what out youngsters have come to expect in their politically correct school cocoons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's been an interesting thought experiment in the days since that conversation.&nbsp; If there is an economic collapse - and the constant 24/7 newscycle feeds that fear - what should you expect?&nbsp; What do you believe that would resemble and more importantly, what is your plan?&nbsp; How would you plan to handle the first several weeks if there's a Greek/Cypriot style clampdown on bank ATMs or even a wholesale bank holiday?&nbsp; Who is in your network of close friends upon whom you rely and in turn rely upon you?&nbsp; Most importantly, what and how do you teach your children so that they can make their way as self-reliant and capable adults in such a world?&nbsp; It's not a theoretical question but goes to the heart of being a parent since our primary job is to raise the children to become <a href="http://practicaldad.com/index.php/article/633" title="PracticalDad:  Memento">self-reliant, productive and moral adults capable of making their way in the world</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I doubt that my conversation about bartering booze and smokes necessarily fits into the category of moral, but it can help get through the immediate crisis period while we work on the other skills that would serve them better in the long-haul.&nbsp; And it's also part of our parental purview to help them determine what those skills are and how to foster them along.&nbsp; So make an effort to prompt them on their days and their assignments.&nbsp; The results can be more revealing than another piece of classwork designed solely to get them through the next standardized test.&nbsp; And a note to myself - get a final copy of Youngest's essay from his teacher.&nbsp; It's going to be an interesting read.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>So, Who Do You Like?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The question about the upcoming presidential primaries for the 2016 nominees has arisen on both end of the spectrums, from one of the kids as well as from my mother, who popped it during a lunch the other day.&nbsp; <em>So, who do you like?</em></p>
<p>While it would be a beautiful thing to be able to spit out a response in favor of a singular candidate - <em>because it's just time for a woman president, that's why</em> - I find that it's difficult.&nbsp; The reality is that the issue overshadowing all else is the control that the uber-wealthy and corporations now have over the legislative and electoral process.&nbsp; And by <em>uber</em>-wealthy, I mean those who have .01% of the nation's wealth...welcome back to the age of the Robber Barons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question arose again the other night where two of the three kids were gathered with us awaiting Middle's event.&nbsp; Both my wife and I looked at one another and the statements were identical and concise:&nbsp; <em>It doesn't matter.&nbsp; Taxes will go up regardless of who's in office and Sanders is the only one with the guts to acknowledge that that's going to happen.&nbsp; But if Trump makes his way into office, don't be surprised if they increase there either since it's a mathematical certainty that the revenue will only flow if the taxes go up...because God knows we can't control our spending.</em>&nbsp; We both elaborated further, knowing that the problems are wholly systemic and metastasized throughout the governmental body.&nbsp; <em>If you want to know the truth, the ideal candidate is already resigned to the notion that it will be a single term presidency and he/she will lose, if even willing to run for a second term.&nbsp; Because the system will have to be shaken to the core and if successful, that President will be hated and derided and probably for a generation.</em>&nbsp; To call it a sobering commentary would be an understatement.</p>
<p>Here's the thing behind the commentary.&nbsp; Twain wrote that while history doesn't repeat itself, it does rhyme and we're now in a literal nursery rhyme with <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/539" title="PracticalDad:  Andrew Jackson for President">Andrew Jackson's clash with Nicholas Biddle's Second Bank of the United States</a>.&nbsp; In that instance, Biddle put the screws to the country by betraying its role as the ostensible central bank and withholding funds from smaller banks in order to pressure the Congress to renew their original charter.&nbsp; This resulted in multiple small bank runs with the resultant ruin of thousands of depositors who lost all of their savings; but it also dramatized the threat that one or a few exceptionally wealthy and powerful individuals could pose to the body politic.&nbsp; In that instance, Jackson's response - combative and populist - was to withdraw the government's deposits from Biddle's bank, which served as the capital base for all that that bank was supposed to do.&nbsp; In essence, Jackson allowed the financial system to collapse in order to save the promise of the still very young Constitution.&nbsp; To do otherwise would have been to allow a single individual to use the power of the pre-eminent financial institution to gain control over the mechanism of government.&nbsp; If Jackson folded and Biddle won, what else would have happened - or not happened - if it displeased the banker.</p>
<p>And with the Supreme Court's 2010 <em><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205" title="oyez.com">Citizens United</a></em> decision that effectively quashed any campaign finance reform, please feel free to explain to me how this is any different from 180 years ago?</p>
<p>Some years ago, I used to spend considerable time on a wonderful financial/economics site and in the course of an evening's ongoing commentary with other members of that community, I commented this:&nbsp; <em>My hope is that when all of this is said and done, we come through everything with some semblance of an intact Constitution.</em>&nbsp; It sounds melodramatic, which I hate, but it's not at all far-fetched.&nbsp; The levers of power have been grabbed by the very wealthiest few and the corporations and they are actively solidifying their hold on said levers.&nbsp; President Obama's response in his first term should have been Jacksonian, moving to reform and re-institute meaningful regulation of the financial sector and he failed to do this.&nbsp; That <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/648" title="PracticalDad:  1837 Redux">an Assistant Attorney General was canned and his then-Attorney General later acknowledged that the fear of financial damage to the economy affects decisions on prosecutions</a> indicates the level of power of that sector and the fear that it engenders.&nbsp; And now that the heads of JPM Chase and Goldman Sachs have both become certifiable billionaires under this arrangement, the financial sector is wholly part and parcel of the cabal.</p>
<p>The threat to the country is no longer economic but now, for all intents and purposes, both Constitutional and existential.&nbsp; My thinking had been that the key factor to my choice of candidate would be what kind of person they'd likely nominate to the Supreme Court and how that individual would vote on such a decision as <em>Citizens United</em>.&nbsp; That decision was reached by the narrowest margin of 5 - 4 and the dissenting opinion by Justice Stevens - eminently worthy of the read <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZX.html" title="here">here</a> - is a good distillation of the ultimate controversy:&nbsp; with whom does the power reside?&nbsp; I have become convinced that the trade and monetary policies of the past three decades have been purposefully passed with the understanding that they will ultimately benefit only a relative very few and that, at the cost of the great majority of Americans.&nbsp; The hemorrhaging of the median family income isn't a sudden event, but instead only the damage arising from the effects of three decades of cumulative muggings upon the American Middle Class.&nbsp; Such is the effect of power moving to the control of a very self-interested few.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My thinking about the candidate that I'd support went to the type of individual that would be nominated to the Supreme Court.&nbsp; What would be the political persuasion and most importantly, their attitudes about the Constitution?&nbsp; Strict constructionist?&nbsp; Liberal?&nbsp; It does matter because as much as I can appreciate the constructionist viewpoint, the reality is that we have issues today that would make our Founding Fathers' eyes bleed.&nbsp; Some things are the same, yet some are simply not.</p>
<p>At the end of the evening, we found out that Justice Antonin Scalia had passed away earlier that day and the narrow majority that ruled in favor of the <em>Citizens United</em> decision was now moot.&nbsp; I was unaware of Scalia's age and believed that the decision to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice would wait until the next president but that assumption is now moot.&nbsp; It is the purview of any sitting President to nominate a person for the Supreme Court and for either side to cry for a delay is politics at its most venal.&nbsp; But make no mistake, with the average age of the Supreme Court north of 70 years of age, it's likely that the next President will also have the privilege of nominating a candidate.&nbsp; If President Obama does nominate someone who would shift that 5 - 4 margin in the direction favorable to overturning the <em>Citizens United</em> decision, it would still be only a razor thin majority.&nbsp; So that's what I'm considering as both sides of the political spectrum continue to throw the middle finger at the political class.&nbsp; Do I have a list of candidates for the Court should Trump, Sanders, Hillary or anybody else take office?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; But I'm not stupid either, and what they say - and how much money that they take - is a solid indication of where they'll go.&nbsp; And that's likely to be where I'll head, too.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - February 2016:&nbsp; Bare-Knuckle Price Fighting&#8230;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The pricing for the February 2016 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index is in with deflation in the 47 item grocery market-basket continuing.&nbsp; As I sat there researching background information to understand something, it occurred that what we're watching in the retail economy is best described as <em>bare knuckled price fighting</em>.&nbsp; There was a time when grocery stores were adding upscale coffee kiosks and organic produce sections to entice customers, but that's now in the past as stores are finding new ways to fight for the disappearing consumer dollar and it's creating a feedback loop for deflation.&nbsp; But first, the numbers from this most recent monthly pricing and then some comments both about what I'm seeing on the shelves and how this is impacting the Index.</p>
<p>The Total Index reading on the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">47 item PracticalDad Price Index</a> for February 2016 came in at 103.86 (November 2010 = 100), down from January's 104.54.&nbsp; The 37 food-stuff components sub-index for February was 104.27 (November 2010 = 100), likewise down almost a full basis point from January's result of 105.25.&nbsp; For the Food-only Subindex, this most recent result of 104.27 is fully 70% less than the high-point of that sub-index; it reached a maximum of 115.13 in December 2014 and has declined since that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there you have it.&nbsp; More than a half decade of artificially low rates pushing the zero-rate boundary to spur inflation and all of those trillions of dollars of additional liquidity wiped away in the fourteen months since that peak.&nbsp; Fourteen months and the aggregate pricing is now back at a level unseen since the summer of 2011.&nbsp; A pound of hamburger and a package of hot dogs are still more expensive than at the outset of the survey in November 2010, as are some other food items, but it's what has occurred with other items that provide a good explanation of deflation and what's occurring within the greater economy.</p>
<p>What's accounting for the ongoing deflation?&nbsp; Simply put, the grocers are doing everything that they can to fight for the average family's disappearing dollar - understand that one in seven Americans is now receiving government food assistance - and this consists principally of rolling out new products that cost less to produce, the lowest common denominator approach.&nbsp; I've noticed this within the past year as two of the three surveyed grocers - each part of a separate grocery chain - established new pricing policies that moved towards low prices on store-brand products.&nbsp; The third grocer is an independent whose store-brand within the past year has been completely replaced by another supplier with an across-the-board reduction in the price of each item surveyed.&nbsp; But what has happened within the past several months is that one of the grocery chains is now in the process of supplementing its store-brand product line with another line of products that are offered by a grocery industry GPO (Group Purchasing Organization).&nbsp; The savings on the products are significant; in the case of a can of vegetables, by a full 40% (from $.79/can to $.47/can) and this is being played out among other products within the basket.&nbsp; It's also led to a mental debate on whether and how to account for this shifting in the PracticalDad Index.</p>
<p>When the concept for the Index arose in 2010, the pricing was based whenever possible upon the lowest prices for the items and these were, in all instances, the store-brand (generic) lines of products.&nbsp; Name-brand items were only used when the lower-cost store-brands weren't available in all of the stores.&nbsp; These lower priced alternatives to the store-brands simply didn't exist in the products and it's only within the past few months that this has fed into multiple products.&nbsp; Should I account for them or not?&nbsp; Given that the baseline premise for the survey was a marketbasket of grocery items being purchased by a family with children living within an alloted monthly food budget, I opted to account for the product shift as these items would be purchased by the budget-conscious family in lieu of the now more-expensive store-brand items.&nbsp; These products aren't going away and the question that I have, based upon what I've seen in one of the chain's stores, is whether it will actually be the store-brand items going away instead.</p>
<p>I mentioned the term GPO in a previous paragraph and it's useful to explain what that is.&nbsp; A Group Purchasing Organization is actually an old concept now brought to the grocery industry.&nbsp; The first GPO was started in 1910 by the New York Bureau of Hospitals and centralized purchasing of medical items for a number of hospitals in order to maximize buying power and gain price concessions from manufacturers.&nbsp; This has long since caught on amongst other industries and holds true for the grocery industry as well.&nbsp; What the Index now reflects is that one of the surveyed grocers now offers the low-end brand created and marketed by a GPO named <a href="http://topco.com" title="topco.com">Topco Associates, LLC</a>.&nbsp; This GPO is a privately held concern consisting of more than 50 separate grocery retail chains across the country with aggregate revenues in the billions of dollars and the organization uses this buying heft akin to that used by Walmart to gain concessions from food producers.&nbsp; As I researched the concept of GPO for this article, I came across an online ad touting <em>Do you want to be like Walmart?</em>&nbsp; The <em>Walmartization</em> of the American economy continues and I wonder where it will end.&nbsp; As I write this, to my left is an orange can of low-cost coffee now offered by the other grocery chain as a supplemental choice to it's own store-brand coffee and I surmise that it's from yet another GPO (as yet to be determined).&nbsp; And as you'd expect, it's not good.</p>
<p>And now for the past six months of results.</p>

 <title>Driving Up the Cost of Higher Ed:&nbsp; Globalization and the Knowledge-Based Economy</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>A short while back, my middle child and eldest son - aka "Middle" - asked me how college costs managed to rise so disproportionately over the past several decades.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/783" title="The High Cost of Higher Education:  &quot;How in the hell did this happen?&quot;">resulting article</a> was a response to his question and looked at five different factors, each of which contributed to the present mess in the cost of a college degree.&nbsp; The first of these factors was Globalization and this article is the first of a series examining the factors in greater detail.</p></em>
<p><em>Globalization</em> wouldn't be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about why the cost of higher education has risen so dramatically in the past three decades.&nbsp; It frankly wouldn't be the second or third thing either, since the effect upon the cost of a college degree isn't primary.&nbsp; The impact is derivative instead, yet it's still important because it helped to pave the road for the persistent annual tuition increases as the institutions of higher education realized that there was now a massive and sustained rise in demand for their product:&nbsp; a college degree.</p>
<p><em>Globalization</em> is the economic principle that <a href="http://www.globalization101.org/what-is-globalization/" title="globalization101.org">economic progress and advancement is improved for everyone when there is a free-flow of capital, technology, resources and labor across the globe and unhampered by national borders.</a>&nbsp; It is supposed to be a sort of <em>rising tide lifts all boats</em> effect as the aforementioned inputs flow to that global region best able to utilize them to produce in the most efficient and effective manner.&nbsp; It is the linchpin concept behind the fiercely debated <a href="http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/north-american-free-trade-agreement-nafta.html" title="inc.com">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> of 1994 and the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/World_Trade_Organization.aspx" title="encyclopedia.com">World Trade Organization</a>, which was instituted by treaty in 1995.&nbsp; It's actually a reasonable concept and one that I didn't oppose when the debates occurred two decades ago.&nbsp; But where the issue had an impact on higher education was a subsidiary concept:&nbsp; the <em>Knowledge-Based Economy.</em></p>
<p>The Knowledge-Based Economy is of more amorphous origin, but the principle is predicated upon the notion that global resources are allocated where they can be most efficiently used until they can be brought to market as a final good or product.&nbsp; Since one of the basic variable costs in production is labor, it makes intellectual sense to shift lower-end manufacturing - requiring little education and training - to third world locations where a peasant can be paid a small fraction of what's earned by an American laborer.&nbsp; This would continue and the First World nations would be left to utilize their own resources in the conceptual, design and engineering aspects of the production.&nbsp; Higher-end and technical manufacturing would stay in the First World, at least until such time as the tides had lifted the other nations enough that they also had the intellectual and technical capabilities to support the design and engineering components.&nbsp; Corollary to the Knowledge-Based Economy was the Service Economy, where American workers would be spending their time providing higher end services to run and support the now-displaced production aspects elsewhere across the globe.&nbsp; I expect that some corporate visionaries envisioned a society in which the great mass of Americans became mandarin-like technocrats in a great machine that churned out profits enriching the lives of all privileged enough to participate.&nbsp; But I also now expect that there was another group of corporate visionaries who saw this as the opportunity to offshore all manner of labor costs so that unions could be undercut and profits grown.&nbsp; Understand one small yet highly significant fact from the early and mid-1980s:&nbsp; there was a shift in how corporate senior executives were paid and stock packages and options now became even more potentially lucrative than salaries authorized by a Board of Directors.</p>
<p>So now start to think of higher education in terms of supply and demand and this is probably where these principles began to have an impact upon the cost of a college degree.&nbsp; Preceding generations of young Americans had other alternatives to higher education so that there was less demand for it.&nbsp; Young males could be drawn off into the military via the demands of the draft and the Cold War.&nbsp; They also had options in sustainable, living-wage manufacturing and trades that did not require a degree.&nbsp; Fewer women pursued a college degree since there were fewer, then-socially acceptable career paths available to them.&nbsp; All of these factors meant that there was lesser demand for college, even though the GI Bill of 1944 had opened the spigot to higher education.&nbsp; But then changes began.&nbsp; The draft ended and the military shifted to an all-volunteer basis, followed two decades later by the end of the Cold War.&nbsp; Women began to achieve greater opportunities for careers and there was a decided societal push for women to obtain an education and then a career.&nbsp; And through the last three or more decades, the trickling shift of American jobs began and then became a torrent.</p>
<p>It was now here, at the end of the 20th century, that <em>Globalization</em> and the <em>Knowledge-Based Economy</em> became fully enunciated as guiding principles and the offshoring of American manufacturing began wholesale.&nbsp; The resultant demand for a college degree turned the college marketing and admission process into a literal cattle chute and the colleges and universities realized that they had become - for many Americans hopeful for a future - the only game in town.&nbsp; Even before this point, parents and guidance counselors pushed their kids to go to college so that they could <em>have a better, more fulfilling future</em>.&nbsp; Mike Rowe, of <em>Dirty Jobs</em> fame, wrote about this in <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a9333/why-work-smart-not-hard-is-the-worst-advice-in-the-world-15805614/" title="popularmechanics.com">Popular Mechanics in August, 2013</a>.&nbsp; He described a conversation with his high school guidance counselor in which the counselor touted the value of a college degree, even to a kid who wasn't certain of what he wanted except for the understanding that his own skill set might be more technical and practical than intellectual.&nbsp; I can attest to this type of conversation as well in my own experience.&nbsp; So there was already a presumptuous mindset about the value of college: &nbsp; but the increased demand that came from social change and the simple removal of other viable options simply drove everybody to the chutes.</p>
<p>But here's the thing about cattle chutes.&nbsp; Some of them lead to slaughter pens.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>The Cost of Higher Ed:&nbsp; &#8220;How in the Hell Did This Happen?&#8221;</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>PracticalDad note:&nbsp; The pace of writing over the past number of months slowed significantly, even to a crawl, but the conversations with the kids have continued regardless.&nbsp; Late this past summer, prior to his own departure to freshman year of college, I was talking with Middle about college costs and he looked at me and asked "how in the hell did this happen?"&nbsp; It's a great question deserving of an answer, but like so many others, not one that has an easy answer.&nbsp; What follows is a series of articles looking at the interconnected factors that have contributed to the disproportionately high cost of college.</em></p>

<p>Higher Education is a hot, steaming mess.&nbsp; If you look at the number of colleges and programs offered, you might not think so, but in terms of actually <em>obtaining</em> that college degree, it really <em>is</em> a hot, steaming mess.&nbsp; When you actually review the data, you find that the cost of tuition has risen <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-15/cost-of-college-degree-in-u-s-soars-12-fold-chart-of-the-day" title="bloomberg.com">more than 1100% since 1978</a> and what's even more food for thought is that the linked article was published four years ago, in 2012.&nbsp; Comparatively, the median American family income has risen <a href="http://www.davemanuel.com/median-household-income.php" title="davemanuel.com">only 269% in nominal dollars - a not-quite three fold increase</a> over that same 1978 - 2012 timespan.&nbsp; Factor in the disproportionate <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-15/cost-of-college-degree-in-u-s-soars-12-fold-chart-of-the-day" title="bloomberg.com">rise in the cost of healthcare by 601% over the same period</a> and acknowledge the fact that more of the burden of these same costs are now borne by the American family than in 1978 and you begin to understand why it's become such a hot-button issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But costs don't rise in such a fashion because they just levitate like so many feathers carried in the wind.&nbsp; There are reasons for this and the reasons are multi-fold and interconnected, one playing out upon another over the course of decades, unnoticed by the mass of people because they're engrossed in the very short-term necessities of either raising a family and living a life, or just binging on Netflix.&nbsp; From this perspective, there are five factors that have contributed to our present situation:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First, the effects of globalization and the shift to a "knowledge-based" economy.&nbsp; It used to be that entry into the fabled American middle class was predicated upon a sustainable, living wage job that could be had with just a high-school degree.&nbsp; That it was in a factory was acceptable since the employee could raise a family in a standard that was undreamed of during the Great Depression years, and it didn't require additional education unless the employee wanted it.&nbsp; But starting in the 1980s, companies and Wall Street began touting <em>globalization</em>, a principle whereby American corporations maximized their their profit for shareholders by shifting the lower-rung manufacturing overseas and retaining the higher-end positions here.&nbsp; In this model, Americans would design and engineer the goods that the world needed while the little brown and yellow people elsewhere would have to contend with the workplace drudgery and pollution that came with manufacturing.&nbsp; That you didn't need to provide a sustainable living wage and could get a 'tween-ager to manufacture a high-end pair of sneakers for pennies?&nbsp; <em>For the win, baby!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Second, there was a purposeful effort by companies in the late 20th century to alter their job requirements so that the baseline for hiring in a wide variety of positions was now a college degree instead of a high school diploma.&nbsp; That these same positions were now already successfully filled by capable high school graduates was irrelevant, a degree replaced the diploma as the baseline.&nbsp; There's certainly an argument for some of that being the result of a desire to move beyond what was perceived to be a failing public education system incapable of turning out satisfactory candidates.&nbsp; But I can speak from experience that there were other factors as well.&nbsp; The predominant reason was that as businesses made this move to a degree the hiring baseline, it created a ripple effect as their competitors felt compelled to do so in order to maintain the semblance of competitiveness, particularly in the eyes of their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Third, the effects of shifts in the funding paradigm for higher education.&nbsp;  Where a significant support previously was provided by the government, the burden of educating young people has shifted first to the family and within the last decade, to the student.&nbsp;  I don't believe that people truly understand the impact of the state and federal governments in the middle of the Twentieth Century upon higher education.&nbsp; On the one side of the house, the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 - aka <em>The GI Bill</em> - made significant educational funding available to millions of servicemen who returned home from the Second World War and literally provided higher education for an entire generation of young adults.&nbsp; On the other side of the house, state governments boosted spending for their state institutions through the next several decades until the amount spent per student climaxed and then began to decline in the 1980s.&nbsp; The ebbing has occurred in that while there are still educational benefits for veterans, we now have a volunteer military and the numbers of available recipients is far less than in the decade immediately following the end of World War Two.&nbsp; Likewise, purposeful budgetary funding per student by most, if not all, state legislatures has declined in the three decades since the Reagan Administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fourth, the shift to self funding by first the family and then the student was greased by years of low interest rates and the easy availability of credit.&nbsp; What's occurred with the funding of higher education is a microcosm of what's occurred within public society as well.&nbsp; As the Congress and Executive began two decades of vicious sniping and attack, it has devolved into a farcical situation in which there is no longer an agreed upon budget but instead a lengthy trail of continuing spending authorizations and debt limit increases.&nbsp; Because decisions can't be made and the debt continues to rise, the Federal Reserve has - and I hate to say it, but it's true - stepped into the breach to delay a day of reckoning by maintaining artificially low interest rates.&nbsp; So the financial role of government in higher education <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/634" title="PracticalDad.com">has shifted from fiscal policy laid out in conscious budgetary decisions to monetary policy as shown by the low cost of borrowing money.</a>&nbsp; Here's the difference between fiscal and monetary policy:&nbsp; fiscal policy is made by consensus, which is often messy and combative as issues are threshed through.&nbsp; Monetary policy however, simply acts to delay any decisions because there is no perceived cost to borrowing and hence, no need to actually make a decision; can't make a decision because it's too unpleasant to hash through?&nbsp; Don't worry, we can hold off because it won't cost much.&nbsp; On the micro-level of the student and family, the story line for years was that borrowing to finance your education was wise because it was <em>investing in yourself</em> and would pay off in the long-run.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fifth, all of the preceding factors braided together neatly to create an entitlement sense amongst higher education that it simply now had a captive market.&nbsp; And based upon the ways in which some of the institutions have spent their money, their perception has seemed to be that the market was in the French Quarter as college presidents and administrators strolled down the Rue amidst a shower of cash screaming out <em>laissez les bon temps rouler!</em>&nbsp; There was no perceived need to keep the spending down - apart from paying for pesky things like permanent faculty - since the money flowed and the steady flow of students continued.&nbsp; Money was spent on increasing administration, extraneous and honestly unnecessary programs of study and physical plant and student options that are high-end accessories as many of the institutions competed with one another.&nbsp; And yes, when your brochures are showing photos of climbing walls and Mongolian Grills as student dining options, then that would arguably qualify as high-end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's the short version.&nbsp; Like much else in America, we've gotten use to having plenty of options and choices without remembering that these options come with a price tag.&nbsp; As my father used to comment from time to time:&nbsp; <em>champagne taste, beer budget.</em>&nbsp; Over the next several weeks, I'll expand upon these factors individually because honestly, there's some fascinating stuff out there.</content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - January 2016:&nbsp; Welcome to the Jungle</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The pricing for the 47 item PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket is complete and after looking at the results, the one phrase that crossed my mind is <em>welcome to the jungle</em>.&nbsp; The changes that I'm seeing from one month to the next are symptomatic of what's occurring in the larger economy in multiple ways.</p>
<p>In terms of pure numbers, the 47 item January 2016 PracticalDad Price Index declined from December's 104.92 to January's 104.54 (November 2010 = 100) while the 37 Food-Only Subindex dropped more than a full basis point from December's 106.39 to January's 105.25 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; Please note that for the Food-Only Subindex, the cumulative decline from the December 2014 apex of 115.13 is now greater than 65%; it took more than four years of quantitative easing and loose monetary policy to bring that subindex for the 37 item foodstuff item marketbasket up by more than 15%.&nbsp; With the cease of QE and persistent economic pressure upon the family, it's only taken 13 months to undo it.</p>
<p>So how is this akin to a jungle?&nbsp; You have to understand why the three store average dropped as much as it did in one month - unbelievably (to me, at least), the cost of a pound of 80% lean ground beef actually dropped by an average of 5.4%.&nbsp; If you're going to store or watching the news, you'd be in company with me at this drop.&nbsp; But what was surprising - and informative - was the cause for the decline.&nbsp;All of the surveyed stores sold their 80% lean beef in store wrapped packages but last week, two of the three - each a part of a chain - were selling their 80% in a large, pill-shaped package called a <em>chub</em> instead of the usual packaging.&nbsp; I'd seen the chubs before, but they had always been for the lower margin/higher fat 73% lean and because they were not part of the survey, I'd simply ignored them.&nbsp; When the numbers were tabulated and the indices found, I decided to go back to the two stores to examine the beef further.&nbsp; Each of the chubs, now sold in the two chains, were produced by a firm called <a href="http://jbssa.com/" title="jbssa.com">JBS LLC, USA</a>; this is the American subsidiary of a Brazilian multinational meat packing firm founded in Brazil in 1953.&nbsp; As I perused further, I saw that JBS had done a serious job of growth via acquisition of firms both in the US and elsewhere.&nbsp; They have diversified first across types of protein so that they now produce poultry as well as beef and they've diversified vertically by the purchase of massive feedlot operations used to fatten cattle prior to slaughter; in 2008, they purchased Five Rivers Cattle Feeding to make them the largest cattle feeder in the world.&nbsp; They further extended their control by the 2010 purchase of the McElhaney Feedlot in Arizona, which increased their cattle feeding capacity by more than 130,000 head <em>at one time.</em>&nbsp; So the producer of the <em>chub</em> is a massive presence in the beef production industry.</p>
<p>What scares the central banks about deflation is that during the Great Depression, money became so scarce that many companies lost control of their ability to set and maintain prices, resulting in their ultimate bankruptcies.&nbsp; Competition amongst producers simply came down to which could survive long enough, a truly <em>dog eat dog</em> scenario.&nbsp; This is eerily reminiscent as money continues to flow out of the middle class and budgeted food dollars are replaced only partially by government food stamp programs, placing greater pressure on the grocers and by extension, the producers.&nbsp; As the preceding information about JBS SA shows, this is a firm that's built for survival via sheer economies of scale.&nbsp; What's also notable about this change in the offering of 80% lean is that the chub is now the package offering for a higher grade of ground beef.&nbsp; If you accept the proposition that the lower and fattier grades of beef are the province of those with less money, then a shift in packaging to the chub by a mass producer is an indication that the extent of the family budget woes are creeping throughout the middle class.&nbsp; Obviously, executives at the grocery chains are noticing drops in sales and are aware of why and rolling out a lower priced alternative is the logical response.&nbsp; However, this is not the kind of indicator that you want to see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The jungle metaphor also refers back to one of the great impact novels of the early 20th century, Upton Sinclair's <em>The Jungle</em>.&nbsp; Sinclair's book was a work that exposed the conditions of the meat-packing industry of that period and by extension, the conditions that prevailed overall when businesses were able to operate without any form of oversight to enforce the most basic sanitary conditions.&nbsp; It helped to establish the mindset that there was a legitimate role for government in the regulation of heretofore laissez faire competition.&nbsp; One of the later upshots of this was the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration to oversee the safety of what goes on the table.&nbsp; This isn't to necessarily say that the packing conditions are horrible and the product tainted, but when businesses get to the size that meat production is akin to factory conditions, then it does make me wonder.</p>
<p>And now to the results of the Indices for the past six months.</p>

 <title>Kids and Guns:&nbsp; Some Thoughts on Firearms in the House</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The sales flyer came to the house just a few days before Thanksgiving, a mailer from a well-stocked firearms dealer listing the daily special for each day between November 23 and November 30.&nbsp; The predominant weapon of choice for each day's special was a pistol and given the spate about mass shootings that culminated in the ISIS attacks in Paris, most of the daily specials were a smaller size that could easily be utilized by someone with a carry/conceal permit.&nbsp; Lo and behold, the data from the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/12/01/fbi-background-checks-for-gun-sales-peak-on-black-friday" title="usnews">FBI showed that background checks were done at a rate of 2 per second</a>, the highest rate in its history and higher than in the days after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.&nbsp; But even before ISIS hit our radar screens, our society was being hit with an increased rate of random shooter incidents as disgruntled individuals took to theatres, campuses and streets to shoot out their frustration upon the innocent and the public sense of safety diminished accordingly.&nbsp; Gun control rhetoric has ratcheted upwards - when the NY Daily News <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NRA_NYDN_covers-800x430.jpg" title="rawstory.com">photoshops the NRA's Wayne LaPierre's face onto the body of an arab terrorist</a>, then rhetoric is officially on a car-lift - and the response of many is to wonder about society's ability to maintain some sense of order.&nbsp; <em>If public order is slipping</em>, goes the thought<em>, then perhaps I need to act to protect myself and my family</em>.&nbsp; It's a legitimate concern and the reality is that many thinking it have children - and no previous experience with gun ownership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you're in this position, what are some of the things that you should consider?&nbsp; Let me start off by giving a full disclosure:&nbsp; I have been in this position and am now a gun-owner.&nbsp; This article won't go into details about specific steps to take, but it will take a look at some of the broader issues for parents considering firearms in the house.&nbsp; It's a daunting prospect given that the there's real potential for accidental death and injury to children and teens; in 2013, <a href="https://injury.research.chop.edu/violence-prevention-initiative/types-violence-involving-youth/gun-violence/gun-violence-facts-and#.VmmnNb-E4_8" title="Gun Safety Statistics:  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia">more than 1600 American children died from accidental shootings and more than 9700 were injured</a>.&nbsp; Let me also state this:&nbsp; this is also neither an endorsement for or against the decision to bring a firearm into the household.&nbsp; That is your decision and you are responsible for any consequences that might occur.</p>
<p>Even before you get down to the brass tacks of responsible gun ownership, there are some basic issues to consider.&nbsp; The first is to think about your own experience with firearms.&nbsp; In my case, my father was a Korean War veteran who returned home from the war and sold every piece of his hunting, fishing and camping equipment so I not only had no experience with firearms, the household environment was one of absolute avoidance.&nbsp; I recall him telling me as a teenager that he wanted no weapon in the household because if he ever was in the position of having to pull it on somebody, it would be with the intent of killing that person.&nbsp; My wife, on the other hand, was raised with a father who worked in the judicial system and was consequently around guns her entire life.&nbsp; It frankly took years for me to adjust to the concept of having a firearm in the house and it didn't happen until the kids were older and I was far more comfortable with the notion.</p>
<p>The second issue is to honestly consider your own experience with maintaining self-discipline and whether you keep up with the requirements of anything that you take on.&nbsp; Are you willing and able to follow-through on a regimen of assuring that the household weapons are not only properly stored, but are even clear of bullets in both the chamber and magazine?&nbsp; More important than that, if you plan to keep a loaded firearm in the house, how will you secure it so that the kids don't get hurt?&nbsp; <a href="https://injury.research.chop.edu/violence-prevention-initiative/types-violence-involving-youth/gun-violence/gun-violence-facts-and#.VppHHFKE4_9" title="chop.edu">Almost three quarters of surveyed children under 10 know where their parents keep the weapons and more than a third of those kids admitted to the surveyor that they'd handled them without their parents' knowledge.</a>&nbsp; When in elementary school, I lived for a period up the street from a family whose father was an avid hunter.&nbsp; I vividly recall that I'd visit his sons and the boys - my own age - would pull the rifles and shotgun from the closet and play with them in my presence and without the parents' knowledge.&nbsp; <em>Don't think that the kids won't know about the guns or won't find them, because they will.&nbsp; Even "good" kids are curious and will rummage around closets and even dresser drawers when you aren't around.</em></p>
<p>Following on the heels of that is the question of how well your own kids listen to what you say and whether or not they heed it.&nbsp; It's an unpleasant question and goes back to the heart of your own ability to maintain discipline amongst the kids in the household.&nbsp; Two of the keys to successful discipline are whether or not you have a history of both <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/155" title="practicaldad.com">consistency in your discipline</a> and having a reputation amongst your kids of <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/156" title="practicaldad.com">enforcing your discipline</a>, or whether they understand that you won't follow through on what you say you'll do.&nbsp; If you believe that the kids will mind you, then you have to decide on the guidelines for having them in the house and - if you tell them about their existence - what the repercussions are for the kids if they break those rules.&nbsp; Kids actually do better if they understand the consequences of their actions since it gives them a clear indicator of something's seriousness.</p>
<p>What precisely is driving the decision to keeping a weapon in the house?&nbsp; Bad news sells and the media will willingly play up the negative because it jacks up the angst and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/10/the-head-of-cbs-stated-the-obvious-about-why-the-media-likes-donald-trump-it-still-feels-wrong/" title="washingtonpost.com">brings in the dollars.</a>&nbsp; What is happening with the crime rate in your area?&nbsp; Do you live in the city or are you in a more remote rural area with a longer police response time?&nbsp; If you do opt to keep a weapon in the house, then be sure to familiarize yourself with the state and local regulations on guns and home self-defense.&nbsp; Contact your local law enforcement officials or your state representative, or just Google the damned thing, to see what seminars and classes are being offered locally so that you have an informed base on your legal responsibilities as a gunowner.&nbsp; It's highly instructive to hear the local District Attorney discuss the process on what characterizes legitimate acts of self-defense versus something that is legitimately prosecutable as a crime.<p>
<p>Ultimately, if you are going to teach the kids about responsible gun ownership, what are you going to do to teach them?&nbsp; I would suggest that if you aren't someone who's familiar with firearms and are learning now, you find someone who can teach them adequately.&nbsp; They can learn both a respect for the firearm and household rules from you, but actual hands-on training would probably be better with an experienced individual.&nbsp; Our own case was that all of us - myself, wife and kids - took individual sessions in gun safety and marksmanship with a man who was a former Marine non-com and combat veteran and taught practical weapons usage; my comments to all of the kids prior to their sessions was that he's earned the respect and <em>I will make your life unpleasant if you refer to him as anything other than Sir or Mister.</em>&nbsp; But even after that training, what will you do?&nbsp; Target shooting has become a requested father/child activity with one of my kids and both of the others have gone on to earn the <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/BoyScouts/AdvancementandAwards/MeritBadges/mb-RIFL.aspx" title="BSA Rifle Shooting merit badge">BSA Rifle Shooting merit badge</a>.&nbsp; As with anything else, practice and repetition breed comfort and familiarity.&nbsp; But it's up to the parent to assure that familiarity doesn't give way to contempt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you walk through all of the questions and still think that you're both ready and willing to bring a firearm into the household, then you need to consider both the mental/emotional and physical capabilities and constraints of the kids themselves.&nbsp; Does your child have the maturity or even the mental capability of allowing a firearm in the house?&nbsp; Is your child capable of learning how to use what you decide to bring in or is it beyond their physical constraints for his or her age?&nbsp; If you purchase a weapon that the child is physically unready to handle - whether by grip size or recoil - you had better be damned sure that you've secured it.&nbsp; If you want your child to try a firearm, make absolutely certain that you've considered these capabilities.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/02/girl-who-accidentally-shot-her-instructor-with-an-uzi-said-the-gun-was-too-much-for-her/" title="washingtonpost.com">The incident in which a gun-range instructor was killed by a nine year-old girl firing an Uzi</a> was a stunningly colossal failure in judgment by the girl's parents as well as the gun range owner and the instructor himself.&nbsp; As with anything else, take the time to explore the opinions and experiences of others with firearms.&nbsp; In talking with other fathers about purchasing a rifle, knowing that their own children used them and my own probably would, I found a difference in opinion on the most basic aspect of the rifle:&nbsp; single-shot or magazine load.&nbsp; Several fathers believed that starting with the basic single-shot bolt action was important as it forced the inexperienced user to slow down and think about the shot while others had no issue with going directly to the several shot capacity magazine load.</p>
<p>There is no clear across-the-board answer on whether to bring a firearm into the household.&nbsp; After walking through the issues - those of attitude, safety and practicality -  some parents will opt to not take the risks that come with gun ownership while others will decide that they simply cannot accept those risks.&nbsp; Either answer is correct if you've done your full due diligence.&nbsp; But the common element in either decision is a full review of the factors involved.&nbsp; That is the ultimate breakdown in responsibility - failing to walk through the different aspects to the final decision.&nbsp;</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - December 2015</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The data for the December 2015 PracticalDad Price Index was collected and calculated in the past three days and as I worked my way through the refrigerated aisles of the stores, I could only wonder about the price of eggnog.&nbsp; This is the time that the dairies start rolling out the eggnog and knowing how the price of eggs has risen because of Avian-Influenza effects upon the national supply, I wondered about the lag-effect as this works through the food-supply chain.&nbsp; It certainly happened with the price of sweetened cereal (store brand frosted flakes) after the price of sugar rose because of hot money flows into physical commodities several years ago during one of the QE periods.&nbsp; But it's not something covered routinely because it's simply not routine and frankly, it's pricey enough that the typical family isn't going to spend money on it.&nbsp; So musings aside, what happened to the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index - November 2010">47 item marketbasket</a> this month?</p>
<p>Frankly, there was only a minimal increase in the Total Index for the 47 item basket, rising from November's 104.79 to December's 104.92 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; The 37 foodstuff item subindex likewise rose from November's 105.97 to December's 106.39 (again, November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; Bear in mind that the Food-Only Subindex now at 106.39 peaked a year ago in December 2014 at a high of 115.13, so it's still down 58% from it's all-time high only a year ago.&nbsp; There have been no new product substitutions made by the grocers, in which one grocer completely replaced it's store-brand line at a markdown on products across the board.&nbsp; Remember that the grocers have very thin profit margins and will be most sensitive to the spending patterns of their customers; as money flees the economy, they'll be the first to notice the changes in spending patterns via the profit per item on the available shelf space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question now is this:&nbsp; as the Federal Reserve prepares to increase the discount rate for the first time in years - via a withdrawal of money from the system by way of reverse repos - what will happen to these food prices?&nbsp; Probably nothing in the immediate future, but after several months...<em>look out below.</em></p>

 <title>Whither Thanksgiving?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There have actually been occasions when I've written because I've been wrestling with a particular issue and the process of writing has helped to clarify points and issues for me.&nbsp; This is going to be one of those articles and yes, it does pertain to how a larger American practice is impacting the PracticalDad household.&nbsp; Most specifically, do I go out for "Black Friday" Christmas shopping on Thanksgiving Day itself?</p>
<p>In the past two decades, <em>Black Friday</em> has taken on an entirely new focus in American culture.&nbsp; I used to think that the term was a pejorative amongst shoppers and retail staff to describe the conditions that prevailed as people crammed into stores and waited in lines for special <a href="http://retail.about.com/od/marketingsalespromotion/a/loss_leaders.htm" title="retail.about.com">loss leader products</a>; I later learned that it actually referred to the accounting ledgers of many retailers, who hung on at a loss through the year as they awaited the post-Thanksgiving holiday buying season and the chance to move into the profitable black.&nbsp; As a kid, I knew that the folks would take us out on the weekend immediately after Thanksgiving for a Christmas buying spree but over the ensuing decades, that time span between the holiday and the shopping start has shortened.&nbsp; My own experience with <em>Black Friday</em> began more than a decade ago when a close friend - my <em>may-as-well-be</em> sister invited me to join her for a pre-dawn excursion to shop for presents at a now-defunct mall toy-retailer.&nbsp; This entailed getting to the mall at 330 AM to find a good spot in line for the 530 AM store opening; the other mall stores would open around 6 or 7 AM.&nbsp; This began more than a decade-long tradition of grabbing the pre-Thanksgiving newspaper for the shopping ads, which she and my wife would study to find those items that might best work for the Christmas lists for the half-dozen kids that comprised our two households.&nbsp; It became an exercise in <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/travelling-salesman" title="plus.maths.org">the travelling salesman problem</a> as we would split up lists and hit multiple locations and the cellphone made it a logistical effort worthy of transporting an army battalion.&nbsp; As our kids aged and wanted to get into the act, this would be multiplied and we'd have four or more individuals in multiple locations, all searching out their particular item for another person in one of the two families and it became a rite of passage for the youngsters to join in the fray.&nbsp; The culmination of the experience would be lunch with any combination of the two families before heading home for a return to regular activities.&nbsp; When Youngest was finally old enough to come along for this established tradition, the rest were old enough that they'd moved beyond the toy phase and time had worked it's natural change upon the process.</p>
<p>Time also worked its own change upon the larger process as the stores opened earlier and earlier and that 530 AM opening became an almost quaint anachronism.&nbsp; More stores opened at 530 AM and earlier and then the push to be first moved the opening times even earlier into the early morning hours.&nbsp; This has become a vicious cycle as stores - desperate for sales in an economy with a faltering middle class - continuously pushed the time envelope back further and further until only the other year when suddenly, stores were opening on Thanksgiving evening itself.&nbsp; As I sit here and think about it, three of the stores at the forefront of the early Black Friday morning sale - KB Toys, Circuit City and Linens 'n Things -  now defunct; it would seem that the desperation by these dying retailers fed a frenzy that's taken on a life of it's own.&nbsp; But there's now a pushback as stores now purposefully advertise their willingness to let the employees have time with their families and people take note of the seeming callousness of the ones opening Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p>So here's the crux of the situation.&nbsp; I agree that the stores should stay closed on Thanksgiving and hadn't planned to go out until early Friday morning.&nbsp; Yet both Eldest and Middle will be working on Thanksgiving Day - one at a mall retailer and another at a local restaurant - and my own family's Thanksgiving meal is purposefully being moved up to an earlier time to accommodate the evening work shifts.&nbsp; Youngest has also asked for a specific item that's being sold as a loss leader at a retailer with a 6 PM opening on Thanksgiving evening.&nbsp; He's agreed that the item is costly enough that he's willing to contribute to defray the total cost and now the question is whether I go to the retailer in an attempt to purchase the item.&nbsp; Given that it's a loss leader that would be far more expensive elsewhere, it's certain that I'd also be leaving far earlier in order to stand in line.&nbsp; So do I just acknowledge the practicality and give in to an already shot family Turkey Day or do I say no?</p>
<p>So that's where I'm at.&nbsp; But whatever is decided, I hope that you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving.&nbsp; We'll see what happens.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - November 2015:&nbsp; Deflation Reigns&#8230;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>When I began the PracticalDad Price Index in <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">November 2010</a>, there was significant controversy over the outcome of the untried experiments of the Fed's Quantitative Easing:&nbsp; would there be a rocketing ascent into a massive hyperinflation or would the economy collapse into a deflationary black hole?&nbsp; Given the speed with which opposing events occurred both in the Weimar Republic's Hyperinflationary spiral in the early 1920s and the Great Depression in the early 1930s, it was generally supposed that whatever occurred would be quick and massive.&nbsp; But we're now more than five years from the onset of the Index and the third and last QE program has finished and it's only now that prices are moving far more quickly in one direction than the other.&nbsp; In this case, downwards.</p>
<p>The index began with a baseline of 100 as of November 2010.&nbsp; The 47 item marketbasket, priced at three separate and unrelated grocery stores, consisted of 37 foodstuff items and 10 non-food items commonly purchased at the grocery (soap, kitchen trash bags, aluminum foil, ibuprofen and the like).&nbsp; From this data each month was derived the Total Index (November 2010 = 100) and the Food-Only Subindex for the 37 foodstuff items (again, November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; While the QE programs existed, both the Total Index and the Subindex rose upwards, although not at a constant or large rate.&nbsp; The Food-Only Subindex actually peaked in December 2014 at a reading of 115.13; the cost of the consistently priced average basket had maxed at 15.13% higher than at the inception over four years previously.&nbsp; But since then, the Subindex has dragged the Total Index downwards at a stunning rate.&nbsp; As of the November 2015 data collection in the three stores, the Subindex has again dropped from October's level of 107.07 to 104.79; this is a full 68% decline from the high reached eleven months previously.</p>
<p>Here's some perspective:&nbsp; it took more than four years for a consistently priced market basket to reach a high 15% above it's starting point.&nbsp; And it's only taken less than a quarter of that time to give back more than two-thirds of that increase.</p>
<p>So what's behind the collapse in the market basket's food prices?&nbsp; This is absolutely deflationary, but why?</p>
<p>Understand more than anything else that inflation is not a monolith.&nbsp; It might be a wild beast when utterly untamed, such as in the 1920s German Weimar Republic, 1990s Zimbabwe or even today's Venezuela...but it's a Hydra and each head is one of the various sources of price increases.&nbsp; One source of price increases comes from hot money flowing into a particular area of the economy, such as San Francisco in the years prior to 2006.&nbsp; There's only a limited supply of something - San Francisco properties - and <em>everybody</em> with money has to have some, so prices go up.&nbsp; Until they don't any longer.&nbsp; Another source is when there are only a limited number of significant suppliers of a particular item and one or more decide to raise prices to pad the profit margin.&nbsp; This was the case with Kimberly-Clark raising the price of adult diapers because they wanted to pad the profit margin.&nbsp; This is also now the reason that housing rental rates are higher and growing moreso as the predominant American landlord is no longer some Mom-and-Pop but instead <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-01-09/do-you-pay-rent-blackstone-where-wall-street-americas-landlord" title="zerohedge.com">Blackstone Investment Group</a> of downtown Manhattan.&nbsp; Have you ever seen the neatly printed yard and corner signs offering a toll-free phone number and a standing offer to buy your house for cash?&nbsp; Have you ever wondered who that is with all of the cash?&nbsp; That's Blackstone, at least in my neck of the woods.</p>
<p>Bastards.</p>
<p>But the biggest head on Hydra is the money supply, most notably measured in Economics by both velocity - the number of times that a dollar is turned over in the economy during a specified timeframe - and family income.&nbsp; We all know that family incomes have declined but the monetary velocity for the supply of money (M2 as measured by the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank) has decreased to lows <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M2V" title="FRED:  St Louis Federal Reserve Bank">unseen in the lifetimes of most Americans</a>.&nbsp; When a family gets a dollar, they will now sit on it, far moreso than in the previous six decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So apart from housing, what is the other principal category upon which a family spends it's money?&nbsp; Food.&nbsp; And it's here amongst the thin-profit-margin grocers that deflation truly seems to be appearing.&nbsp; The grocers - corporate and independent alike - understand that their customers are stretched and are doing all manner of change to maintain sales and profits.&nbsp; The Fed is terrified of a return to Great Depression-style deflation because the businesses lost all control of pricing as money disappeared from the economy and went out of business.&nbsp; Today's competition amongst the grocers is no longer based upon upscale stores and coffee kiosks but instead pricing, and bare-knuckle at that.&nbsp; When a supplier is deemed to no be longer able to provide a cost-beneficial product, that supplier will be replaced by another that will; this is perhaps the key reason that the prices in the three local grocers are declining.</p>
<p>One of the parameters of the survey since its inception is that unless unavailable, all products within the PracticalDad market basket are store brand items.&nbsp; If one of the three did not have a store brand item, then I shifted to a name brand across all three but that's only occurred in a handful of the surveyed items.&nbsp; The idea behind the parameter was that budget minded shoppers will generally forego a name brand in favor of the store brand based upon price considerations.&nbsp; It is also far more sensitive and responsive to prevailing economic factors than the name brands' manufacturers, who usually have the financial strength to absorb periodic downturns.&nbsp; One of the grocers surveyed completely swapped it's store brand supplier for another several months ago and across the line of products within that store's basket, the prices declined.&nbsp; What occurred this month was that another grocer found an even cheaper supplier and introduced some items from that supplier alongside their store brand products.&nbsp; There's been a tie-breaking rule that I adopted at the outset of the Index project in late 2010 and have used only rarely since:&nbsp; in the event of any question, what would a true budget-driven consumer do?&nbsp; I invoked the rule this month and used the lower priced item, even if not a store brand; the file has been amended and this grocer's items will be used in lieu of the store brand products.&nbsp; These items at one grocer were the movers behind the Index decline and should the same situation occur again, the rule will be invoked again.&nbsp; So that is why we stand where we stand at the moment.&nbsp; Families must stretch earned dollars and food benefit dollars further to stay afloat and it's here at the most local level, the grocery store, that the stretch is occurring.&nbsp; Because the grocers have competition to meet for the dollars and none of them will throw a family to the curb when the rent isn't met.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Veterans Day</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Scrolling through the feed on the Facebook timeline brings a litany of <em>thank you for your service</em> messages to all manner of Facebook friends and their family members.&nbsp; It is a well-deserved custom that's spawned from the disgust at how the Vietnam vets were treated when they returned home.&nbsp; Yet we need to be careful that it doesn't become a thoughtless, <em>de rigeur</em> statement that's thrown off as easily as a meaningless compliment because many of us never served - a large percentage of the population hasn't served - and we generally don't have a solid grasp of history and the fights in which they've been involved.&nbsp; It's changed cinematically as many have now seen the early carnage of the seasonal replays of Spielberg's <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> or Ridley Scott's <em>Black Hawk Down</em>, but there's still a quantum leap between the family sofa and hunkering down behind a pile of rubble.&nbsp; We say the right thing, but the great majority simply don't get it.</p>
<p>While I think about my own father often, I always reflect more on Veteran's Day and reading all of the <em>thank yous</em> made me even more thoughtful.&nbsp; Dad's been dead for almost 14 years.&nbsp; We knew growing up only that he'd been in the service during the Korean War but it was something that he never - <em>never</em> - discussed.&nbsp; I once asked him when I joined Boy Scouts if he'd come along camping with me and he demurred with a gruff <em>I spent a year sleeping outside and I promised myself that I'd goddamned well never do it again so no, I won't.</em> But he'd say no more than that.&nbsp; Since this was an old established troop with a strong tradition of outdoorsmanship, I caved in to my intimidation and quit.&nbsp; When I later asked him - during middle school - about his experiences, he simple refused to discuss it and the matter was dropped.&nbsp; It wasn't until many years later, when he learned that my then-medical student wife was doing a rotation at the local VA, that he opened up one evening and began to talk and between that evening and the years afterwards, the stories flowed and so much that I couldn't puzzle out in my youth became clear.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Dad had been in Korea at the outset, a mere tech sergeant doing work near the 38th parallel when the North Koreans invaded; he and his squadmates were cut off and spent days - with the loss of several of his men - escaping before being found by American troops and receiving what he termed a battlefield transfer.&nbsp; This receiving unit was the 27th Infantry Regiment, the Wolfhounds, and he spent almost the next year with them before finally rotating back stateside to finish his enlistment as a drill instructor.&nbsp; He related incidents of leaving a makeshift bar in a shack in Pusan to literally cross the road to repel a massed North Korean attack in the blackest days of that conflict, of seeing his buddy so drained by the violence that he killed one of his own pilots in a barfight after warning him to stop  badmouthing the infantry who were being pushed relentlessly backwards.&nbsp; A few years before he died, I learned that whenever he was in the Midwest on business, he'd take an extra day and stop at Fort Leavenworth to visit this man.&nbsp; Dad spoke of massed Chinese attacks after they entered the war and how the differential in sizes between the American bayonet and the outsized Chinese bayonet, aka <em>the pigsticker</em>, gave birth to decades of nightmares.&nbsp; There were other stories but it was even later after his retirement in 1991, that more became evident.&nbsp; Dad finally came to terms with his experience and contacted his congressman to help in obtaining the citations for which he knew that he'd been nominated but had opted to never touch before then; it required additional effort since the Veteran's archive in which his records were kept was badly damaged in a fire decades before with the loss of an untold number of servicemen's records.&nbsp; When the congressman's office finally finished helping him, we found that these included the Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for courage under fire.</p>
<p>I have no photos of my father in uniform, although I do recall seeing one photo of a young man wearing glasses and a helmet, kneeling in the dirt outside of Fort Bliss, Texas.&nbsp; It wouldn't surprise me if he handled them the way that he handled all of his camping and hunting equipment when he later returned home to the Laurel Highlands of Western Pennsylvania...he simply got rid of all of it and promised himself to never do them again.&nbsp; His decorations and division and regimental insignia are safely put away although I do, on occasion, pull them out to look at them and think about the old man.&nbsp; He certainly mellowed with age but the experience changed him forever.&nbsp; I recall seeing him watch an Army recruitment commercial - <em>Be all that you can be...</em>- and just rolling his eyes while he shook his head.&nbsp; When I discussed with him the idea of enrolling in ROTC during college, he argued against it and persuaded me to put the notion to rest and that there was no reason to feel guilt for not doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So would I tell my father <em>thank you for your service</em>, as insufficient as it might seem?&nbsp; Now it would seem to be the least that I could do, although it absolutely isn't enough and his response would be a typical <em>if you feel that strongly about it, then get your head out of your ass and actually do something.</em>&nbsp; And that's what we should do for these men and women who are serving.&nbsp; Pay closer attention to the controversy occurring in the Veteran's Administration and if you aren't vocal, become moreso.&nbsp; Learn about the service dogs that are increasingly taking an important role to provide an emotional anchor for returning vets and throw support to those who raise and train them; in a short attention span society, we forget that the effects of combat stress can last for decades and the canines won't be a one-off effort.&nbsp; Most important is this, however:&nbsp; understand that we are now entering a time in which the promises made to all of the various constituencies in American society can no longer be supported by the resources available to us.&nbsp; We can no longer run endless deficits without burning out the engine and at that time, we're going to have to renegotiate the social contracts that have bound us together and it will be a truly ugly process.&nbsp; It will be then that you'll have to remember what many of the vets suffered through and advocate forcefully on their behalf and in that way, you can begin to repay the debt owed them and show that their service truly isn't forgotten.</p>

 <title>Managing the Decline</title>
 <content:encoded><p>We live in an increasingly gender-neutral society as customary roles continue to change, in some ways slowly and in some ways, not.&nbsp; We're now more than two decades into the <em>stay-at-home-dad</em> scenario and it's gone from a notable phenomenon to a far more widespread and mundane situation.&nbsp; If you aren't certain about that, pay attention to that faithful barometer of social change, the television commercial.&nbsp; We've  moved from the standard <em>means-well-but-clueless-in-the-household-Dad</em> across a broad range of products to considerably more commercials where Dad is actively engaged in managing the household and interacting with the kids.&nbsp; The former still exists but it's not as prevalent as it once was.&nbsp; But as this continues to progress, men had better get used to the fact that there's liable to be a point in their middle-aged lives when they'll not only be responsible for managing the rise of their children but also the decline of their parents.</p>
<p>There are most certainly cultural influences.&nbsp; China's society is one in which the son is responsible for the ultimate care of the parents and that - coupled with their long-standing one child policy - has led to a profound imbalance in the male/female ratio as newborn girls were given up for adoption so that the parents could have another shot at having a son.&nbsp; But American culture has historically been predicated upon the daughter having principal responsibility for the care of her aging parents.&nbsp; The model with which we've been familiar through our lives has been, until relatively recently, one in which the man worked and the woman was responsible for the household responsibilities and that extended to caring for their aging parents.&nbsp; It's been stretched considerably with the rise in mobility and the nuclear family, and even further by the movement of the woman into the workplace.&nbsp; This has been offset by the growth of local and state government programs to provide increased assistance for the elderly and the great majority, if not all, of American counties have some semblance of an Office of Aging to act as a portal to the panoply of programs designed for the aging American.&nbsp; But we're now at a new point in American history in which the promises made to all of the various layers and segments of our society are far outstripped by the resources available to meet them; the former Comptroller General under Presidents Bush and Clinton, David Walker, recently noted that <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/259476-ex-gao-head-us-debt-is-three-times-more-than-you-think" title="thehill.com">the actual federal debt is triple what is reported due to the unfunded liabilities</a> taken on by the government.&nbsp; These unfunded liabilities would include especially the promises made to the elder generation - Social Security - and Medicare.&nbsp; It is simply unsustainable.</p>
<p>While there are going to be increasing concerns and issues about the funding, the costs of providing care to an aging population continue to mount.&nbsp; These costs are not at an outrageously disproportionate rate like college tuition, but they are increasing slowly and steadily and having an impact upon the family.&nbsp; According to a report published by <a href="https://www.genworth.com/dam/Americas/US/PDFs/Consumer/corporate/130568_040115_gnw.pdf" title="genworth.com">Genworth Financial</a>, the median hourly rate for a homemaker service worker - who assists with non-medical and "hands-off" activities for the elderly and can help to maintain their independence - is $20 and the five year compounded rate of 1.61%.&nbsp; Note that this is for the most basic assistance available to an elderly person and has the lowest rate of cost growth.&nbsp; When you reach the higher levels of care, such as a semi-private nursing home room, the cost has risen over the past five years by a compounded rate of 3.57%.&nbsp; And that cost is not being borne solely by the elder and the governmental programs.&nbsp; A survey of more than 1400 households involved in caregiving for an elder found that fully 46% of those households were spending more than $5000 annually in their funds to assist their elders.&nbsp; So once again, costs are increasing and the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/684" title="www.practicaldad.com">sandwiched generation</a> is being pulled from yet another direction.&nbsp; Paul Krugman can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/opinion/despair-american-style.html?_r=0" title="nytimes.com">wax eloquently about existential American despair</a> in the op-ed pages of the Times, but this type of issue goes to the heart of the matter.&nbsp; The American middle class is beset not only by decreasing incomes on one side, but increasing costs and responsiblities on the other as more costs are offloaded back to them.&nbsp; This middle class generation was raised in a particular environment - employers with a set of benefits, a belief in the value of education, and an activist government - and they're watching it vanish as costs are shifted back to them and most importantly, their children.&nbsp; Healthcare benefits?&nbsp; Higher tuition?&nbsp; Jobs that enable their children to take their own place as productive adults?&nbsp; <em>Nope</em> to all of that.&nbsp; And when you consider that the writing is on the wall for future government spending, then there's really nothing existential about it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean going forward?&nbsp; An understanding that the old model of following the job and then monitoring the elders from a distance and managing via a cobbled-together network won't be as operative as it once was.&nbsp; State and local programs will be constrained and there's a greater likelihood that the facilities available to help care for invalided parents will be less than optimal and perhaps, households will shift to more of an integrated and intergenerational model with the elders close by to assist with the children and in turn be assisted by their children and growing grandchildren as they become increasingly infirm.&nbsp; My own perspective is also framed by an understanding that even if we don't realize it, our children are watching us and taking their lessons from our actions and inactions alike.&nbsp; That means that I try to model a more hands-on and involved approach with my own parent, even if the roles are increasingly reversed and frustrating in their own way.&nbsp; If we can't - and honestly shouldn't - look to government and the private sector to handle everything, then we have to be prepared to step in and manage ourselves as best as we are able.&nbsp; And if the parents are ultimately living longer, then the simple truth is that the men are going to have to move beyond their comfort zone and take on the additional burdens because their own mates are going to be similarly pressed; but if men can take on the kids - and we are most certainly able - then we can likewise take on the elders.</p>

 <title>...and a child shall lead them</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>Part of me believes that I should sit down with my son and watch the first half hour of the Democratic debate tonight.&nbsp; And then the other part of me remembers that the media (hint, CNN) is actively trying to get Biden to run and I realize that it's a complete circus freak show.&nbsp; Seriously, a week in advance and CNN is holding a debate podium for a guy who hadn't declared?</p>
<p>I think that I'll just wait for the Bad Lip Reading version and take bets on whether they give Hilary a man's voice.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -<em>comment on personal Facebook page on day of first Democratic debate</em></p>
<p>I posted the above comment on my Facebook page late this afternoon as an expression of the intense frustration with our present political gridlock.&nbsp; It's ingrained that my principal job as a parent is to prepare my kids to take their place as productive and moral adults in the great wide world and part and parcel of that preparation is exposure to Civics and the political process.&nbsp; Yet the frustration lies in the understanding that the political process is presently captive to the monied interests, much as it was during the days of the late 19th century Gilded Age.&nbsp; Top it off with the knowledge that the corporate media isn't just reporting the news but actively trying to massage it on both sides of the political spectrum - thank you, CNN and Fox - and I was sincere in my desire to blow off the entire thing in order to share a good action flick with Youngest, now in middle school.</p>
<p>With Mom out of town on business and his elder siblings off at college, he and I are doing the bachelor thing.&nbsp; We opted to watch a recently released action film but as we paused periodically for one thing or another - typically involving snacks and fridge raids - I commented on the debate, which was scheduled to air in another half hour.&nbsp; Understand that Youngest is living proof that the kids are capable of playing up, provided that you make it a habit of taking the time and effort to discuss the world and events with them.&nbsp; He's listened to conversation with his older siblings through the years and there have been instances when he's returned to me for clarification on whatever he's been privy to hear.&nbsp; Youngest has known for years who Bernie Sanders is because I made it a point to have him and one of his siblings listen to a short clip of Sanders' 2010 filibuster, made immortal by the common refrain <em>...and they can't afford diapers</em>; it wasn't a lengthy clip, but it did accompany an explanation of what a filibuster was and how rare it was anymore to actually hear one.&nbsp; After a short break, I thought that even if I was frustrated, I should at least give him the choice of what he wanted to watch and my frank expectation was that he'd opt for the film.&nbsp; It was a real surprise when he looked over at me from the sofa, took the lead and said <em>no offense, Dad, but I'd kind of like to see a bit of it.&nbsp; We can finish the film tomorrow.</em>&nbsp; It was an internally jarring moment as I realized that I was ditching my responsibility, one that I'd pursued regularly with his siblings, and that I was doing him a disservice.</p>
<p>At 8:29, we flipped off the movie and turned on the debate for the opening introduction through the question on gun control, at which time we turned off the television to start the bedtime routines.&nbsp; During that interval, he and I would take turns making comments - surprisingly serious and not the usual snark - and there were multiple instances in which I commented that I'd be coming back to a particular point.&nbsp; There are now multiple issues and comments written on a notepad in the kitchen for referral over the next several days and I'll make it a point to periodically visit those points in short conversations.&nbsp; And yes, the two predominant issues will be wealth/income inequality as well as gun control, those items covered in the first part that we watched.&nbsp; As time passes and more is discussed, we'll go into some of that as well.</p>
<p>So what's the takeaway as I sit here on the sofa, writing?&nbsp; The first, and probably most important, is that parenthood is a marathon instead of a sprint.&nbsp; As your family grows and then begins to move out into the world, it's easy to slack off a bit either because you think that you've got it all down pat or more importantly, just because you're tired.&nbsp; Trust me, teenagers can take it out of you and when you're onto teen #3, the wear on the tire can be a bit much.&nbsp; Tonight was a gentle smack in the figurative face that I was willing to forego what I absolutely wouldn't have ten years ago and that it was a disservice to a child who deserves as much as his older siblings.&nbsp; The second was the misconception that Youngest would be willing to skip the whole thing and stick to the movie instead of checking out the debate.&nbsp; It's a knock on his generation that they're tuned out and while I do subscribe to that in the main, tonight makes me wonder whether it's because they truly don't care or whether we simply don't give them the opportunity of playing up to adult issues.&nbsp; It certainly was almost the latter in Youngest's case tonight.&nbsp; My role as a father and parent is changing in terms of the two older kids, now off to college, but it hasn't changed with Youngest and it's something about which I'm going to have to remind myself.&nbsp; I will, however, have to also remind myself to not just rule out the current event conversations just because I don't think that they'll be interested.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - October 2015:&nbsp; Statistical Noise on the Fifth Anniversary</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The data has been collected and calculated for the PracticalDad Price Index in October 2015 and the result of this 60th monthly edition is a resounding example of minimal change and statistical noise.&nbsp; The Total Index for the 47 item marketbasket is 106.17 (November 2010 = 100) while the Food-Only Subindex of 37 foodstuff items declined from September's 107.17 to 107.07 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; The most notable change in the monthly occurred in the lunchmeat and deli cheese items (one pound prices for cooked deli ham and store brand American cheese, respectively).&nbsp; The price for each item rose by $1/pound at one of the three separate grocers to $4.99/pound apiece and was aided and abetted again by one of the other grocers not having the cheese on the shelves; this meant that the price increase for the one store had a larger impact on the average price of deli cheese due to the absence of the third.&nbsp; This type of occurrence in which one or another of the stores has an intermittent hiccup in the supply of one item has been noticeable, especially within the past year.&nbsp; In different months, I'll go in to price and find that one store of another simply doesn't have one of the sampled store-brand items on the shelf and in fact, doesn't even have a shelf tag to indicate that it's even in stock.&nbsp; If it's in one of the chain grocers, I'll swing by different locations to ascertain if it's purely a location issue and if not, I'll simply leave that item blank for that store with the result that the average price for the item is predicated upon two grocers instead of the standard three grocers.</p>
<p>So this is the fifth anniversary of a kitchen table project to ascertain what's really going on with food prices.&nbsp; I began the project in the late summer of 2010 because the Federal Reserve had engaged in a series of unprecedented policy manuevers - Quantitative Easing - that had the blogosphere humming with debate of whether this would radically impact prices or whether it wouldn't be able to offset the feared deflation arising from a near economic collapse in 2008.&nbsp; Many didn't trust the CPI issued by the government's Bureau of Labor Statistics and I figured that I could spew essentially meaningless bytes across the screen calling <em>bullshit</em> or I could put previous experience to use and provide a hopefully meaningful data point.&nbsp; You see, in the dark and distant past, I had an internship at the research department of a local chamber of commerce and was tasked in that summer to set up the local city for inclusion in the national chamber's cost-of-living index, measured periodically and compiled for cities across the country.&nbsp; It was grunt work contacting dozens of businesses to gain their input on an ongoing basis but it was at least educational as I also got to see how the mechanism worked.&nbsp; When the chamber hired me for further economic research after college (what is the impact of an avian influenza epidemic upon the county's poultry industry, you ask?), one of my corollary tasks was to continue with the collection of pricing and it was during this period that I was able to meet and work with the researchers who devised the survey for the national chamber.&nbsp; It's actually easy once you get it set up, provided that you go to the effort of being thoughtful in the creation of the instrument and follow up with consistency amongst the items priced and it was in the several month creation phase that various things were tried and eliminated.</p>
<p>So what have I learned in the past five years?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing that I've learned is that inflation is not an event with a single cause, but instead a process affected by a variety of often competing factors.&nbsp; The bloggers and pundits in 2008 were looking at the various QE programs with the idea that the vast amounts of money about to be pumped by the Federal Reserve and other central banks into the system would have a fully systemic effect - a <em>rising tide lifts all boats</em> impact.&nbsp; There was an opinion, which I shared, that we would go the way of the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitext/ess_germanhyperinflation.html" title="George Goodman/&quot;Adam Smith&quot;">German Weimar Republic</a> and end up with a hyperinflation that destroyed the currency.&nbsp; But prices were actually affected by a wide variety of factors.&nbsp;  The Food-Only Subindex - consisting of 37 separate foodstuff items in bread/meat/dairy/produce/staples groups - rose from the baseline of 100 in November 2010 to a peak of 115.13 in December 2014.&nbsp; While this increase was neither linear nor constant, it did rise as items were affected by different factors.</p>
<p>These factors included such things as simple supply and demand, as exogenous events such as <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/733" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Yes, Dairy and Meat Prices are Increasing">drought</a> or <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/736" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Egging on Inflation">disease</a> affected the price of one or more of the particular items in the basket.&nbsp; One of the earliest factors captured in the index in the first year was the impact of hot money flows into commodities.&nbsp; As money from the first QE program began to flow into the financial sector, the wizards of Wall Street promptly began to divert some of that into commodities with the thought that these raw materials had greater value than money itself because it was actually physical so <em>hey, it's gotta be good because there's something actually there</em>.&nbsp; Among the commodities were <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/367" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Index Rises to 100.78">aluminum</a>, <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/584" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Sugar Completes the Stealth Rise">sugar</a> and <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/427" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Coffee Keeps Perking Along">coffee</a>.&nbsp; The run-up in oil prices around 2012 and 2013 led to a corresponding significant rise in the grocery store as various forms of cooking oil - which had sources that also served as biofuel sources - rose significantly, albeit lagging the rise in oil prices.&nbsp; The oil rise was a function of both <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/427" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Coffee Keeps Perking Along">hot money commodity flows</a> and <a href="http://practicaldad.com/index.php/article/414" title="PracticalDad:  Economic Webs">foreign political factors</a>.</p>
<p>I've also learned that while prices can go down again, as it did for items such as canola oil and coffee (although not as low as it was beforehand), stealth inflation packaging is a great way for producers and grocers to gain a little bit more profit margin on their goods.&nbsp; From what I've seen, it's a great way to ensure a little extra profit margin as nominal prices go down on the newly repackaged item but not enough on a per ounce basis to make it truly cheaper.&nbsp; It also resets the scale as it were, so that there's a new baseline price upon which they can act in the future and over time, people will lose sight of how much the original price actually was.</p>
<p>But these factors are truly only temporary factors that can be remedied - and largely have been - with a change in situation.&nbsp; As the QE programs ended, the hot money flows have diminished significantly and the supply issues will ameliorate over time as either supplies again increase or demand is shifted away and to other items so that there's a new equilibrium reached.&nbsp; In each of the commodities already listed - sugar, aluminum foil, coffee and cooking oil - the prices have either stabilized or again dropped, although not to the original level because prices never drop as readily as they increase (thank you, grocers and producers).</p>
<p>So the Food-Only Subindex rose over four years from a baseline of 100 in November 2010 to a high point of 115.13 in December, 2014 and it was this period that demonstrated the effect of the various factors as they overtook the effects of the deflation so feared by the Federal Reserve and other assorted central banks.&nbsp; But it was in the ten month period from January to October 2015 that deflation took the reins from the other factors as the Food-Only Subindex literally collapsed from December's 115.13 to this month's level of 106.17 - <em>a drop of 53% in a period of time only a fifth of that through which the index rose</em>.&nbsp; Despite the best efforts of the Federal Reserve to move prices upwards, it was in this ten month period that the deflation that it so feared came through as the effects of lower incomes and increased food stamp usage finally surged through the mass economy.&nbsp; Grocers aren't stupid.&nbsp; They live with a thin profit margin and as a result are sensitive to their customers' needs, wants and especially circumstances.&nbsp; It's been in these past ten months that another process, more violent, as surged through as the grocers have found new suppliers willing and able to provide lower-priced alternatives to their clientele.&nbsp; The Great Depression taught that in a deflationary environment, few businesses survive and the three grocers have each gone to lengths to fight one another - and Walmart - for market share, rolling out new pricing strategies as well as simply finding new suppliers to provide the lowest cost alternatives for the customers.&nbsp; Yes, other prices are increasing such as rent, health care and tuition.&nbsp; But when looked at on a market basket basis, it's the grocery where prices have crashed.</p>
<p>People often learn best when presented with an illustrative point or analogy and it's here that I've struggled for some while to find the right one to drive the point home.&nbsp; Until this past weekend when I went camping with Youngest's scout troop and came down to the kitchen area early one morning for a coffee to kickstart the day.&nbsp; As I sipped the scalding black coffee, I looked at the scoutmaster's camp stove and noted a pot with a lid to heat up hot water.&nbsp; But what was different about this pot was that there was a built-in spigot that extended from the bottom and allowed a person to dispense hot water without having to remove the lid or worry about ladles and it was this pot that struck me as the best example of the interplay amongst inflationary and deflationary factors.&nbsp; Think of the economy and prices in the most general terms as a pot on a stove and prices as the level of the heated water within the pot.&nbsp; Economic activity is moved by transactions much as water is heated by a source and as the economic activity increases, it heats the economy and prices will generally rise much as the water level in a heated pot will rise when the lid is on.&nbsp; That's the view that's been taken by the economists and it's to this end that all actions have been taken.&nbsp; Prices have risen due to some of the factors that we've discussed before, the level bubbling due to supply shortages and hot money flows and for all of the effort, the pot really does appear to be active and hot.&nbsp; But if you keep the heat on the pot yet use the spigot to remove water from the pot for a cup of instant coffee or oatmeal, the water within will continue to boil and bubble and yet the water level will drop despite the heat and this is the deflationary effect.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what occurs with the other factors.&nbsp; Prices for individual items can rise like a bubble, but on a cumulative basis, the price level will drop as the incomes - the water - drain away.&nbsp; Customers can and will alter their buying habits, replacing steak with inferior goods or simply doing without and the grocers and producers will have to do whatever they can in order to continue to make sales.&nbsp; And when they can do no more, they'll simply go out of business like their predecessors in the Great Depression.</p>
<p>So what will be the outcome of this thus-far eight year trip down the monetary rabbit hole?&nbsp; Will there be hyperinflation that destroys the currency or will deflation win out?&nbsp; The sad reality is that nobody really knows now since the central banks took actions that literally destroyed the metrics that were used to understand what was happening around us.&nbsp; This isn't a national pricing project as several respected financial/economics bloggers have correctly pointed out and I'm not about to pretend that it is; but I do believe that it can and does serve as a reliable datapoint for those who are interested.&nbsp; And if you're interested in doing this to satisfy your own curiosity, just be sure to be consistent in the marketbasket over time.&nbsp; But even if you don't go this far, make it a point to pay greater attention to what you're seeing in the stores and on the streets, because it's our own inattention that has helped this monetary nonsense flourish.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>The Kids Are Paying Attention</title>
 <content:encoded><p>You're wrong if you think that the kids aren't paying attention, because they are.&nbsp; It's something I've realized for a long time and last week was another example as Youngest related what he'd heard standing in line at a used gaming store.&nbsp; His older siblings have periodically surprised me with what they've heard and realized through the years and yesterday was Youngest's turn.&nbsp; He was standing in line to purchase a game while I browsed some feet away, and there was a young father and mother with a toddler in a stroller ahead of him.&nbsp; The parents were purchasing a Destiny PS4 system expansion pack and immediately after he turned from the counter with his box in a bag, the father immediately returned to the cashier and asked if he could get a second bag - preferably gray or dark colored - into which he could put the bagged expansion pack.&nbsp; The father commented that they were returning home downtown - approximately five miles away - and didn't want to run the risk of being mugged in their neighborhood.&nbsp; Youngest watched as the clerk obliged and double-bagged the purchase, then watched further as the young family exited out the door and through the parking lot to the highway, upon which he then moved up for his own purchase.</p>
<p>It was as we were walking to our own vehicle that Youngest mentioned the overheard conversation with the opening statement <em>man, I feel terrible...</em> followed by his description of what he'd witnessed.&nbsp; From that point onwards for the next ten minutes or so, the conversation ranged over a variety of topics that emanated from his observations.&nbsp; First, the notion that the family might have actually walked about five miles, carrying a bag and pushing a toddler in a stroller and that if you didn't have some form of reliable transportation in American society, your options were limited at best.&nbsp; He's already witnessed friends of his elder siblings who were occasionally jammed because of this vehicle situation and this instance just served to reinforce that it not only affected individuals but could also affect families with children as well.&nbsp; Second was the comment about spending priorities; if you couldn't afford a reliable vehicle, should you really be spending what little disposable income you have on a game expansion pack and especially if it's obviously for yourself instead of for your toddler?&nbsp; The third was the simple comment <em>I'd hate to find myself in that situation</em> with my agreement that both Mom and I were working hard to assure both that he wasn't in that predicament at present and that he had the skills and judgment to assure that he wouldn't find himself there in the future.</p>
<p>This morning's conversation in the car to school was another situation that he witnessed and after offering my input, I noted to him that part and parcel of my job as a father was to help him take all of these experiences and knit them together into a recognizable form that provided context for his life.&nbsp; It is our job as parents to do precisely that and especially if we're making a purposeful effort to not shield them from the world as some parents do; we must listen to what they say and use that as a departure point for as many permutations as time and attention will allow.&nbsp; It is this constant effort at conversation and context that will help them establish a sense of not just right and wrong, but also a context of what is appropriate versus simply acceptable versus the worst case, aberrant.&nbsp; This is not a one-off event but instead a constant, persistent process that will take years and if we handle it properly, will come back to us as we ourselves age and the adult children can help provide context for us in a changing society.</p>

 <title>Craigslist Chic</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Society changes as the younger generation rises to take its place and begins to supplant the dying-off elders.&nbsp; It always happens and now is no different from when the Boomers supplanted the Silent Generation.&nbsp; But we now have a problem since our economy is predicated upon consumption and yet incomes are declining and the demands upon the family budgets are growing.&nbsp;So how is that change occurring?&nbsp; Watching Eldest and one of her peers, who I've had the privilege of knowing since that young woman was in early elementary school, is both educational and reflective of what's occurring in the broader society.&nbsp; It can best be described as what I refer to as <em>Craigslist Chic</em>.</p>
<p>With the news that family median income has again <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-16/record-467-million-americans-live-poverty-median-houshold-income-back-1989-levels" title="zerohedge.com">dropped to levels not seen since 1989 and poverty rising to new levels</a>, it's a new world for those who grew up expecting a particular lifestyle and finding that it's simply unattainable.&nbsp; There's been an expectation of a newer house in the suburbs with newer automobiles, late model appliances and in a nod to this new generation, an array of interconnected devices that increasingly make up what is referred to as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/11/the-rise-of-the-sensornet-4-9bn-connected-things-in-2015-says-gartner/" title="techcrunch.com">the sensornet</a>.&nbsp; And advertising continues to push this drive to have as much as it ever has, promoting the image and the goods with unabashed enthusiasm.&nbsp; There's obviously a gap growing here between the desire for the things and the ability to afford said things and the rise of Craigslist is one of that ways that people are managing to bridge that gap.</p>
<p>The site began two decades ago and in its earlier days, had a touch of the wild west aspect to it with news blurbs coming across about the occasional individual who was trying to sell a kidney or engaging in some odd and unsavory transaction.&nbsp; As full disclosure, I managed to go for years without viewing Craigslist and only began to seriously view it after Eldest began perusing it on a routine basis.&nbsp; The situation was now reversed because in their much younger years, I routinely monitored <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/102" title="practicaldad.com:  Keeping Tabs on the Culture/Music">electronics and the media</a> ahead of them and when the kids were truly young, I would periodically watch bits and pieces of MTV and BET to see what was happening with the culture.&nbsp;  At twenty years old, Craigslist is now a veritable institution on the web and as I watch, it's become one of the key ways that the youngsters are bridging that gap so that they can far more affordably attain what's been trotted out over the years by the consumer machine.</p>
<p>It has been fascinating to watch Eldest, who has the goal of her own place yet has grasped that the old ways of just walking in and furnishing a house or apartment en masse is no longer realistically operative.&nbsp; She approaches the goal as a puzzle with the parameters of currently available funds, wants and available prospects via Craigslist; she is assured of safe storage because we're already holding furniture left by other family members for when the kids are on their own.&nbsp; I've watched her spend free time quietly perusing Craigslist with the occasional comment to her mother about how she likes this or that particular item and on a few occasions now, I've gotten the word that she's gone to a particular place in order to look at one thing or another and sure enough, a piece of furniture winds up in my garage for safe disposition until its time is come for use.&nbsp; In the case of the other young woman, my <em>might-as-well-be</em> niece, she furnished her first apartment via an assortment of means.&nbsp; Utilitarian furniture came from her parents' house to supplement what little she'd already accumulated, she purchased from highly discounted furniture stores and found to her surprise that she could purchase a like-new set on Craigslist for a fraction of what she'd seen the same set in a retail furniture store.&nbsp; The site has become almost ubiquitous and the ability of consumers to connect with one another and transact goods outside of the traditional retail will only place even greater stress upon the traditional bricks-and-mortar economy, already stressed by the rise of online retailing.</p>
<p>The other aspect of Craigslist is its inherent teachable lessons in human nature, and this is where the youngsters might need some input from their elders.&nbsp; It's a truism amongst any retailer, either brick/mortar or online, that the customer is always right and almost all businesses at least make an attempt to honor that.&nbsp; But Craigslist allows the person to interact with any kind of person and that goes partcularly to ethics - moral, immoral or simply amoral.&nbsp; In my few instances of Craigslist usage, I've run into two instances of ethical lapses; the first was a misrepresentation about circumstances as a young adult trying to make a buck as a used car dealer misrepresented himself in a potential car sale while the second jacked the price of an item when he realized that he'd been dealing with my wife and I didn't have a hard copy of what they'd discussed.&nbsp; In the first instance, a young adult was with me and we walked on the transaction and in the second, I wound up paying an additional $30 on the deal that I didn't realize the issue until I was almost home.&nbsp; This doesn't mean that all Craigslist sellers are dubious, because they aren't.&nbsp; But it does mean that if you know that your youngster is actually thinking of using it, it would be helpful to offer your assistance as they move forward and I suspect in most instances, they'd be willing to accept the input.&nbsp; At the minimum, talk to them about some simple safety rules:&nbsp; first and foremost, if you're going to meet someone, make sure that someone close to you knows the physical details of the meeting - time, location and the identity of the seller, even if just the Craigslist identifier - and more preferable would be having someone come along with you.&nbsp; Second, meetings when possible should be at public locations and if for any reason your internal alarm system is triggered - <em>y'know, I'm a bit uncomfortable with this</em> - find a reason to simply decline the potential transaction and get out of there.&nbsp; Third would be to assure that you have a record of all communications - digital or hard-copy - to avoid the prospect of any <em>he said/she said</em> scenarios that might spiral out of control.&nbsp; Beyond that simple threesome, you can discuss whatever other aspects you wish.</p>
<p>Having been around for two decades - an eon in digital terms - Craigslist and it's peers aren't going anywhere.&nbsp; It serves a purpose and that will only increase as the youngsters use it more and more to help them bridge the gap between economic reality and the images of adulthood that they've been sold throughout their youth by the consumption machine.&nbsp; But if you become aware that the kids are using it, feel free to offer your perspective because you have the experience factor that they haven't yet acquired.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - September 2015:&nbsp; Stabilizing, but&#8230;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The data from the September 2015 PracticalDad Price Index is in and the price declines of the past nine months have ceased and stabilized, for now at least.&nbsp; But I've been noticing something and it's gotten me to thinking about the earliest stages of what's happening with wealth inequality and how it might be starting to affect the grocery store.</p>
<p>In terms of the actual Index results, both the Total Index (47 total market basket items) and the Food-Only Sub-Index (the 37 foodstuff items in that basket) stabilized with the Total Index rising incrementally to 105.21 (November 2010 = 100) from August's Total Index reading of 104.96.&nbsp; The Food-Only Sub-Index likewise rose slightly to 107.12 in September (November 2010 = 100) from August's result of 106.97.&nbsp; </p>
<p>But what have I been noticing in the past number of months and what has this to do with income inequality?&nbsp; Let's take a quick look at income and wealth inequality first.&nbsp; The disparity between the highest levels and the remainder of American society have been noted in several ways.&nbsp; Obviously, <a href="http://inequality.org/wealth-inequality/" title="inequality.org">the percentage of assets held by the top 3% of families has reached large proportions</a> as the remaining 97% of American families have fewer and fewer assets available to them.&nbsp; The lack of retirement savings has led to a situation in which middle-aged and older Americans <a href="http://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2015/the-employment-situation-march-2015.pdf" title="aarp.org">have a lower unemployment rate than other age groups</a>.&nbsp; As income and wealth have bifurcated - split - this has likewise been noted in the prices of different markets of items.&nbsp; While the BLS reports that CPI and wholesale prices are largely static, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304585004579415110604829016" title="wsj.com">there's been greater price inflation in products oriented towards wealthy buyers</a>.&nbsp; The price of truly high-end luxury automobiles has risen as has the price of collectible artwork as the ultra-wealthy look for new assets in which to place their money.&nbsp; The point to take away from this is that there's a notable split between the economics for the average American versus the wealthier American.</p>
<p>So how does that impact the daily shopping in the grocery store?&nbsp; What I'm noticing over the months leads to this question:&nbsp; <em>is the product mix on the store shelves beginning to disproportionately affect the lower-income level consumers as their best alternatives for products are either removed completely or replaced with lower-quality products as grocers rework their product mix in order to survive?</em></p>
<p>The key point to remember about grocery retail is that it's a business with extremely low profit margins and that with a limited amount of shelf and freezer space, products have to have a sufficient amount of profit or they'll be removed and replaced with an item that's more profitable.&nbsp; Grocers do pay attention to this metric and are constantly re-evaluating their product mix in order to maximize their own bottom-line.&nbsp; What I've noticed is that the grocers are slowly - and thus far on a small scale - removing items from the shelves that are better for customers but worse for their bottom line.&nbsp; It began over a year ago when one of the grocers - an independent - simply removed the two baby-related items (23.4 ounce Enfamil formula and a store-brand case of size 3 diapers) from their shelves entirely.&nbsp; That formula is no longer sold as the selection was thinned out and the store brand cases of diapers were eliminated.&nbsp; Parents with children could still purchase the size 3 store brand diapers, but in the smaller packaging with a higher per-diaper cost.&nbsp; About three months ago, the second of the three retailers likewise removed their case of size 3 store brand diapers from all of their stores - I checked multiple locations in that chain each month - so that that option was no longer available for the family with small children.&nbsp; Again, the smaller packaging was available, but it's more expensive on a per-diaper basis.</p>
<p>Another instance pertains to the sale of 80% lean ground beef.&nbsp; Over the past several months, one of the grocers - which has also removed the case of store-brand diapers from the shelves - has eliminated 80% lean ground beef from its meat case; it still sells the leaner ground beef at various percentages (85 and 93) as well as the less expensive 73% that is sold in a tube.&nbsp; Please note that this same 73% ground beef tube is sold in all of the stores.&nbsp; Given that the markup is progressively higher for each lean/fat category as it increases, the grocer is implicitly stating that the low cost mass produced 73% lean container will be available for the low-end market but that the profit mix is best served by eliminating the 80% and pushing the higher end, more profitable ground meats.&nbsp; We've become used to the sales pitch that leaner meat is better and more will hopefully - for the grocer - purchase the less-fat ground beefs; what's interesting was that in researching this article, I found that the yield of actual cooked meat was <a href="http://www.hillbillyhousewife.com/reducedfatgroundbeef.htm" title="hillbillyhousewife.com">most cost-effective for the 73% lean</a> than the higher leans since a pound of 73% lean after cooking left 11 ounces of meat while the far more expensive 93% lean left only 12.75 ounces of meat after cooking.&nbsp; The lost weight was due to fat that was able to be drained away.&nbsp; In this particular instance, it might be a mixed blessing for the lower-echelon consumer if he is willing to be serious about draining the fat from the cooking.</p>
<p>There's early initial evidence that the same issue is occurring with both hot dogs and tuna as well.&nbsp; One grocer has eliminated the store-brand hot dog in entirety while I'm noticing that another grocer is starting to not carry store-brand tuna; I'll be checking the various locations for that grocer in the next several months to verify whether that is or isn't the situation.</p>
<p>This is assuredly a small sample on a local level and I'm not going to fight to show that it may or may not be occurring nationally.&nbsp; But it is indeed occurring here and my concern is that if it continues, what is starting on a very small scale will accumulate to more and more products that are, on the whole, detrimental to the family trying to make the monthly budget work.</p>
<p>And because a full update hasn't been shown in several months, here is the listing of Total and Food-Only Index results going back to December 2014.</p>

 <title>College Education and &#8220;Skin in the Game&#8221;</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>I think that the kids need to have some skin in the game...</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Tech Guy and Father to the PracticalDad</em></p>

<p>This comment was made to me several days ago, just a day after both Middle and another posted a video about Bernie Sanders proposing free college tuition for all Americans.&nbsp;  Taped in a conference room at his Burlington, Vermont campaign headquarters, candidate Sanders restates the issue - higher education is unaffordable to hundreds of thousands of young Americans - and follows with both a plan and a plea.&nbsp; Since I'm unable to find this video outside of Facebook, I'm providing a link to a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer in which the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IxEl8L__OA" title="youtube.com/CNN">same proposal is discussed</a>.&nbsp; Please understand that you have to get through a short segment on Hillary Clinton as a setup for the interview.</p>
<p>As full disclosure, I like Bernie Sanders even though I'm nowhere near a socialist in my leanings.&nbsp; When he gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLNKNq9soLE" title="youtube.com">a filibuster</a> in late 2010, I made it a point to have the kids watch - even if only for a few minutes - so that they could see a filibuster in action and his name has come up in later discussions with the kids.&nbsp; The problem is painfully and correctly obvious.&nbsp; We've allowed a system to be created that predicates supposed achievement and financial security upon the acquisition of a degree that can cripple a young adult's prospects for more than a few years and the cumulative level of student debt now surpasses the national level of credit card debt.&nbsp; The mantra in the PracticalDad household for the past eight years has been <em>we need to get you through college with as little debt as humanly possible</em> and Eldest is almost at that point now.&nbsp; So how do we make this happen for the millions of other young Americans?</p>
<p>What Sanders proposes is a popular two-fer, free tuition for all young Americans to be funded by a transaction tax upon each stock trade made on all equity markets across the country.&nbsp; Get the youngsters excited while simultaneously sticking it to Wall Street.&nbsp; The transaction tax specifically is a $.50 fee made upon each market transaction by <em>all</em> entities that trade in the exchanges and is what is referred to generically as a <em>Tobin Tax</em>, in honor of the man who first proposed the concept several years ago.&nbsp; It is partially based upon the number of shares in any particular transaction, so a hedge fund moving 100,000 shares of a company would pay the tax while Joe Six-pack moving 100 shares of the same company in his own transaction would not.&nbsp; The fees would be aggregated and then used to fund the tuition for any college student in the country, at any public school.</p>
<p>But here's where the Tobin Tax concept becomes interesting.&nbsp; The equity markets have reached the point at which more than 2/3 of all transactions are now done via HFT - High Frequency Trading - aka what is now nicknamed <em>Skynet</em>.&nbsp; In other words, high speed algorhythmic programs running out of the TBTF banks and hedge funds across what is considered Wall Street.&nbsp; The key idea behind the original concept was to somehow curb the amount of HFT trading so that that small group of investors would no longer have an outsized advantage on the rest of the public; by the time that Joe Six-pack can place a single sell order, an algorhythmic HFT program can execute dozens for a distinct advantage.&nbsp; HFT wouldn't be outlawed but it would be curbed.&nbsp; The potential tax revenue on this would, by estimate of 2008 transactional data for all forms of financial instrument trades - stocks, bonds, swaps, etc - amount to <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/ftt-revenue-2009-12.pdf" title="cepr.org">greater than $300 Billion</a> and even if the result of the transaction tax is a 50% reduction in the number of trades, the proceeds would approximate $175 Billion.&nbsp; And that's with a five year old report based upon trade data from 2008.&nbsp; As angry as Main Street has become with Wall Street's predation and apparent control of the levers of political power via campaign contributions, Sanders' proposal has the potential for some serious popular legs.</p>
<p>But after thinking about the proposal, I have two issues with it and neither pertains to the Tobin Tax, but instead the notion of free tuition itself.&nbsp; The first concern is more pragmatic - what's the point of paying for every young American's tuition if there's no real, sustainable-living wage job available for him or her upon completion?&nbsp; It's a lovely notion that Junior can achieve a more affordable education but at the end of the day, the point of higher education is ultimately to prepare people to take their places as productive members of society.&nbsp; It's hard to be productive if there isn't enough economic activity to support said jobs and the end result is that the youngsters continually return to gather even more credits because there's nothing else to do.&nbsp; Taken to it's logical conclusion, the program eventually costs even more because the kids just go to school instead of being gainfully employed.&nbsp; Without sustainable, living-wage jobs for them, this is akin to nothing more than refueling airplanes so that they can maintain holding patterns instead of being able to land and letting the passengers get on with their lives.&nbsp; Sanders is correct in that he makes this a concrete proposal as part of a larger package of actions that have to occur.</p>
<p>The other issue is more philosophic.&nbsp; Should we put together and sponsor a package in which something such as the tuition for higher education is free or should we, as a society, make the statement that it has sufficient value that the student and/or family should still put something towards it?&nbsp; In other words, assure that the student has some <em>skin in the game</em>, as the other father stated to me later.&nbsp; I believe that it's human nature that we have more appreciation for that in which we've had a personal stake.&nbsp; How many of us parents have seen kids take greater care of those items where there's a personal investment?&nbsp; If you want to make it a sliding scale tuition based upon income, then so be it; but society can still absorb sufficient of the cost that the amount owed isn't punitive or exhausting to the payer.&nbsp; Part and parcel of the philosophy piece - dark as it is - is the notion that <em>there is no such thing as a free lunch (TINSTAAFL).</em>&nbsp; Even if there's no ticketed monetary cost to be paid, there exists the prospect that the price will be paid in other forms and in this case, the prospect of some form of compulsory national service via a re-institution of the military draft and/or form of civilian service.&nbsp; It's an old idea that has been kicked around first by one side and then another but as funds go to one particular group and others believe their ox to be gored, the resultant clamor could result in such a deal being reached.&nbsp; <em>Hey, the kids are getting free tuition and money's tight elsewhere...why not let them pay it back another way?</em>&nbsp; Some can disagree that it might ever happen and some can disagree that it's a bad thing, but the prospect exists and it needs to be out there before any final decision is reached.</p>
<p>The issue might seem insurmountable given the barrage of commentary from one side and another amidst a 24/7 newscycle.&nbsp; But it's good to remember that our country has made such statements about the value of public higher education before and each in times more troubled than these.&nbsp; The great land-grant universities - Berkeley, Purdue, Penn State and the like - arose out of legislation passed during the Civil War and the GI Bill arose out of the ashes of the Second World War.&nbsp; And these were far greater fights than what would be faced with the Wall Street crowd.</p>

 <title>Managing the Transition to Adulthood</title>
 <content:encoded><p>You might not think about it now, but that child that you tuck in each night will at some point reach adulthood, or at least some semblance of it given the present economic circumstances.&nbsp; Just as we should never have gotten into Iraq without some serious consideration about the endgame, parents should begin to consider their own endgame with the kids, i.e. phasing out their own responsibilities and passing them along to the nascent adults.&nbsp; It's a question that my wife are only now starting to consider with the Eldest of our three children, who is now entering her senior year in college and is legally able to drink.&nbsp; How should the parents phase out their present responsibilities?</p>
<p>It's not like it used to be where the kids left home after graduation - high school or college - and got a job that permitted them to become financially independent adults.&nbsp; The jobs environment of the decades through the 1990s is no longer operative as the one-person-full-time-with-benefits job model has been replaced with the multiple-part-time-no-benefits job model; what some have begun referring to as <em><a href="http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/7/71/915334/robert-reich-american-workers-call" title="the gig economy">the gig economy</a></em>.&nbsp; This move towards a newer, more uncertain way to make a living exacerbates what has become a debate on <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/590" title="Practicaldad.com:  Is an 18 year old an adult?">when adulthood actually begins</a>.&nbsp; The consumption model of the economy is predicated upon the formation of households to sell all of the wonderful stuff that makes a house a well-furnished house (not a home, just a well-furnished house unless you put in the effort and time) and when the young people cannot afford or are unwilling to make those decisions - moving out, marriage, parenthood - then the result is a slowdown in the economic driver as those milestones are, at best, delayed.&nbsp; Toss in the albatross necklace of student debt and there's a true impediment to economic growth.&nbsp; The result is that there a fair number of middle-aged parents who are doing what they can to help their nascent adult offspring; the question that you should consider while you still have time is to what extent you wish to go?</p>
<p>When I survey the panoply of <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/246" title="PracticalDad:  When Opie Comes to Play">Opies</a> that I've come to know through the older two kids, Eldest and Middle, there's a massive disparity between what different parents will do for the kids.&nbsp; At the one end of the spectrum are the sets of parents who actually expect the kids to help with paying the multiple household bills that come in, including mortgage and utilities.&nbsp; The thought process seems to be <em>congratulations, you're now an adult and despite only having a part-time job, we expect you to chip in as a full-fledged adult</em>.&nbsp; The fact that Junior might only be a high school graduate or have outstanding student debt overhanging him is irrelevant to the situation.&nbsp; The kid - adult? - is expected to contribute even if it means that he's further handicapped and prohibited from getting out on his own because of this requirement.&nbsp; While it is unscientific, my observation seems to be that these cases are predominantly amongst parents who are best described as working class or blue collar and could likely be under financial stress as well.&nbsp; In one particular case, the young adult has been told for years that once he reached the age of 18, he'd be responsible for his own food, clothing, transportation and would have to pay rent as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other end of the spectrum are those who not only stand responsible for educating the kids, but are also willing to provide financial cover for as long as legally practicable.&nbsp; I know of multiple sets of parents who are keeping the kids on their employer-provided health insurance even after they're graduated from college.&nbsp; One close friend even researched the regulations and found that her chemical engineer son could stay on her insurance until the age of 25, even if he was well-employed with a plan that he could purchase through his own employer.&nbsp; Since this young man has graduated from college and graduate school with a considerable amount of student debt - he once commented <em>I'm in so much debt that I could start a government</em> - every little bit that he can throw at the debt to work it down is worthwhile and their family understanding is that cover will be provided so long as the money goes to pay off the debt.&nbsp; It's ditto for the auto insurance and the caveat is that he and his siblings will stay on the auto policy until they can truly take on their own or they screw up and cause the premium to rise.&nbsp; This also brings up the other aspect which is that of responsibility; if the parents think that the kid is responsible enough to appreciate the privilege that's being afforded by the parents and is actually appreciative of it.&nbsp; If the kid is technically an adult but the privilege afforded actually prevents him from learning by shielding from poor consequences, then nobody would think poorly of any parent that threw in the financial towel and said <em>to hell with it</em>.</p>
<p>So think about it and start to determine where you are.&nbsp; It's a multi-dimensional question with parameters of age - kid and parent - as well as breadth - just financial or extending to other areas - and personal philosophy.&nbsp; But understand that it's a question worthy of consideration as the present economic climate continues to warp and torque what was once conventional wisdom and practice about life and adulthood.</p> </content:encoded>

 <title>The Value of a Car&#8230;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>If there's anything that's become apparent in the past month, it's the necessity for having a vehicle in order to hold a job.&nbsp; There's always public transportation if both your home and job are near a route, but it's highly possible that either one or the other won't be near one and in that case, a car is vital for a livelihood.&nbsp; Such was the lesson when multiple vehicles in the PracticalDad household simultaneously opted for a sit-down strike, creating mayhem in the otherwise smoothly flowing schedule.</p>
<p>This is a family that has lived with a vehicle philosophy:&nbsp; buy newer used and run them until the wheels drop off and by that, I literally mean that.&nbsp; Except for my wife's Toyota - now at 11 years of age and more than 180000 miles - we've always driven used and four of the cars throughout our 28 year marriage have been towed away for salvage.&nbsp; Some have died quietly, with a whimper or a simple <em>passed away in its sleep overnight</em> and one went with a violent fit, tossing a piston through the engine while running at 60 miles per hour on a four lane highway.&nbsp; The point is that we drive them until they simply won't be driven ever again.&nbsp; Until recently, the stats on the four vehicles were that the youngest was my wife's, at eleven years of age although that was also the highest mileage, followed by my rolling dumpster with 151000 miles.&nbsp; Each of the older kids had their own beater, one a hand-me-down from Grandmother when she gave up her license, and each needed it since both worked two summer jobs to beef up the bank account for the school year.&nbsp; We also know kids who have had to borrow one or another of our own in order to get back and forth to jobs because of their own want of a vehicle.</p>
<p>But the past month was a figurative wreck as first one car - Eldest's - went down with what appeared to be terminal issues, followed by my own.&nbsp; This left us with a math problem:&nbsp; two vehicles split amongst four drivers, one of whom requires a fully functioning automobile and another two that have to make it to another four separate jobs between them, each job working a different shift each day.&nbsp; The ten point question is this:&nbsp; how do you make this work?&nbsp; Given that Youngest also had his own set of activities and I run the household, the only way to conceivably make it work was to revert back to earlier years when Dad literally ran a taxi service.&nbsp; If one of the working kids had a late shift and no one required use of a vehicle, then that kid drove to work; otherwise, it was once again <em>Dad's Taxi</em> and it wasn't uncommon for me to toting and hauling on a midnight run to a job.&nbsp; It was the first of a series of lessons for the kids - the need for many of the working poor to have a vehicle in order to even have a shot at holding a job at all.</p>
<p>So apart from that realization, what other lessons came from the experience?&nbsp; First was whether it was even an option to even repair it and Eldest already had done a visit to <a href="http://www.kbb.com" title="kbb.com">Kelly Blue Book</a> to ascertain the value of her vehicle.&nbsp; The second lesson was the value of a good mechanic.&nbsp; Since I was out of town that week, she and my wife had it towed to a shop that's done some of our repairs in the past but with which I've become increasingly concerned over the past year.&nbsp; When they reported that her car had a cracked head gasket with repairs at a cost of $2700 - outstripping the car's value of $2200 - I had it towed to another garage for a second opinion, recalling last Autumn's <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/732" title="Conversations with the Kids:  Corporate versus Local">out of state car repair event</a> when the repair cost was significantly less than originally anticipated.&nbsp; In this case, the second garage fixed Eldest's car for less than $60; which was also the third lesson, the value of a second opinion.&nbsp; Throughout the process, conversations with the kids about the progress continued so that they knew what was happening as it occurred.&nbsp; The point was to not only keep the costs down and the vehicles running, but also to teach them so that they would have an idea of what to do should this happen to them in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final lesson was about how to purchase a new vehicle and surprisingly, it was Youngest who came along for those sessions since his elder siblings were working.&nbsp; While my van was likewise repairable, the risk of running old vehicles made it apparent that we still needed a more reliable car and since she deserves it, it would go to my wife.&nbsp; Youngest sat in on the sessions with the sales reps but all heard the questions and commentaries to my wife - what do you really need and what do you really want?&nbsp; Once the parameters were established, it was a question of finding what worked and most cost-effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we now have a new 2015 to complement the others.&nbsp; Both mine and Eldest's were repairable and are in use, although mine is now used solely for hauling equipment, debris and yard waste.&nbsp; It's a little more for the insurance but it's still cheaper than ruining one of the other vehicle's interiors or renting a pickup truck.&nbsp; The final point is this:&nbsp; these experiences and decisions are all part and parcel of adulthood and it's better to teach the lessons yourself when they're available than just expecting that the kids will figure it out when they're older.&nbsp; If situations arise, identify them to the kids and talk through the process with them, engage them whenever possible and share the results with them.&nbsp; For these everyday adult occurrences, no young adult should ever have to look back and say <em>I wish someone had told me before.</em></p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - August 2015 / Total Index Collapse</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>PracticalDad note:&nbsp; This is an abbreviated update for the August 2015 Price Index.&nbsp; The summer has been busy and full and writing has been curtailed because of, well...life.&nbsp; That said, the pricing for the August edition of the PracticalDad Price Index did occur at the first of the month and this is the abbreviated version; more will be coming on this when things gear up again in another week.</em></p>
<p>The PracticalDad Price Index resumed it's decline, which has occurred almost uninterrupted since reaching the peak in late 2014 and early 2015.&nbsp; What is most notable is that the Total Index (covering the cost of 47 grocery store items priced in three unrelated grocery stores with November 2010 = 100) dropped significantly by 1.34 basis points from July's reading of 106.30 to August's level of 104.96.&nbsp; The Food-Only Index of the 37 Foodstuff items from the basket also declined in the month, although not as precipitously; July's Food-Only Index was 107.35 but declined to 106.97 in August.&nbsp; Please note that the peak index reading for each category was 111.32 in January 2015 for the Total Index and 115.13 in December 2014 for the Food-Only Index.&nbsp; Since those peaks, the Total Index has given up 56% of the price increases that had occurred since the Index's inception in November 2010; the Food-Only Index component has given up 54% of the price increases that occurred since November 2010.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>If it&#8217;s not about me, then who is it about?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>My principal goal as a parent and father is to raise children to become moral and productive adults, capable of taking care of themselves in the great wide world.&nbsp; This seems to have once been a simpler task given that more and more young adults are coming out of college saddled with debt and either returning home or at best, treading water while they look for the opportunity that permits them to flourish as full-fledged adults.&nbsp; But that goes to the productive side of the equation; where my wife and I have worked assiduously is to help develop their moral side.&nbsp; Apart from the usual perceived affliction of church attendance and religious education, we've pushed service, requiring volunteer service even before it rears its head in middle and high school.&nbsp; When each of the kids has reached 13 years of age, we've required that they find an outlet for volunteer service and each has responded in kind and now Youngest has his own gig, thoroughly different from his older siblings and very much in keeping with his developing Linus-like sensibility:  <em>I love mankind, it's people that I can't stand.</em>&nbsp; As we've talked through the years, I've gone back to one of the multiple communication taglines that reiterates the point - <em>it's not about you, kid</em> - and each has heard it repeatedly.&nbsp; Youngest has probably heard it more than either of the other two because he's sometimes been present when said to his siblings but hasn't had the experience and maturity to comprehend the full meaning.</p>
<p>But even when the younger kids aren't saying anything, it doesn't mean that they aren't thinking about it.&nbsp; <em>If it's not about me, then who is it about?</em> was the question that came off of Youngest's lips as we sat in the car several weeks ago.&nbsp; There was nothing sarcastic about the question, asked as we drove to get yet another pair of shoes for a growing young teen.&nbsp; He'd been puzzling over it because he's heard me say it so often through the years.&nbsp; Children are by nature ego-centric and it's only as they grow and their perspective widens that not only the awareness of existence, but also the welfare of the others, begins to develop.&nbsp; Self moves first to immediate and then extended family, then outwards to friends and hopefully beyond that to others who aren't necessarily even acquaintances.&nbsp; But being a moral person means not only an awareness of others but also a willingness to work in ways that benefits others, even if they aren't friends and family, and that is a perspective that frequently has to be taught both by conversation and example.&nbsp; But the effort to raise a moral person is frequently opposed by the tone and tenor of modern American culture.</p>
<p>That we live in a narcissistic society is a well-documented given.&nbsp; For the record, <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/narcissism" title="dictionary.com">narcissism</a> is defined as <em>inordinate fascination with oneself; self-love; vanity</em> and highly covered and somewhat controversial books have documented that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/science/seeing-narcissists-everywhere.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0" title="nytimes.com">psychological test scores measuring narcissistic tendencies</a> have increased over the past three decades.&nbsp; A deliberate societal push for self-esteem - sometimes without the backing of any actual accomplishment - joins with a stunning array of personal electronic devices that permit the user to record their image and voice again and again <em>and again</em> in the search for perceived cool perfection; with an ability to immediately delete what's not wanted and an immense memory storage and the focus inward is hard to resist.&nbsp; This rise in narcissism is an inherent threat to morality since it's predicated upon self while morality is predicated - at least partially - upon caring for the welfare of others.&nbsp; The narcissist's view is inwards and superficial while that of the moral person is outwards and - hopefully - deeper.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So the effort as the kids age is to get them to shift that perspective outwards and away from themselves.&nbsp; It means considerable conversation - occasionally a monologue when they're sullen - and a deliberate effort to engage them in the outside world, helping them find a meaningful way to work on the behalf of others.&nbsp; It means a willingness to establish limits on the electronics, whether refusing to allow certain devices or setting limits on usage time and media content.&nbsp; It means a willingness on your own part to model the kind of behavior that you wish them to exhibit.&nbsp; It isn't a one-off instance but instead a lengthy and constant process that can be both rewarding as well as tiring, sometimes throwing another iron into the fire of a family schedule.&nbsp; It is about teaching them that there is more beyond simply themselves and their own needs and wants and that real progress can come when a few are willing to step up and lead; when others see the effort, they will often in turn be drawn out from within and join the effort on behalf of others.&nbsp; There are all manner of student organizations, student honor societies and school districts that promote voluntary service hours amongst youth, but the primary focus has to be from within the family itself because that's where the child is going to get the greatest example and emphasis.

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - July 2015</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The pricing for the July 2015 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index was completed last week and this is one of those months where honestly, not much happens.&nbsp; The Total Index (comprising the full marketbasket of 47 grocery store items priced at three separate and unrelated grocery stores) did drop from June's 107.11 to a new level of 106.30 while the Food-only Index (comprising the basket's 37 foodstuff items) rose however from June's 106.46 to July's 107.35.&nbsp; So the question is, how can foodstuffs rise while the total index declines?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past seven months, the grocers have taken multiple steps to lower their regular prices.&nbsp; One chain implemented new regular store-brand pricing under a <em>Low Everyday Prices</em> banner while another took similar steps under an <em>Everyday Low Prices</em> banner; yep, you can't make this up.&nbsp; Those two had decreased the regular, non-sale prices of a multitude of store-brand items and as the effects of these flowed through the Price Index, the independent grocer switched the supplier of its store brand items so that the lower prices on items were noted by the Index as well.&nbsp; The result was notable as an almost ripple effect on the results as one change after another in the span of December 2015 through July 2015 affected the Index downwards in a deflationary manner.&nbsp; The most recent effects are from the independent grocer as it continues to roll out new store-brand items; this occurs both as they become available and as the old inventory items from the previous supplier are exhausted and subsequently replaced by the new items so that any rollout can take months before it's completed.&nbsp; In July's edition of the Index, the independent introduced the new supplier's version of plastic kitchen trash bags (13 gallon) at a price that was 29% lower than the old supplier's offering.&nbsp; Couple this with some much smaller changes on non-foodstuff items and the effect is significant.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Amongst the 37 item foodstuff components, what was notable was the effect of hot dogs.&nbsp; In this case, one of the chain's store-brand hot dogs joined the other in a stealth-inflation increase as the packaging decreased from a full pound per eight hot dogs to 15 ounces and since I monitor that item by weight - one pound being the original standard - I adjusted the price upwards to reflect what it would be had it continued with the conventional 16 ounce packaging.&nbsp; But unlike all of the other months however, the independent grocer's store-brand hot dogs simply disappeared from the case and it continued to be gone over the multiple visits that I made to that store to check on the hot dogs (and yes, it seems odd to walk into a grocery store, look in a case and just walk out again).&nbsp; The independent's brand has been consistently less than the chain brand hot dogs and this absence meant that the average for the hot dogs is now significantly higher than before - hence the higher index level, all other things being equal.&nbsp; My suspicion is that they're in the process of shifting that product - hot dogs - to the new supplier but that it simply wasn't available yet and I'll see that in the next month's edition.&nbsp; To be honest, there has been a hot dog brand that cost less than even the independent's store-brand but I've not monitored that since the supposition from the outset of the Index was that I'd be following store-brands whenever they were available and before I deviate, I want to assure that this isn't a case of just awaiting a new supplier's product.&nbsp; If that doesn't happen, then I will move to that lower-priced brand in lieu of the store-brand product.&nbsp; What was fascinating in a massively geeky way was that the independent's case for hot dogs was missing multiple brands and much of the space had been given to larger packages of sausages in what appeared to be an attempt to keep it from looking completely barren.&nbsp; We'll have to see how it appears next month.&nbsp; And yes, the price of eggs increased due to diminished supply because of the Avian Influenza that's wiped out about a tenth of the nation's flock, also contributing to the higher level, but it was frankly less of an increase than I expected.</p>

 <title>A Summation to Date&#8230;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Change happens.&nbsp; It sometimes comes unexpectedly and in the blink of an eye and at other times, with considerable notice and more than a little planning.&nbsp; As I write this, Middle is on the cusp of leaving for his freshman year in college; when I began writing this website, he was in the fifth grade.&nbsp; Eldest is working two summer jobs to squirrel away money for her final year of college and she was in middle school when the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/2" title="practicaldad.com - What to Expect...">first article</a> ran in 2008.&nbsp; Last night, I realized that Youngest has continued his persistent growth spurt as I now have to slightly incline my face to look into my eighth-grader's eyes.&nbsp; When I began this project, he was just entering kindergarten.</p>
<p>Some years ago, my better half suggested that I write a book.&nbsp; I personally enjoy writing although it's sometimes been frustrating because being the stay-at-home parent with active kids doesn't always lend itself to long periods of time for reflection and composition.&nbsp; Activities, errands, meals, laundry, paperwork and all of the things that make a household run means that the traditional model of sitting down for hours to compose an essay or article isn't always operative.&nbsp; Never having written a book and knowing that the <em>fatherhood is cool but look at the funny things that happen when Dad is in the household</em> meme was well covered, I opted to start with a website instead with the notion of moving on to a book.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That hasn't yet happened.&nbsp; But after more than 740 articles and essays to date, I've learned a few things.&nbsp; The first is that the writer that I've become is not the writer that I was at the inception of this site.&nbsp; I believe that a writer has to have a <em>voice</em> and what I write now is nothing like what I wrote at first because I simply didn't yet have one.&nbsp; My voice is that of a father who sees massive change ahead and who wants desperately to raise his children to be productive and moral adults in an America that's going to be truly different from the one in which I was raised.&nbsp; I am a late Boomer, now in my mid-fifties, and believe that my generation has done a poor job of parenting, most especially in letting their children become wrapped into an electronic cocoon and devoid of the guidance and information that kids need in a complicated culture.&nbsp; I do not believe that a person raised as part of the <em>Me generation</em> - who truly embraces that notion - is the best fit for a role that is as far removed from <em>Me</em> as being a parent.&nbsp; It is personally galling to talk to a young person and hear the phrase <em>I wish that someone had told me</em> and my personal vow has been that my own children never be able to say that about me.</p>
<p>The second is that I'm not the kind of writer who can just sit and write a quick article in response to one thing or another.&nbsp; A publicist told me years ago - yeah, I tried that - that I was what was referred to as a source writer, someone who wrote in the background and frequently provided materials for others but never engendered an avid following that left a lengthy comment thread.&nbsp; She was correct because I find it difficult to write quickly and can indeed spend hours - and on a few occasion, days - to find the right information and words for a particular article or idea.&nbsp; It's honestly a bit lonely since I hear so little in response yet it's immensely gratifying to know that over the years, so many have taken the time to place me on their Syndication Feed</content:encoded>

 <title>Keeping in Touch as Kids Age</title>
 <content:encoded><p>One of the questions that I've asked myself as the kids age and begin to move out into the world - whether camping trips or high school trips - is how much I should try to keep in contact with them.&nbsp; It was one thing when they were younger and going away and either my wife or I could expect the typical homesickness/touch-base call.&nbsp; But it came into focus when Eldest went off to college three years ago and it's one that I'm asking again as Middle now prepares for college departure.</p>
<p>One of the knocks on my generation's parenting is that we're <em>helicopter parents</em>, constantly there to protect and smother the kids in our effort to make their lives safer and better.&nbsp; Yet that term can itself be confusing as Eldest's college dean implied to parents at freshman orientation that parents who went to all of the kids' events and games were such; after all, his parents - in the 1960s - only made one of his own high school games and my personal opinion is that he's suffering a case of sour grapes.&nbsp; In a conversation two years ago, Youngest - then still in elementary school - commented that he viewed hovering parents as <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/581" title="PracticalDad:  I'm a Helicopter Parent or a Shelter Parent?">shelter parents</a> who attempted to shelter their children from all possible mishaps.&nbsp; Youngest's case-in-point then pertained to a baseball parent who yelled at a coach during a game; it's an event that has happened since that time almost three years ago.&nbsp; To his credit, Youngest has made it clear that if he gets yelled at by a coach in my presence, it's my job to shut up.</p>
<p>But the question remains:  how should communication occur after they depart?&nbsp; My own experience in going to college was that, barring unexpected questions or situations, I should call my parents collect once a week on a predetermined night.&nbsp; As it was, there were plenty of unexpected situations my freshman year and the phone calls were a bit more frequent for the first semester at least.&nbsp; But the newer technology base makes communication easier and more ubiquitous.&nbsp; Many parents require that kids with a Facebook account "friend" them, at least for the account that the folks know about.&nbsp; Parents can thus see the latest photos of Junior dressed up with his date before the big party on the public account while Junior's peers get to see the grisly after-party photos on Junior's private account site.&nbsp; No, kids, we're not stupid.&nbsp; The almost-universal presence of cellphones - or as I refer to them around the kids, <em>texty-thingies</em> - means that we parents have the capability to step in to help the kid with a problem on a moment's notice.&nbsp; That presumes that (a) the kid wants our help and asks for it, and (b) that we have the willingness to help them should they ask.&nbsp; If I want my kids to be productive and moral adults, capable of standing on their own two feet, then I have to accept that both (a) and (b) have corollaries.&nbsp; The corollary to (a) would be that things might not turn out optimally because the kid chose to attempt management on her own without my input and if that's the case, then my job is to monitor my own mouth and perhaps offer a quiet <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/625" title="PracticalDad:  The Post-Mortem">post-mortem</a> at a later time.&nbsp; The corollary to (b) would be that there might come a time when I opt not to assist but instead stand back and let them deal with the issue themselves with whatever subsequent consequences might arise.&nbsp; It could be a highly valuable object lesson but one that's painful for the immediate relationship and something that I'd have to decide was worth the pain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understand that the question will come at one point or another.&nbsp; Being a parent means that we have to gradually cede ground on autonomy and independence as the kids age and the true gift is to ascertain when and how much to cede; to say that it's an imprecise process is an understatement.&nbsp; Take the time now to consider what your guidelines with the kids might be and understand that you and your mate might very well have different expectations on what those might be; my wife is in closer contact to the kids via text than I am while I might go for weeks between texts or phone calls.&nbsp; My own comments have been that I'll be happy to speak with you whenever you so choose and will answer any questions that you might have...but don't blindside me with bad news unless it's truly unexpected.&nbsp; There will be miscommunications and there will be the occasional hard feelings but if you take some time to think about your expectations and go over them in advance, the potential damage can be minimized and you can move on to a newer, more well-defined adult relationship.</p>

 <title>So&#8230;What is This Middle Class?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There's been an ongoing flow of ink and discussion about the decline and potential demise of the American Middle Class, that economic entity in which many Americans were raised.&nbsp; The data over the past seven years has shown material damage to the entity with a drop in median family income as well as a loss in median family assets.&nbsp; A record number of Americans are receiving food assistance, more than 93 million are no longer in the workforce and the discrepancy in wealth distribution is now at a point not seen since the Gilded Age of more than a century ago.&nbsp; My own thinking in the more recent past has been about the questions, <em>what precisely is the American Middle Class and how did it come to exist?&nbsp; When did it become a real thing and what factors led to its rise?</em>&nbsp; I don't believe that you can remedy a situation until you manage to understand it and frankly, focusing on only the economic data is akin to saying that the patient died of massive hemorrhaging when that hemorrhaging was actually caused by multiple gunshots from a Sonny Corleone-style gangland shooting.&nbsp; And yes, that is a purposefully pointed analogy.</p>
<p>What we're watching now is just a bleeding out from a wounded mass of people, but that hemorrhaging is the result of both purposeful and inadvertant policy decisions that have occurred over the course of decades.&nbsp; This American Middle Class didn't just arise because a gaggle of World War Two veterans returned home and said <em>Woot!  We survived, so let's start buying!</em>&nbsp; It arose from the culmination of four principal factors that coalesced together after more than a half-century of oft-times painful development.&nbsp; Had any of these factors not occurred, my belief is that what we've come to appreciate and mourn would probably never have existed in the first place and we'd have been no different as a nation than any other developing nation with an intransigent oligarchy.</content:encoded>

 <title>Civics versus Reality:&nbsp; Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Kids</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Part of my job as a father - a parent - is to raise the kids to take their place in the world as moral and productive adults.&nbsp; The conversations continue beyond the birds and the bees, which is good since they're all old enough that if I were now discussing birds and bees with them, I'd probably have multiple grandchildren.&nbsp; But a significant part of those conversations go to what's occurring in the world around them and how reality frequently conflicts with what they've learned in school.&nbsp; Such is the case with a conversation about the June 12 vote on <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1314/text" title="congress.gov">HR 1314</a>, in which the House of Representatives denied the President the right to "fast-track" approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade treaty.</p>
<p>The conversation happened twice, the first with Middle and again later that evening with Eldest, Youngest and my wife.&nbsp; In each case, it was generally composed of three segments.&nbsp; The first was a general description of what little was known the TPP treaty and that led to the other two segments.&nbsp; Why was so little known about it and how in the hell could the President get away with making open disclosure of such contents prosecutable.&nbsp; In the case of the former, little is known about it and purposefully so.&nbsp; Perhaps the most glaring is that <em>supranational</em> rights would be given to corporations, i.e. that if a foreign corporation objected to a local law, be it state or federal, it could appeal that law to an international court and if upheld, could have said law overturned.&nbsp; The example that I used with each was <em>if a Chinese corporation wanted to build a plant in a neighboring township and didn't like the environmental regulations, they could take their case to an international court and have those regulations overturned so that they could proceed with their plant.</em>&nbsp; Incendiary perhaps, but still a legitimate example and one that's pertinent since there's been an ongoing local controversy about an American firm running a gas pipeline through the area despite significant public opposition.&nbsp; It's bad enough that we're becoming part of a domestic corporate fascism with those organizations gaining increasing power over the individual; to be additionally at the mercy of the wishes of a foreign corporation - be it Chinese, German or English - is intolerable.</p>
<p>The next part of the conversation went to the fact that the document itself is heavily guarded and protected as to contents.&nbsp; It can only be read by members of Congress in a particular basement, guarded, and any notes must be destroyed.&nbsp; If anyone is caught publicizing details of the proposed treaty, they can be criminally prosecuted.&nbsp; Still, aspects of the treaty have made it to light and that includes the supranational status given to corporations.&nbsp; Another aspect that's come out via leaks and analysis by the New York Times is that the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied heavily on its behalf, most notably for increased intellectual property protection.&nbsp; While that's certainly a legitimate concern that goes to pharmaceuticals as well as any other number of industries and products, there is also a push for increased control of patents so that generic drugs would take longer to come to market and keep the cost of medications higher for longer than it is now.&nbsp; In a society that's seeing more medical costs being borne by the consumer as deductibles move higher, this is an additional burden on stretched family budgets in the event of medical difficulty.</p>
<p>The vote itself, which was defeated by a large Democratic House contingent joining with some Republicans, was to approve a "fast track" vote on the bill, whose Senate corollary had already been approved.&nbsp; This fast tracking would've forced a straight yes or no vote on the treaty with no debate and with no allowance for any changes whatsoever.&nbsp; Indeed, Representative Paul Ryan (R) echoed Nancy Pelosi (D) when she spoke the Obamacare vote:  <em>you'll find out what's in it after you vote for it.</em>&nbsp; This simple comment was as astounding coming around the second time as it was coming around the first and equally appalling.</p>
<p>The response from all of the kids - Youngest is quite capable of playing up to his elder siblings - was simple disbelief.&nbsp; None of this was what they'd learned about in their Civics classes - or in Youngest's case, from talking with me - and it was difficult to reconcile with the theory that they'd learned about the fabled American democracy with it's freedom of speech and constitutional system of checks and balances.&nbsp; And honestly, apart from multiple comments as to unconstitutional, the one word that caught my attention was <em>tyranny.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tyranny, indeed.&nbsp; And this came from the mouth of a teenager.</p>
<p>So what's the upshot of all of this?&nbsp; There are several...the first is that the kids are absolutely capable in their teen years of learning and understanding what's going on in their nation and the world, provided that you're willing to take the time to talk with them.&nbsp; It's fine if you tell them to turn off their electronics for a few minutes of discussion, although the first time or two that you do it will seem more like a monologue than a dialogue.&nbsp; It's important that you get your salient facts straight and present them with as little rancor as possible, even if you should be wrapping your head with duct tape to keep it from exploding, so that you don't come off as the foaming-at-the-mouth old man.&nbsp; And the last is that you have an obligation as a parent, like it or not, to stay apprised of what's going on in the world around you.&nbsp; It isn't enough anymore to feed and clothe them anymore.&nbsp; There are events and movements within this country that will require our greater attention and activism - yes, I said it - if we're going to give them a nation worthy of them.</p>

 <title>When Real-Time Economics Hits Home</title>
 <content:encoded><p>I live for teachable moments and the unfortunate reality is that larger macroeconomic issues do hit here within the household.&nbsp; Such is the case with Eldest, who's forking away as much into savings as possible for the coming year.</p>
<p>The larger issue is obviously the transition from a sustainable living wage economy to one of predominantly part-time jobs.&nbsp; According to the government statistics - and I'll admit to believing that a fair portion of the government reporting structure is rigged - there have been millions of jobs created within the past several years yet the majority of them are only part-time, sans the benefits which many of the previous generations received.&nbsp; The scenario simply beggars the imagination and I recently asked Middle, the AP economics student, to explain how we could a record number of Americans both on food assistance as well as out of the workforce yet have what some economists might consider as full employment with a rate of - at that time - 5.4%.&nbsp; To his credit, he did identify ask whether the jobs were full-time and that led to some conversation and explanation about employment statistics...most especially that once a person had any kind of job, even a part-time job at 15 hours weekly, they were no longer considered as unemployed and therefore out of the unemployment rate calculation.&nbsp; And this is where the problem lies:  that we're now reaping the globalization policy effects as sustainable living jobs for the typical person have been outsourced to other nations.</p>
<p>It was a short conversation with Eldest the other morning about when she was working over the next two days, since the body count is always a factor in dinner plans.&nbsp; She updated me on her hours and expressed frustration with one of her employers.&nbsp; I have to give her credit since she's willing to work and puts in time at two separate jobs, one within the restaurant business and the other within retail.&nbsp; She successfully schedules her hours and is able to routinely work more than 45 hours weekly and on some weeks has surpassed 55 hours of work; it was the same last summer when she put in similar hours albeit only with the restaurant.&nbsp; The difference that she's finding however, is that as a non-server employee at the restaurant, she was paid hourly instead of wait-staff rates and the hours that she garnered - because she routinely picked up every other employee's shift request - meant that she made significant overtime.&nbsp; So significant that when the management finally reviewed their records late last August, they found that labor costs had risen beyond budgeted because of all of her overtime pay.&nbsp; Their conversation with her was actually gentle since they recognized that they had a keeper as a hostess but the message was clear - <em>no overtime for you!</em>.&nbsp; That carried over into their hiring for this current summer as they hired sufficient numbers for hosts and hostesses that the ability to garner overtime would be simply impossible.&nbsp; <em>It's crazy,</em> Eldest commented, <em>since there are hosts who might only work for one or two shifts each week...I mean, it's stupid.</em>&nbsp; I went to the question of why they might do that and once she got past the irritability of it's perceived stupidity, we got to the meat of labor costs.&nbsp; They have a budget within which they have to keep and the unfortunate reality is that it's presently a fully-blown employer's market with a surplus of available labor to meet needs; that it's not at all uncommon for employers to now have an excess number of employees available so that fewer shifts can be given to many and any possible overtime avoided.&nbsp; That paid benefits might only go to those few who actually work more than 40 hours weekly makes it a two-fer as almost nobody hits that mark and that aspect of labor costs is dropped from the bottom line.&nbsp; Her bottom line is that she's seeing how the same number of hours worked at two jobs leads to less money because the overtime differential is gone.&nbsp; The conversation petered out as she prepared to leave to meet with a friend but she did take the commentary in and I suspect that she's processed it.</p>
<p>There's been a recurrent point that bothers me.&nbsp; We live in a society that's been parsed and segmented and all of the various news media play to their own fan base.&nbsp; MSNBC, Fox and CNN all have their various segments and much of the commentary goes to the notion of <em>them</em>, that others are either the cause or the effect of one policy or another.&nbsp; But the simple truth is that what's occurring around us isn't happening to <em>them</em>, it's happening to <em>us</em> and in many cases, the <em>us</em> is our children since they have to live with the effects of the various corporate policies as they play out.&nbsp; It's not your kids or my kids, it's <em>our</em> kids.&nbsp; The more that we can recognize the larger issues within our own daily lives, the more that we can teach them and help them learn to navigate this system of ours.&nbsp; And hopefully create the template for change that's more positive because it's sometimes the little things that cumulatively make a larger difference.</p>
<p>Like a college kid's willingness to work overtime.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>A View From the Ridge,&nbsp; Part 6</title>
 <content:encoded><p>As I've said before, parenting is a forest for the trees experience.&nbsp; Toddlers become children and grow, become active and engaged in the world around them, and the plethora of life can narrow your view to the immediate moments of this day and the next, akin to the trees in a thick wood.&nbsp; But there are moments when the foliage opens and you recognize that you're on a ridge with a view that spans for miles; you're now allowed to get a glimpse of the wider vista and can see both forward and back.</p>
<p>Such a moment was the other night when Middle donned cap and gown to receive his high school diploma.&nbsp; The event was held at a local college's sporting complex to accommodate the graduates and their thousands of parents, family and friends.&nbsp; Having to help with an elderly relative, Eldest was dispatched with her boyfriend  to the venue as soon as doors opened in order to claim seats that would require minimal walking.&nbsp; Middle went to the high school around dinnertime to join his peers on the school buses that would carry them to the ceremony and his girlfriend arrived shortly after that to join us for the graduation.&nbsp; Youngest - decked out in suit and bow tie - was tasked with assisting his elders while I spent an undue amount of time finding parking after dropping everybody off at the site.</p>
<p>But once I was finally in and seated, able to cut across to my seat about 40 yards ahead of the processing seniors, I took a deep breath and in a few moments was able to enjoy the trailhead and distant scenery.&nbsp; Turning around on the ridge, I looked behind to see how our family's trail had narrowed somewhat when Eldest graduated and went off to college herself.&nbsp; I could see how older trails were meandering along from a distance until they more closely paralleled ours and far closer, how Eldest's trail had once again returned to ours for a short period.&nbsp; When I swung my view forward, I could see the older trails still paralleling ours for the indeterminate period and how our own path was narrowing yet again as Middle left in one direction for college and Eldest returned to her own college.&nbsp; These separate paths wouldn't necessarily be far away but they would at times be hidden from our view and we could only hope that the kids were sufficiently well-raised and prepared that they'd successfully forge ahead without undue mishap.&nbsp; As I surveyed our terrain ahead, the two parallel paths - ours and our elders - once again led into the woods although it's certain that the forest isn't as thick as it had been in the past twenty-one years.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended within two hours and another 264 adults-in-training took their place.&nbsp; Apart from my own son's appearance in cap and gown, what struck me was the ovation given to the 13 graduates who were moving on to military service.&nbsp; I could only utter a silent prayer on their behalf as they took their place in the armed forces, serving where sent.&nbsp; They entered for various reasons, ranging from the desire to travel, gain specialized education or just serve their country and yet my fear is that the civilian leadership is incapable of using them wisely and stretching them to a point at which they break, either individually or en masse.&nbsp; Their own landscape will be more fraught with pitfalls and potentially darker than that of their peers.</p>
<p>We're now back into the woods as the older kids come and go with jobs and friends while Youngest enjoys the final summers before he will also begin his journey into the work experience.&nbsp; But take the opportunity to step back whenever you can to see where you are and what's around you...the view can be magnificent.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - June 2015:&nbsp; Crashing</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Let's divorce ourselves from the notion that the PracticalDad Price Index monitors the pricing activity of a fairly typical family marketbasket from a grocery store - or three separate and unrelated stores as in the case of the Index.&nbsp; Let's say that the figures represent an unknown something that could just as easily be good as bad.&nbsp; Now assume that the figures have risen from a baseline of 100 to a high of 115.33 over a period of 49 months, a rise carved with ups and downs but generally following an upwards trend.&nbsp; If you were to find that this increase over a 49 month period was eliminated by more than one half - 57% to be exact - in just six months, how would you describe it?&nbsp; A drop?&nbsp; A decline?&nbsp; A fall?&nbsp; A collapse?&nbsp; A crash?&nbsp; The wording can be argued but my gut response is that it would be akin to a crash, a sudden crunching of the upwards slope in such a way as to suggest that said curve ran headlong into a concrete abutment and folded in upon itself.</p>
<p>Such is the case with the June 2015 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index as the Total Index fell yet again to 107.11 in June from May's previous reading of 107.56 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; This is the fourth decline in six months from the December 2014 level of 111.18.&nbsp; But whereas the Total Index covers all <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="practicaldad.com">47 items in the marketbasket</a>, what has grabbed my attention is the simple collapse of the Food-Only Sub-index, which consists of the 37 foodstuff items within the larger 47 item marketbasket.&nbsp; It's this sub-index (again, November 2010 = 100) which has historically shown the effects of price increases and decreases, while the non-food items have, for the most part, been generally controlled.&nbsp; The Food-Only Sub-index reached it's zenith in December 2014 at 115.33; yet it subsequently began a steepening slide that led to June's Sub-Index reading of 106.46.&nbsp; This is the crash to which I'm referring in the title - that fully 57% of prices increasing over four and a half years has been wiped away in six months.&nbsp; Yes, a pound of 80% ground beef is still high and the rising price of a dozen large eggs is starting to show the effect of the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/21/poultry-turkey-avian-flu-crisis/26100287/" title="usatoday.com">spreading Avian influenza</a> through the national poultry flocks but these supply and demand issues are being played out against price declines in other foodstuffs as deflationary pressures come into play in a complex and dynamic process.</p>
<p>So what is this deflationary pressure and how is it playing out in the stores?</p>
<p>Understand that the price changes in inflation (upward) and deflation (downward) are symptomatic of other underlying issues and in the case of deflation, the biggest underlying issue is the amount of money flowing through the economy; in the case of most, that flow would come from the family income.&nbsp; The Fed, and other central banks, are terrified of deflation and want inflation.&nbsp; Their premise is that rising prices mean that producers and manufacturers can charge more for their products and then in turn pass that along to their employees via higher wages or hiring of more people - in the ideal world, both would happen - and these happy employees would feel wealthier and more comfortable.&nbsp; That would then lead to greater spending by the employees and their families, meaning that more would then flow back to the producers and manufacturers and the cycle would continue.&nbsp; The policy response of the central banks is framed by their predecessors' experience during the Great Depression of 1929 in which deflation ruled the day.&nbsp; Businesses lost complete control of their capacity to maintain pricing as consumers lost their money and cut back on spending; as spending was curbed, less was bought and businesses were forced to lower their prices to compete with the result that the employees weren't receiving higher pay.&nbsp; As they didn't see wage increases and saw other businesses slowly shutter, they in turn cut back on spending further to protect themselves and businesses saw even fewer sales, meaning even more downward pressures.&nbsp; The result was a highly negative reinforcing cycle that culminated in a quarter of the American workforce unemployed and thousands of businesses and banks shuttered forever.&nbsp; So the ability to control pricing is key and that in turn depends upon the ability of people to spend and that ultimately depends upon people having something to spend in the first place.</p>
<p>That's lovely...but how does that theory seem to be playing out in the grocery stores?&nbsp; What I've seen over the past several months appears to be significant changes in pricing strategy.&nbsp; The backdrop to all of this is that the median family income is dropping across the country and that's compounded by the burgeoning number of Americans now receiving food assistance, so the money flow simply isn't there as it was several years ago.&nbsp; There was a period within the past decade in which grocery stores upgraded themselves with coffee kiosks and delis, enlarging and appealing to a more upscale clientele.&nbsp; As the money flows out of the general economy however, people feel less inclined to spend and the cosmetic changes matter less and the stores' ability to compete is increasingly reduced to bareknuckle price competition.&nbsp; During the first quarter, one grocery store in the survey, owned by an international chain, instituted an "Everyday Low Pricing" policy with a lower price on multiple common foodstuff items.&nbsp; Meat, a supply-and-demand affected item, was still expensive but from one month to the next, items such as bananas and potatos, canned vegetables, and other foodstuffs underwent significant price decreases.&nbsp; Approximately two months later, another grocer - an independent but one which whose generic brand is produced by a national chain on behalf of independents - began a wholesale switch to another generic brand producer and the prices on multiple foodstuff items underwent a corresponding decline.&nbsp; This particular change is still playing out in the store as they still sell the discontinued generic brand and will do so until their inventory is exhausted, at which point I anticipate that they'll offer only the new generic label; it's happened before and I expect it to happen again.&nbsp; The remaining grocer is a regional grocery chain and has had difficulty maintaining prices relative to the two competitors and until this month, I hadn't seen much different in terms of their pricing.&nbsp; What I observed the other day during the pricing however, was a number of lower priced items in the marketbasket and in those cases, there was also signage indicating a new "everyday low pricing" policy.&nbsp; This was particularly the case with lunchmeat, deli cheese and bananas as the minimum drop amongst the three items was 20%.&nbsp; In the case of this third grocery chain, I know from first hand experience that they've had profitability issues and have dealt with it by closing stores and reducing hours at other locations.&nbsp; The evidence suggests to me that despite these issues, they're having to compete with the others now on the price front.</p>
<p>So the evidence suggests that amongst the falling income/money flow through the general economy, the three grocers are now competing on a price front - much as their Depressionary forebears did 75 years ago.&nbsp; If this income situation isn't somehow rectified in the relatively near future, the prospect is that the grocers will lose control of their pricing in a deflationary spiral and one or more will fail and the first will be that one which doesn't have the sufficient buying power that comes from larger entities.&nbsp; For example, which would you consider to fail first - Walmart or Joe's corner grocery?&nbsp; Because people aren't spending and making money course through the economy, the prospect exists that one or more of these grocers will fail - and this fear of more failing businesses is the rationale behind the policies of the central banks.&nbsp; It is also the fear behind Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Hilsenrath's <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/06/02/grand-central-a-letter-to-stingy-american-consumers/" title="wsj.com/real time economics">likely to be infamous letter to American consumers</a>.</p>
<p>One final note when you look at the Indices results from December 2014 through June 2015.&nbsp; The column entitled "Spread" pertains to the differential between the Total Index reading and the reading for the Food-Only Sub-Index.&nbsp; I began to use it some time ago since I found it helpful to indicate the level of activity on the part of the Sub-Index versus the entire Index.&nbsp; You'll note that as of December 2014, the spread between the two readings was 3.95 basis points and was positive because the Food-Only Sub-Index had risen that much higher in comparison to it's Total Index companion.&nbsp; But over the past six months, this spread has declined significantly and consistently until June 2015 when the spread was actually (.65), meaning that the Total Index was now actually higher than the Sub-Index...something that hasn't happened before in the four and a half year history of the PracticalDad Price Index.&nbsp; Yes folks, food prices - as measured on a marketbasket basis - are now dropping.</p>

 <title>...here at the end of all things</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Frodo Baggins</em></p>
<p>For the last time in more than 2300 mornings, Middle once again came down to breakfast for a quick bite to eat before departing for school.&nbsp; I commented that this was effectively the last day of school for him as his classes ended and he only had an amusement park class trip and graduation practice before donning cap and gown.&nbsp; He sipped at his drink and quoted a line from Peter Jackson's <em>Return of the King: I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.</em>&nbsp; Standing and working at the kitchen sink, I nodded and responded, <em>Except that this isn't an end, son.&nbsp; It's a beginning.</em>&nbsp; He could only concur.</p>
<p>And for him, it is a beginning.&nbsp; He's still a teenager with that breed's sensibilities - or occasional lack thereof - and sense of invincibility and confidence.&nbsp; In less than three months, he will join his two best friends at an urban university to study and pursue his love, acting.&nbsp; And then my wife and I will be left only with Youngest in the house, still in middle school but rapidly growing and maturing; I can now look into his eyes without having to lower my face and as my wife stated in a conversation to another <em>he really is an old soul.</em></p>
<p>But while it's a beginning for Middle, neither is it an end for my wife and I.&nbsp; It is instead a transition for us as he takes first steps of independence and adulthood.&nbsp; He bears some of the stamps of adulthood already, both being able to vote and serve in the military yet he's only now an <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/590" title="PracticalDad:  Is an 18 Year old an Adult?">adult-in-training</a>.&nbsp; He will leave for college and I expect that there will be the periodic phone calls and questions about procedures, processes and situations as he continues the process of maturation.&nbsp; God knows that my own father received more than his fair share as I witnessed and waded through episodes of what can charitably be described as debauchery during my freshman year of college - <em>Dear God, Dad...how do I handle this kind of thing?</em> - and even beyond.&nbsp; It also leads to a more general question, and that is how I myself wish to see this relationship as we both age.&nbsp; As he joins his elder sister in moving along and upwards on the Bell Curve of maturity and capability, it's obviously apparent that my own position on the same curve is not on an upwards trajectory.&nbsp; Middle-age is a time when a person is generally moving along a plateau of physical, emotional and intellectual capabilities before the gradual effects of age take their own toll, although at differing rates for each of capabilities.&nbsp; <em>50 is the new 35?&nbsp; Yeah, but only with sufficient quantities of Ibuprofen and Scotch and occasionally in combination...</em>&nbsp; Sprinkle in an awareness of the effects of advanced old age from being <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/684" title="PracticalDad:  The Sandwiched Generation">sandwiched</a> and it becomes a question with a bit more emotional immediacy even if it's unlikely that I'll find myself in a similar situation.&nbsp; Don't even be surprised if you and your mate each sees a different answer to the relationship question.&nbsp; The point is that it's something worth considering since it's obvious that you won't want it to end and yet, it cannot remain the same.</p>
<p>I'm fortunate in that this relationship change is already taking place with Eldest, even though I'm not certain quite how it would be described; I only know that it's different and as long as we both are satisfied with it, that's alright.</p>
<p>Perhaps Tolkien's classic trilogy is a good analogy for what's taking place.&nbsp; In the end, Frodo and Sam survived with their relationship matured.&nbsp; Each better understood the other and had a renewed respect for what each had accomplished on the journey.&nbsp; Raising a child is a long, long journey but with every journey, there's a beginning and an end.&nbsp; What happens when that journey together ends isn't written in stone at the beginning but it's something that will be slowly carved when the next step of their journey begins.&nbsp; By this time, your child is in some ways an adult and is capable of viewing life and relationships with a fairly astute eye; to think that their next steps will entail the exact same relationship with you as when they were children will only assure an ugly carving, if one is carved at all.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Cashless America:&nbsp; The Kids&#8217; Perspective (Part 2)</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Note:  This is a follow-up to a previous article - <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/754" title="practicaldad.com">Cashless America:  The Set-Up</a> - which recently ran on the site.&nbsp; The two were originally meant to be one article focusing on the response of my two older kids, Eldest and Middle, but it made more sense to split it into two pieces, the first of which briefly laid out the gist of the arguments from proponents of moving to a digital, cashless currency.&nbsp; Now I'll get on to the kids' perspectives.</p>
<p>After reading a spate of articles about the notion of abolishing physical currency, I thought that it would be interesting to see what Eldest and Middle thought of the concept.&nbsp; Eldest is a rising college senior home from a semester abroad, intent on making bank for the coming year.&nbsp; Middle is a high school senior who will leave for college in the Fall and is now finishing AP Economics (which, if you've ever read the supporting textbook, is a certifiable cure for insomnia and has absolutely no bearing on anything approaching reality for nascent adults).</p>
<p>Middle was first up as he was first down for breakfast and I prefaced my question with the caveat that I'd simply like a cogent response by the evening...<em>just take a little time through the day to think about this and if I could have a response by evening, that would be great...</em>&nbsp; The question was this:  what would you think if our nation moved to a simple digital currency with all transactions and accounts managed digitally?&nbsp; There would no longer be any physical currency, bill or coin, for use.</em> &nbsp; To be fair, as much as it pains me, some of the proponents only want to do with large denominations above $50 or $100 bills...others however, want all currency removed.&nbsp; His response was truly surprising in its immediacy:  <em>That would be terrible.&nbsp; TERRIBLE if that happened.</em>&nbsp; His first reason was about safety.&nbsp; Events have shown that anything - <em>Dad, ANYTHING can be hacked</em> - could be hacked with sufficient ingenuity and resources and it would be conceivable that everything could be simply gone in a nanosecond.&nbsp; After that comment, he then covered his right eye with his right hand and making an 'O' with his left thumb and index finger, placed them over the left eye.&nbsp; I looked at him blankly and he simply said <em>Big Brother.</em>&nbsp; He didn't want everything to be available for viewing, nor did he want any and all of his transactions to be traceable.&nbsp;That kind of power shouldn't be available to the government nor to the corporations.</p>
<p>Eldest came down later before heading off to work and received the same preface about taking time and then the question, and her response was surprisingly immediate as well.&nbsp; She likewise disliked the notion for the same reason about safety, noting again that anything digital can be hacked.&nbsp; The kids are the products of the online digital age, with a far greater grasp of its benefits and faults that those of us who came of age in the analog era and her first thought went to how all a person's financial eggs shouldn't be kept in one digital basket.&nbsp; As she stood there, her next response was something that I had simply never considered.&nbsp; <em>It would really make it hard for illegal immigrants here, though.</em>&nbsp; When I asked why, she responded <em>None of them have bank accounts and their transactions are usually done in cash because they don't want to bring attention to themselves; then they send the money home via money orders...so it would have a massive impact on immigration.</em>&nbsp; It was then that I recalled that part of her classwork during the semester abroad pertained to studies of immigration, illegal and legal, and that she'd actually had conversations with both immigrants as well as members of the US Border Patrol.&nbsp; The comment about the impact upon illegal immigration was something that I'd never even considered although I expect that the ability to more effectively control illegal immigration would certainly be an argument on behalf of a fully digital currency.</p>
<p>I did have a short conversation about Cyprus and the use of the "bail-in" to manage the bank recapitalization, explaining it briefly to Middle; he confirmed that he understood since he already understood the concept of the bail-out as practiced here in 2008.&nbsp; He commented that it sounded like a <em>socialist</em> thing to do whereupon I asked where the original concept originated; when I told him that it first came about from a combined effort of the <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/about/srac/2012/gsifi.pdf" title="FDIC">FDIC and the Bank of England</a>, his response was concise and rude.&nbsp; Please understand one key point about your status as a retail depositor in a bank:&nbsp; after the financial crisis of 2008, legislation was passed that effectively shifted the status of the retail depositor - you and your kids' bank accounts - from that of a protected entity in the event of the institution's difficulties to that of an unsecured creditor.&nbsp; There is a legal hierarchy in the business world of who has greater risk in the event of bankruptcy and thus stands first in line to lose their money should liquidation be required.&nbsp; In the pre-2008 world, the retail depositor was protected at the rear of the line but the passed legislation now equated the retail depositor to that of an unsecured creditor - someone who simply loaned money to the bank without asking for collateral - and moved you to the head of the line.&nbsp; So even if your bank is small and well-managed, another financial firestorm will put your deposits in the crosshairs should the government move to a bail-in approach.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way...when the Dodd-Frank Bill was passed in 2010 as a response to financial crisis, it made another reclassification.&nbsp; The banking system - predominantly the <em>Too Big To Fail banks</em>- have been heavily involved in highly profitable derivatives trading; that bill shifted the status of derivative counter-parties to that of <em>supercreditor</em> so that they are first in line to receive monies that are redistributed in the event of a bail-in.&nbsp; In other words, we are at the head of the line for liquidation and they are at the head of the other line for reimbursement.&nbsp; Lovely, isn't is?</p>
<p>And that is at the heart of the cashless proposal.&nbsp; The thrust is to move as much money as possible back into the banking system so that in the event of another Lehman style event, there is sufficient capital available to reconstitute the financial system and make good the losses via bail-in before having to go to the government via the bail-out.&nbsp; It is about expanding the number of unsecured creditors and controlling their funds by eliminating their ability to move <em>their</em> money out of the system to protect themselves.&nbsp; The fact that the institutions are never fully protected from digital intrusion and theft is serious; both of the kids are right in that there's always a way to hack the system.&nbsp; But the issue here is purely and simply control, control of assets and control of the redistribution of those assets should worse come to worse.&nbsp; And as to the immigration aspect that Eldest raised:&nbsp; it isn't a key aspect to the proposal but I expect that if this cashless currency proposal gains legs, it will certainly be trotted out as a beneficial side-effect to help control the illegal immigration problem.</p>
<p>The kids aren't stupid, they can see what could happen.&nbsp; But it requires a conscious effort on your part as a parent to periodically pull them out of the Matrix and explain things to them.&nbsp; Do it on car rides, do it at the dinner table, do it in the moments when you might be just sitting together.&nbsp; Create small bits of knowledge as informational pebbles to add to their pile and do so purposefully through the years.&nbsp; There will come a time when they're older that they can begin to take the pile and build structures of their own that might surprise you.&nbsp; That also means that <em>you</em> have to pay attention as well.&nbsp;</content:encoded>

 <title>Cashless America:&nbsp; The Set-Up (Part 1)</title>
 <content:encoded><p>PracticalDad Note:  There's been considerable and increasing talk within the past month about the notion of banning all physical currency.&nbsp; There are plenty of more-experienced than mine with information out there, but this article started as commentary from my two older kids when I explained the digital currency notion to them.&nbsp; The article ultimately became too lengthy and I decided to split it into two parts, the first - this part - being the set-up on the cashless America concept.&nbsp; I'll follow shortly with the take-away from Eldest and Middle in another article with some responses that surprised me.
<p>There have been a spate of articles and interviews within the past several months about the concept of doing away completely with physical currency in the American economy and moving to a purely digital currency.&nbsp; Articles and papers have come forward from several influential sources and in late March, Janet Yellen - the chair of the Federal Reserve - made a comment that questioned whether physical currency such as coins and bills was actually a worthwhile <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/741" title="PracticalDad:  So, Just What is Money?">store of value</a>.&nbsp; It's obviously an idea that's being passed around the Ivory Towers and Hallowed Halls of Power, so certain folks are going to take a run at making this the wave of the future.&nbsp; But radical ideas such as these take time and so I thought that I'd get the input of Eldest and Middle since it's their rising generation that will be affected the most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, Eldest is a rising college senior who has by now not only traveled abroad, but studied abroad as well and is now home to replenish the bank accounts before returning for the final year of college.&nbsp; Middle is her younger sibling, a high school senior who has likewise traveled abroad and is in the midst of AP Economics, much to his chagrin.&nbsp; He initially thought that it would be fun given some of the conversations about money and real world that we've had over the years but now believes - as I do after perusing his text and notes - that it really is not much more than mental masturbation.&nbsp; So the other morning, I asked them to take some time through the course of their day to consider the following question:&nbsp; <em>what would be your thoughts on eliminating all physical currency and moving to a purely digital currency, with transactions managed solely by the use of debit cards?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a moment first to look at what's being proposed.&nbsp; The initial concept was posited by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff in a 2014 paper, <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/c13431.pdf" title="scholar.harvard.edu">Costs and benefits to phasing out currency</a>.&nbsp; According to Rogoff, there are two principal reasons for the gradual and final abolition of physical currency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first goes to providing additional firepower to central banks in their effort to spur inflation to rates of about 2%.&nbsp; A core tenet of present monetary theory is that a moderated inflation - no more than about 2% - is a good thing as gradually rising prices enable producers to continue to hire and pass along rising wages to workers, who then spend that money and help perpetuate what is, in theory, a virtuous cycle.&nbsp; <em>Note:  This is the theory and ignores such real world effects as free-trade globalization, currency pegs/manipulation, and all of the things that actually occur in the real world.</em>&nbsp; As the global economy has tried to recover in the years since the Financial Crisis and the collapse of Lehman - when a monstrous amount of capital was utterly destroyed - the numerous central banks have created a tsunami of liquidity in order to offset deflationary pressures and hopefully create a moderated inflation that meets the core tenet.&nbsp; Deflation is feared because in the experience of the Great Depression, producers lost control of all pricing power and were largely driven out of business, feeding the unemployment as more and more jobs were eliminated.&nbsp; But we've since gone through an extended number of years of <a href="http://www.rooseveltinstitute.org/new-roosevelt/zirp" title="Rooseveltinstitute.org">Zero Interest Rate Policy, aka <em>ZIRP</em></a> and the ability of the central banks to use interest rates as an effective tool against this deflationary environment is reaching what is referred to the <em>effective lower bound</em>.&nbsp; In terms that any kid taking AP Economics would learn is that there is no longer any marginal value to changes in rates, although certain European nations and the EU are pursuing <em>Negative Interest Rate Policy</em> as the banks are now charged by the central banks for keeping deposits.&nbsp; The concept behind this stunning bizarro policy - which thoroughly upends literally millenia of conventional wisdom touting the value of saving - is that spending must be spurred and money must not be kept as savings, but instead forced out into the economy in order to be spent and spur economic activity.&nbsp; </p>
<p><em>Understand a central concept here:&nbsp; a dollar bill is not just called currency, but also referred to in econo-speak as a "Zero-Interest Negotiable Bond".&nbsp; It is a piece of paper that pays the bearer absolutely no interest whatsoever but can be easily traded from one user to another in the course of daily economic life.&nbsp; The upshot is that as interest rates approach zero, there is no longer any real impetus to keep money in the bank but instead, to just go ahead and keep it under the mattress or even use it in lieu of credit cards which actually have high rates when contrasted with the rates available for various savings products.&nbsp; But as rates not only approach zero but actually go below zero into negative interest territory - in reality, where the banks are presently charged for keeping money on deposit and have simply not yet passed that cost onto the retail depositor - then the average person will conceivably ignore the banking system and save money by simply removing their money from the banks completely.&nbsp; The upshot is that a larger percentage of total money is then outside of the banking system and beyond control of the central banks, even further lessening the tools that they have to affect the economy.</em></p>
<p>The second aspect of the Rogoff proposal is that an outsize proportion of illegal and/or unreportable-tax transactions are handled via physical currency.&nbsp; Pay cash for a used vehicle for instance, but report a smaller amount than actually paid via cash in order to mitigate state sales tax when title is transferred; because there's no actual check to serve as documentation, cash can conceivably hide money from the tax coffers.&nbsp; So eliminating all physical currency transactions means that all transactions thus occur within a monitorable system, eliminating the prospect of illegality and tax fraud.&nbsp; The sop to this aspect is the same sop to critics of electronic domestic surveillance - this would only affect criminals and cheats and honest, law-abiding citizens would have no worry since they're doing nothing wrong.&nbsp: Given the weaponization of such agencies as the IRS, I'm not certain that I'm the least bit comfortable with that surmise.</p>
<p>There's another aspect of this that bothers me, and that pertains to the financial solution to the Cyprus banking crisis of several years ago.&nbsp; As a recap, the Cypriot banking system - a favorite offshore banking location for wealthy Russian oligarchs - ran into problems and was on the verge of collapse.&nbsp; But instead of a government sponsored bailout as in the US, circa 2008, the Cypriot government pushed through a "bail-in" in which bank depositors were forced to give up a portion of their deposits to help keep the banks afloat.&nbsp; In their ideal world, the hit would've been on the large Russian depositors with smaller depositors saved but in our present system, in which the uber-wealthy have access to cash and information, the Russians had largely removed their funds by the time that knife fell and while the smallest depositors were exempted, the original targets had all moved onwards to safer grazing territory.&nbsp; This might sound faintly interesting but for the realization that the "bail-in" concept was originally floated by the FDIC, the US governmental agency tasked with insuring bank deposits.&nbsp; The notion was that there had to be a better way than just spending more government money and that better way was found with the depositors.&nbsp; So bear with me here:  if you're worried about the bank on a very short term basis, as happens during a good, old-fashioned bank run, your option is to pull out the money as cash and keep it safe under the mattress.&nbsp; But if there's a cashless society, then the only place to move your money is to another institution since there would be currency.&nbsp; You are, in effect, effectively trapped within a system that could decide it was better off to use the depositors money in the form of a "bail-in" of teetering banks.&nbsp; And if you think that the pain would be spread amongst everyone, remember that the uber-wealthy depositors in Cyprus had most of their money removed by the time that the ball dropped on the bail-in.&nbsp;

 <title>Kids and the Public Use of Cellphones</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Tonight was an interesting evening since my better half and I had dinner at the restaurant at which both Eldest and Middle work.&nbsp; The fact that they literally work side by side as head hostess and host is fascinating enough as she will be training him, but when they were out of sight doing their jobs, I took the opportunity to watch the other diners; I am a natural observer spawned by spending childhood vacation evenings seated on boardwalk benches because my folks wouldn't pay for ride tickets.&nbsp; But what grabbed my attention was visual proof of the cellphone spread discussed in multiple newspaper and magazine articles.</p>
<p>Across the way from our outside table was a large group of almost a dozen people, mixed between girls in their mid-teens and middle-aged men.&nbsp; I'm 99.999% certain that they were father/daughter combinations but knowing that there's a large swingers group that meets for a monthly social hour at this restaurant - and boy howdy, ain't that an educational conversation with the kids - I'll hold the .001% in reserve.&nbsp; What was notable however was the prevalence of smartphones and cellphones in active use amongst the group and not just among the girls.&nbsp; The girls would share their smartphones back and forth, taking selfies and ostensibly trolling the web as they waited.&nbsp; But I was surprised to see multiple adults also pull their devices to answer and/or make calls, or likewise swipe their screens.&nbsp; It's not uncommon for large groups seated in restaurants to break into smaller conversational nodes because the ambient noise makes it difficult for one end of the table to hear the other, but this scene was played out amongst other tables which had far fewer diners.&nbsp; It was honestly depressing to see people turn away from one another to answer texts or swipe screens to follow whatever on the available wi-fi network.</p>
<p>So how does affect the family and kids?&nbsp; There have certainly been moments in our household when any one of us - and even Youngest now has a basic phone - has reached into a pocket to glance at something incoming; it happened to me yesterday in a meeting.&nbsp; But that's a function of the press of other responsibilities and commitments and even teens with jobs and activities have them.&nbsp; But pulling out the phone to glance and then replacing it isn't the same thing as the wholesale process of ignoring your table companions, a tacit insult if ever there was one.&nbsp; We've been clear since kids' cell phones were first introduced into the house that they had no place at the family dinner table and we've tried to hold the line on that, even if one of them still will periodically pull it out to respond quickly to something that's incoming.&nbsp; It's an ongoing and chronic occurrence but at least it's not a wholesale conversation and when a comment is made about it, there's no rancorous response.&nbsp; I know of families who require that all cell phones be removed before dinner in order to maintain balance and assure that there's an opportunity to engage in even a short period of uninterrupted conversation, free of distraction.&nbsp; The flip side to this is that you have to be willing to purposefully put away your own device so that you're abiding by the rule as well.&nbsp; There have been moments in my parenting experience when I've responded to <em>but you don't follow that rule</em> with the <em>I'm your father, I don't always have to </em> response but it seems to me that this is one of those rules that should be universally respected.&nbsp; The sole exceptions in the household are my Better Half, who is a physician and subject to any number of situations requiring immediate attention and the common awareness of everyone that there's an illness in a member of the extended family, particularly the elderly relatives.&nbsp; If those aren't operative however, then the usual reminder is to put the devices away.</p>
<p>There's value in upholding the rules about cellphones here.&nbsp; There's tremendous value in knowing how to hold and maintain a conversation with another person as well as like value in being able to follow a thought process without distraction.&nbsp; The challenges facing our country are numerous, deep and varied and if the kids aren't capable of thinking with clarity, depth and focus, then the situations will grow insoluble, at least in a manner that's satisfactory to a democracy with a functioning constitution.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - May 2015:&nbsp; Food Price Declines Resume</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The May 2015 pricing for the PracticalDad Price Index was finished the other day and after a month in which the decline ceased, May showed a major resumption of the Index's drop.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="practicaldad.com">basket's</a> Total Index for May 2015 stood at 107.56, a decrease from April's Total Index of 108.21 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; But the 37 foodstuff item Food-Only Sub-Index dropped precipitously from April's 110.20 to May's 107.74 (November 2010 = 100); were it not for an outlying 43% increase in the average price of a box of non-food kitchen trash bags, the Total Index would also have dropped more precipitously from April's level.</p>
<p>For a better perspective on what's happening with the marketbasket - particularly the foodstuffs such as meat, dairy and produce - consider this about the Food-Only Sub-Index.&nbsp; It took four years and a month for the Food-Only Sub-Index of 37 items to rise to it's highest point in December, 2014.&nbsp; At that time, it stood at it's apex level of 115.13 (November 2010 = 100), so that the same basket of 37 separate food items had risen by 15.13% from the baseline in November 2010.&nbsp; Within a period of five consecutive months, that sub-index's rise has fully collapsed by almost one half - 48.9% to be precise - to point at which the most recent sub-index reading in May, 2015 stood at only 7.74% higher than the baseline composite level in November 2010.&nbsp; So five months of declines in the sub-index have positively wiped away about three years of price increases in both the Total Index and the Food-Only Sub-Index.</p>
<p>What's happening?&nbsp; There are 47 commonly used grocery store items within the overall marketbasket, of which 37 items are actually foodstuffs - meat, breads, dairy, produce, staples, etc - and it's among the foodstuffs that the prices are declining.&nbsp; From April to May of 2015, 14 of the 37 foodstuff items - more than one-third - had declines in prices with the average price decline being 4.97% and the median price decline at 2.55%.&nbsp; There were only five items in the entire basket with price increases; the average price rise of the five items was 10.24% but the median price rise was only 2.6% due to an outlying price increase of 43% for one particular item at one of the three surveyed stores.&nbsp; If this outlier was removed, the average price increase would have been only 2.05%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What has been notable is the activity within two of the three surveyed - and completely unrelated - grocery stores.&nbsp; One is an independent single supermarket but affiliated with a national supplier that provides the store-brand items for independent supermarkets.&nbsp; That market has, within the past three months, shifted to a new supplier that provides the store-brand items under a different label than before and there have been price drops in multiple surveyed foodstuff items with this supplier's introduction.&nbsp; The other supermarket is owned by an international chain with stores throughout the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and this whole store is now in the process of introducing a more aggressive "Every Day Low Prices" policy with price declines in multiple foodstuff items.&nbsp; <em><ul>The long and short of this is that as incomes continue to erode and increasing numbers of Americans receive governmental food assistance, the grocers are engaging in much more aggressive price competition to survive in a business with very thin profit margins.&nbsp; Each of these two has access to considerable negotiating leverage with wholesale producers and are using it in order to keep sales moving.&nbsp; They've tried to differentiate between themselves with coffee kiosks and upgraded facilities, but the ongoing economic decline is rendering these moot and it's now coming down to bare-knuckle pricing to survive.&nbsp; The third store is a regional chain with less negotiating power since it simply doesn't have the cumulative customer base and it's this store that first went to price competition over a year ago; it's this store that's now unable to keep pace with its two competitors in the survey pricing.</ul></em>
<p>Prices of individual items will rise and fall for a multitude of reasons.&nbsp; Supply and demand, as with meat and dairy.&nbsp; Commodity increases and decreases due to hot money flows, such as with sugar and coffee.&nbsp; Seasonality, such as with eggs.&nbsp; This was why I began to monitor food prices as part of a comprehensive marketbasket in November of 2010; it was to try to look at the notion of inflation/deflation as a whole and in this whole, the recent actions of the grocers are strongly indicative of a broadly deflationary move.&nbsp; The principal reason that the Federal Reserve and government are terrified of deflation, as last experienced in the Great Depression, was that companies were ultimately unable to control their pricing with the collapse in spending.&nbsp; They consequently went bankrupt as their sales disappeared and what we're now seeing in a localized section of the country is a replay of that scenario as grocers descend to bare-knuckles pricing tactics to maintain sales in an increasingly harsh business environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here are the monthly results for the PracticalDad Price Index.</p>

 <title>Discussing Surveillance with the Kids:&nbsp; What If It&#8217;s Not McGee?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>My biggest job as a father is to help raise the kids to take their place as moral and productive adults in society, not necessarily a simple job in today's America.&nbsp; Doing that requires, amongst many other things, an awareness of the issues that face Americans with an emphasis on those that will particularly affect them as they proceed along in life.&nbsp; One of the issues that most concerns me for the kids is that of the presence of government surveillance, particularly the pervasive electronic programs fostered by the NSA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is troubling for many reasons but there are two points that particularly bother me in regards to the kids.&nbsp; The first is that they are so massively tied in to the ether via the internet and increasingly through the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/08/telescreen/" title="techcrunch.com">newly termed "Sensornet"</a>, the increasing number of interconnected devices.&nbsp; An entity with the resources - and boy howdy, the NSA has those in terabytes - can carefully craft together an accurate picture of an individual's beliefs, likes, dislikes and opinions for the highest bidder; in the aspect of a free society, it can also be used to apply pressure to silence an uncomfortable opinion.&nbsp; The second point is that the news-media is largely now controlled by no more than a half-dozen corporate entities and with the rise of corporate fascism within the past two decades or so, there are fewer and fewer places for these youngsters to go for truly independent news.&nbsp; While it's impossible to eliminate full bias from any news source, there are now far greater and lucrative reasons to assert control over the news flow and corporations are generally not run by people who are willing to place their companies and paychecks at risk.&nbsp; The rise of the terrorist threat - whether it's that everpresent or just another straw bogeyman to be conveniently exploited - means that there's a plethora of opportunities for the media to push a specific message, which is about the need for security and increasing vigilance that begins to conflict with our most core freedoms.</p>
<p>So if it's my job to prepare the kids and make them aware, I have to look for any opportunity to create a teachable moment.&nbsp; Such was the moment some months ago after we spent a Tuesday evening watching <em>NCIS</em>.&nbsp; It was another of those episodes in which Gibbs' team is against the wall trying to defuse a potential terrorist plot and McGee realizes that he can surreptiously crack some firewalls and obtain crucial data that makes the plot stoppable.&nbsp; There's the nod to legal process with the warning that this could be a problem without warrant, but Gibbs and/or Vance will quietly nod and then make a cryptic remark that is in itself an approval of the measure.&nbsp; My full disclosure is that I like <em>NCIS</em> and have watched it for years, developing an affection for the characters, most particularly the wiseass DiNozzo.&nbsp; But after that episode, I engaged Youngest in a conversation after he'd gone online at the family computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The brief talk - and it can't take huge amounts of time - centered on what the team did to crack the case.&nbsp; <em>Here's my problem with it,</em> I said.&nbsp; <em>Did they crack the case?</em>&nbsp; Youngest responded that they had, to which I asked <em>what if that wasn't McGee at the terminal?</em>&nbsp; <em>What if that was someone else, someone that you didn't necessarily know and trust?&nbsp; Would that make what they did the right thing to do?</em> Youngest - now in seventh grade - has had enough conversations to understand the notion of legal process and could see that the process had been upended in the interest of public safety.&nbsp; But my subsequent conversation with him went to the need for the process in the first place.&nbsp; I pointed out the recent issues with the IRS, specifically in regards to using it as a political tool against libertarians and conservatives, as well as the Obama Administration's vicious war against whistleblowers, who often were moral people who were trying to shed light on abuses within the system and not incompetents or malcontents.&nbsp; It might seem heady stuff for a middle-schooler, but the reality is that the kids are generally capable of understanding topics if you've raised them to "play up" in conversations and have tried to make them as understandable and matter-of-fact as possible.&nbsp; There have been times with my own kids when they've asked questions on the spur and I've told them that I'll come back to them after having a chance to think about it.&nbsp; It isn't that I don't know the facts or have an opinion on it, but that I need a little time to think through how to present an answer that's understandable for the age level; that said, there have been a few instances where I've gone back to fact-check myself so I don't come off sounding like a moron (not a hard thing to do sometimes).&nbsp; One or two days later, I've come back with <em>Remember that question you had about...?</em></p>
<p>The point to the conversation was to at least give Youngest a glimpse into the issue of government surveillance, that there was more there than just a friendly fictional scout-leading character on a popular television show who could be upending the process.&nbsp; It was also to give him a sense that the legal processes are there for solid reasons and that the technology can be a double-edged sword, to protect the common person from the vagaries and senses of the poltical operatives and hacks that populate the upper levels of the various bureaucracies, willing and able to abuse the system for the ends of themselves or the hands that feed them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been other situations that have arisen since then that have led to further conversations on the question of privacy and surveillance and both my wife and I have pointed them out to one or more of the kids as they've been around.&nbsp; The point is to make yourself aware of the issues in our society and whenever possible, find a way to present them to the kids so that they have a grounding as they grow.&nbsp; These are the years that will allow them to begin developing the habits that protect them when they're finally adults and my expectation is that America is going to have a moment of truth about how far the security apparatus should go in the pursuit of security.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - April 2015</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The April 2015 PracticalDad Price Index was completed and compiled in the first days of April and the results show that - for now, at least - the collapse in the marketbasket prices from December 2014 through March 2015 have stabilized, increasing slightly from March.&nbsp; April's Total Index for the 47 item PracticalDad Marketbasket stabilized at 108.21 (November 2010 = 100), up from March 2015's Total Index reading of 107.89.&nbsp; The 37 foodstuff items that comprise the Food-Only Index in April stood at 110.20 (November 2010 = 100), up slightly from March's reading of 109.50.&nbsp; Note that especially regarding the 37 foodstuff items (for a complete list, see <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index - November 2010">here</a>), the drop over the four months from December 2014 through March 2015 accounted for fully 37% of the index rise over the previous four year period since the Index's inception in November 2010.</p>
<p>What arrested the decline was the increase in the seven item Meats category, as four of the items rose at an average clip of 9.5% from the previous month.&nbsp; Surprisingly, a pound of 80% ground beef remained stable at $4.32 while chicken, deli ham and hot dogs rose significantly.&nbsp; When you remove these four increases, there was an equal number of price increases and decreases (6 each) amongst the remainder of the marketbasket items.&nbsp; Given that the meat category is highly affected by the effects of supply issues, especially <a href="https://www.aasv.org/aasv%20website/Resources/Diseases/PorcineEpidemicDiarrhea.php" title="American Assn of Swine Veterinarians">PED</a> and the drought, a cursory removal of those supply issues would indicate that the remainder of the 47 item basket indicates that deflation continues to prevail in the economy.</p>
<p>Since deflation is precisely what the Federal Reserve is working to stop, it's helpful to look at what the monthly pricing excursions and results are showing.&nbsp; Understand that what scares businesses and the Federal Reserve so much about deflation is that it erodes and destroys a business' ability to maintain and control its own pricing structure; money flows from the economy, leaving people with less and the consequent result is that businesses must continually cut their own prices to maintain sales.&nbsp; Let's take a look at the workings of the monthly pricing to gauge this.&nbsp; I price at three separate and unrelated grocery stores:  one owned by an international grocery corporation, another owned by a regional American chain and finally, a fully independent grocer.&nbsp; Because one of the original tenets of the index is that the cost-conscious buyer will purchase store-brands whenever possible, a significant portion of the marketbasket is composed of store-brand items.&nbsp; As money continues to flow out of the Main Street economy and the middle class is winnowed away, sales volume declines and prices decrease in order to maintain sales.&nbsp; The news that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-14/americans-spending-on-dining-out-just-overtook-grocery-sales-for-the-first-time-ever" title="bloomberg.com">for the first time, restaurant sales were larger than grocery sales</a> nationally means that there is now additional pressure on grocers; forty years ago, they competed with one another and starting maybe a decade ago, they had to begin competing with Walmart as well.&nbsp; Now they have to compete with restaurants as the younger generation shifts its spending back to inexpensive dining out instead of cooking.&nbsp; Given that more and more of the Millenials are now having to live at home with the parents - a largely unwelcome event - they are gathering together to eat out instead of sitting in the old family kitchen spending even more time with the 'rents.&nbsp; The upshot is that while there are certainly situations which lead to price increases, such as the diminished supply of the national cattle herds, the composite activity indicates that overall, deflation is occurring.&nbsp; Amongst the three sampled stores, the most substantial price decreases occur in the internationally owned store, followed by the independent grocer and then the regional chain bringing up the rear.&nbsp; What does this suggest?&nbsp; As with Walmart, the international chain is able to order and purchase in significant enough quantities that it can force producers to accept lower revenues.&nbsp; Although the independent grocer is a small one-store operation, it is also affiliated with a national generic brand that supplies an untold number of independent stores across the country with a substantial purchasing power.&nbsp; Because the regional chain simply doesn't have enough stores, it is unable to command such and the result is that the store's marketbasket prices are generally higher each month.&nbsp; I can also attest from anecdotal evidence and observation - buttressed by a periodic review of the financial media, that this regional firm is suffering from greater financial difficulties than its two competitors.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As a commenter from <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com" title="Calculated Risk">Calculated Risk</a> once noted about deflation several years ago:  <em>In the early days of the Depression, a candy bar cost a nickel.  By 1931, you could get three candy bars for a dime and by 1933, nobody had a dime.</em>&nbsp; So money is flowing away from the real economy as we speak and while some prices increase due to true demand and supply, prices are dropping on a composite basis.&nbsp; We'll have to see how long this can continue.</p>

 <title>The House That Barney Built</title>
 <content:encoded><p>If you're a father, pay attention (obviously) to what you hear and find a meaningful tagline that you can come back to again and again with the kids in order to make a point.&nbsp; It's a recurrent phrase or short sentence that makes a point, a rhetorical bumper sticker that you can - with sufficient repetition - hopefully tack onto the kid's mental bumper for further use as he or she goes through life.&nbsp; Such a phrase that I've adopted for the past eight years is <em>The house that Barney built</em>.
<p>The phrase is meaningless for anybody else out there and even for two of my own kids, but it's a phrase that has significant meaning for Middle, who first heard it while in fourth grade and then shared it with me one evening after he heard it.&nbsp; Middle is an arts person, an individual who finds greater meaning in e.e. cummings than in how to perform algebra.&nbsp; He's now en route to his freshman year in college to pursue a degree in the performing arts and our response, after a deep breath, is to encourage him and support him in this pursuit.&nbsp; That said, it was clear years ago that he'd follow this kind of path and I subsequently made it a point to discuss the practical and monetary side of that kind of life to help clarify what issues and life he might encounter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phrase <em>The house that Barney built</em> was something said to him in his first stage production.&nbsp; After years of requests, we acquiesced in his fourth grade year to let him audition for a professional stage production of <em>Oliver!</em> and to our pleasure, he made the cast.&nbsp; The role of Fagin was played by a professional actor named Barry Pearl, and he was - from everything we heard from Middle and others - a wonderful person with whom to work; he also portrayed a great Fagin.&nbsp; But through the various evening practices, he'd find time to chat with the other cast members and impart some professional knowledge to the youngsters, many of whom were enthralled with the notion of performing on stage.&nbsp; As Middle related to me later that evening on the way home from rehearsal, Pearl had engaged in a conversation on the practical aspects of acting, most especially the handling of money.&nbsp; Earlier in his career, he'd been cast as a regular on <a href="http://www.barney.com/usa/" title="Barney.com">Barney</a> as Professor Tinkerputt and it gave him a steady income for a period of years.&nbsp; It was during this stint that he took the money that he'd made and put it to paying for a house, a place that he'd be able to reside without having to worry about constantly having to handle a mortgage with what can be a problematic cashflow between acting gigs.&nbsp; He described it to the group as <em>the house that Barney built</em> and it was a phrase that struck Middle enough that he related it to me verbatim that evening.&nbsp; Since I'm always on the lookout for taglines that support the lessons that I'm trying to teach - and there are certain taglines for each - this was a wonderful turn of phrase that I immediately put away for future reference.</p>
<p>The phrase is a wonderfully curt response to the want/need confusion that's been perfected through the past four or so decades by the Madison Avenue apostles.&nbsp; Our children - hell, sometimes even us - have fallen to the notion that you can indeed have it all and that the want is sometimes as important as the need.&nbsp; If you don't necessarily have the assets available to get what you want, you can always borrow a bit more to get it and that way lies the path to debt servitude.&nbsp; After all, the financial press noted some years ago in a moment of drink-the-kool-aid idiocy that <em>credit is the new liquidity</em>.&nbsp; The reality is that's akin to ignoring your own tap when you want a drink of water and instead spending your own money to purchase that water.&nbsp; <em>No, wait...never mind.</em>&nbsp; That's how far along on the crazy train we've now come, something unrecognizable to our great-grandparents' generation.</p>
<p>It's a phrase that isn't used often, but has been trotted out through the ensuing years as we've talked.&nbsp; It was the other Saturday morning that it finally made it's way out again as he and I sat in the living room with cups of coffee and talked money.&nbsp; Recently, it seems as if that's sometimes all I discuss and it's unfortunate that it appears that way.&nbsp; But my point in the discussion was that he was entering a profession that while it could be immensely fulfilling, it could also be financially insecure.&nbsp; I believe that the present system - monetary and political - is insupportable and that the change will certainly occur in the next number of years.&nbsp; I also believe that while the word <em>change</em> comes across on a page as a sterile, unexciting event, the reality will be far more fearful and problematic and that belief colors what I want the kids to learn; after all, my job is ultimately to prepare them to make their way in the world as productive and moral adults and that's not necessarily what the general system seems to want to teach the kids.</p>
<p>Decide what the most important lessons that you want your children to learn.&nbsp; Spend time in conversation with them as much as possible when they're younger because once they begin to plug into the matrix, your window for discussion with them will narrow considerably.&nbsp; Decide on your tagline, that rhetorical bumper-sticker that you return to again and again and if it's from somebody or somewhere else that has an impact on them, then don't worry about ownership but grab it and stuff in your bag-of-tricks for reference.&nbsp; Because someday, that might be all that you need to say in a pinch to get a point across.</p>

 <title>The Saint Paddy&#8217;s Pub Crawl (How Much Should a Father Reveal?)</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There are opportunities for conversation and discussion at all corners, and the other morning was a prime example of such.&nbsp; Middle had to attend a theatre audition at an urban university and we took the opportunity to take the train since, if he does attend there, it will be the standard mode of travel.&nbsp; It was during the 70 minute trip that we encountered college students en route to Philadelphia for an early start to their long-awaited Saint Patrick's Day Pub Crawl and their entry raised the parental question, <em>how much do I reveal about my own youth</em>?</p>
<p>The first indication of the Crawl was the entry of a half dozen people, a mixture of college and post-college adults.&nbsp; One of them carried a bag and they sat quietly and in a moment, a young man picked up his backpack and entered the vacant restroom.&nbsp; A moment later, the Kelly Green Power Ranger, replete with helmet, exited and returned to his seat amidst laughter from both his friends and other passengers.&nbsp; We noted that there then appeared green cans of beer to be quietly passed around amongst the crew.&nbsp; These were followed at the next station by another group of young adults, obviously in college.&nbsp; The students, primarily young women, were carrying convenience store coffee cups but it was the <em>*clink*</em> of a canvas bag carried by one of them that clued us to the fact that the cups had long since been emptied of coffee, if they'd ever carried coffee in the first place.&nbsp; The girls/women  weren't unduly loud but the next indication of the general condition came when the conductor stopped at the seats just ahead of us and asked the occupants for their tickets.&nbsp; One of the two seated ahead asked, giggling, <em>Is this the Polar Express?</em> &nbsp; The middle-aged conductor's deadpan response was <em>Would you like me to punch "believe" in your ticket?</em> as he punched away.&nbsp; A moment later, I glanced over at Middle as we chatted and elbowed him, nodding for him to also glance over to see the two women across the aisle refilling their cups with Miller and Landshark respectively.&nbsp; At least one of them had a discriminating taste, although it wasn't likely to mean squat in another six hours.&nbsp; <em>Welcome to college</em> was my sotto voce remark in Middle's ear.</p>
<p>The two of us chuckled and quietly chatted as the topic turned to drinking.&nbsp; There's no doubt that there's going to be a serious amount of alcohol available, even more than is already available to high school students today, and all that I can do as a father is to find a consistent message and stay on it.&nbsp; My message has been that you're simply going to be in situations in which it's available and I hope - and expect - that you'll remember that there are consequences to poor decisions.&nbsp; This was followed by two addendum:&nbsp; the first addendum being that if he ever needed a bad guy upon which to place responsibility or blame with his friends, he should feel free to use my name as liberally as necessary.&nbsp; The second addendum was that if he ever found himself in any situation, don't be afraid to pick up the phone and call me immediately, and that included his friends as well.&nbsp; Middle is aware that many universities are taking a hard line towards alcohol and imposing penalties towards students who are found drinking and/or drunk in the dorms and this reminder was again passed along as well.&nbsp; One of his older buddies commented that he didn't even make it through the first night on campus his freshman year before the campus police entered his dorm room and arrested the roommate for underaged drinking.</p>
<p>But it was in the next moment that Middle popped the question, <em>Did you ever get drunk in college?</em> and it's a moment for which every father should be prepared as the kids grow.&nbsp; I'm fortunate that I could honestly say <em>No, buzzed several times but never out-and-out drunk.&nbsp; I saw others drunk and hated the notion that if drunk, I was passing my judgment and responsibility for my own safety to others, who even if they weren't drunk, might not necessarily be my friends and interested in my safety as much as their own entertainment.</em>&nbsp; Four years at a university known even then for hard-drinking and I'd been privy to enough debauchery to detest being at another's mercy and whim.&nbsp; As dangerous as that can be, it's made worse decades later by the presence of smartphone cameras and social media, used to spread and memorialize the drunk's embarrassment.</p>
<p>Drinking and drug usage are just later variants of the question, which is liable to cross your child's lips even in preschool.&nbsp; So decide early on, how much are you willing to share?&nbsp; Do you prefer to downplay and distract them, if they're young enough, with other topics (and that is certainly a possibility)?&nbsp; Do you choose to acknowledge misbehaviors - and we all have them - in a general sense or do you explore them when they're old enough?&nbsp; Do you simply not respond and let the kids wonder?&nbsp; This last was my own father's approach and the company line was that he was always on the straight and narrow.&nbsp; It was when I reached my own college years that he began to share stories from his own youth and I was flummoxed to find that there were periods when he couldn't have followed the straight and narrow with a yardstick and a magnifying glass.&nbsp; <em>Christ, compared to this guy, I'm a friggin' saint...where did I go right and how much fun did I miss?</em> &nbsp; When I asked him why he never revealed anything until I was in college, he grinned sheepishly and commented something to the effect that if I'd done some of his (mis)deeds, he probably would have killed me.&nbsp; His job as a father, he said, was to be an example.</p>
<p> And he was correct, the disingenuous bastard.</p>
<p>One friend is also an older father and has been very open with his own kids about his early years, which were far hairier than my own.&nbsp; But they also understand the ways in which things can go wrong by dint of Dad's mistakes and he is secure enough to dissect his own situations with them, giving them a heads-up on their peers who don't have the parental sharing.&nbsp; The technology base might change, but the youthful errors remain the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So take some time to think about how much of your own past you choose to share with the kids?&nbsp; Do you handle it as a novelist, ascribing some of your own experiences to a fictitious buddy that the kids can never meet because <em>he-was-such-a-great-guy-it's-a-damned-shame-that-he's-dead</em> and use the experiences to teach and entertain?&nbsp; Do you take my friend's route and share the stories openly, using them as examples of how things can go wrong and what not to do?&nbsp; Or do you take my father's route and go silent, talking to them but trusting that nothing stupid is going to happen?&nbsp; The questions will come and begin after the kids begin talking, so the sooner that you have your approach, the better off you're going to be.&nbsp; Because the kids can sniff out hypocrisy like a hound looking for his favorite bone.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - March 2015:&nbsp; Cliff-Diving in the Supermarket</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The pricing for the March 2015 version of the 47 item PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket was completed and the results were frankly surprising.&nbsp; The Total Index of <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">47 items</a> declined by 1.33 points to March's level of 108.09 (November 2010 = 100) while the Food-Only Sub-Index of the 37 Foodstuff items dropped by 2.19 points (November 2010 = 100) to 109.89 from February.&nbsp; This is the largest single monthly decline in the Food-Only Sub-Index since the inception of the project in November 2010 and is a <em>34% decline in that category since it's peak at 115.13 only four months previously</em>.</p>
<p>So where has this cratering occurred in the past four months?&nbsp; Despite the understanding that there had been issues in the supply chain for dairy products and meats due to drought-related effects, these are apparently passing as the Meat and Dairy categories declined from the December 2014 peak by 7.43% and 7.41% respectively with most the change occurring during January and February.&nbsp; Most of the declines occurred during those two months as the category changes showed much smaller declines in the one month period of February through March.&nbsp; The four item Household Products category (bath soap, aluminum foil, kitchen trash bags and paper towels) declined by 7.15% since the December 2014 peak with the majority of the decline taking place in the one month period of February through March 2015.&nbsp;In the case of the Meat category, much of the change occurred as grocers found new suppliers for ham and chicken, driving the prices down since the peak by 24.3% and 14.3% respectively.&nbsp; Eggs also declined by 17.5% over the four month period.&nbsp; In the Dairy category, a gallon of 2% milk dropped by 14.9% and butter by 21.5% over the same four month period, although the changes were dispersed across all of the grocers instead of localized to one or another grocer as new suppliers were found.</p>
<p>So here are the Indices results for the past six months.<p>

 <title>Conversations with the Kids:&nbsp; Corporations and Privacy</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Serendipity reigns supreme.&nbsp; Last week was the rather sudden purchase of a new, larger screen LED television to replace our smaller and older model and after bouncing back and forth among retailers, we purchased a Samsung that honestly does have a breathtaking picture; it's impressive enough that the family pulled out the director's cut of <em>Lord of the Rings:  Return of the King</em> over the weekend to watch it again for the umpteenth time.&nbsp; Yet several days after it's purchase, I came across a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com" title="www.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/08/telescreen/" title="article">article</a> that took a different look at the new Samsung Smart TV.</p>
<p>The Techcrunch writer noted that someone with the Electronic Frontier Foundation actually took the time to read Samsung's privacy policy for the new voice-command Smart Television and found the following passage within it:&nbsp; <em>In addition, Samsung may collect and your device may capture voice commands and associated texts so that we can provide you with Voice Recognition features and evaluate and improve the features.&nbsp; Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured and transmitted to a third party through your use of Voice Recognition.&nbsp;</em>So the upshot is that if you program your television to use the voice commands, you'll have to remember that what you're saying is going to a third party; you'll also have to censor yourself lest truly personal information - and as families will spend time in front of the television, truly personal information can be discussed - make it to an unknown third party entity, who will at the very least, add it to the mass of information already out there for data mining.</p>
<p>The article's contents have already been discussed with the kids and my wife, who is likewise glad that we opted out of voice recognition.&nbsp; The message to Middle and Youngest is that the loss of privacy now extends beyond the internet itself.&nbsp; As society opts for the ease-of-use with a wider and wider range of inter-connected devices, <em>aka <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/11/the-rise-of-the-sensornet-4-9bn-connected-things-in-2015-says-gartner/" title="techcrunch.com">the sensornet</a></em>, it should expect that the insidious price for the ease factor is the ongoing and increasing loss of privacy as more and more personal information is mined and gathered to add to the data profile for each individual.&nbsp; It's an especially troublesome consideration for a generation that has grown up online, willing to share an amazing amount of personal information with a wide variety of people on an extended number of social network platforms.&nbsp; So the kids had better become aware now, even if they don't yet appreciate the potential for trouble that such an invasion of privacy could create.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; Deflation Winning in February 2015</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies of the past several years have been intended to spur a mild deflation in the hopes that it kick-starts underlying real economic activity.&nbsp; It has also led to an ongoing debate about whether we're going to see real inflation or the dreaded - at least to the central banks - deflation instead.&nbsp; On the street level, it's hard to see exactly what's going on as fees increase and the price of a gallon of gas rolls around at a 20 cent clip over the course of a single week.&nbsp; So since November 2010, I've tracked the cost of <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">a 47 item grocery marketbasket</a> at three separate grocery stores that might be purchased by a theoretical family.&nbsp; On the street level, deflation is winning out and in February 2015 delivered a quality body slam to the inflationary expectations crowd as the Total Index of the 47 items dropped from January's 111.32 (November 2010 = 100) to February's 109.42.&nbsp; There's a Food-Only Sub-index of 37 foodstuff items within the basket and that component saw a similar drop of 1.92 points (January's 114 to February's 112.08) over the same period.&nbsp; This is akin to cliff-diving when you consider that the 37 item Sub-Index was at an all-time high of 115.13 in December 2014, only two months ago.&nbsp; So over a two month period, the Sub-Index has dropped by more than 3 full points.</p>
<p>So where is the activity happening?</p>
<p>First, there was a bit of a head fake in January when one of the grocery stores saw a price spike of more than a third in their store-brand eight-roll packs of paper towels, which contributed to the Total Index rise that month.&nbsp; However, this same store saw a newer, slightly different store-brand eight-roll package in February at a price akin to the first price while the original eight-roll package was still available at the higher price.&nbsp; Since my standing rule over five years has been, when such occurs, to go with the lesser cost item as the majority of cost-conscious consumers on a budget would, I opted to now use this lesser-priced item in lieu of the more expensive option.&nbsp; My suspicion is that this lesser priced package is of lesser quality and an example of <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/701" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  Presenting Stealth Deflation">stealth deflation</a>.</p>
<p>From a foodstuff basis, there have been significant price declines in the cost of certain basic foods.&nbsp; Since December 2014, the price of a gallon of 2% milk has dropped from $4.22 to $3.74 (11.4%) and the price of a dozen large eggs has also dropped from $2.62 to $1.99 (24%).&nbsp; The price of a pound of sliced cooked deli ham also declined from $6.16 to $5.99 over the two month period.&nbsp; I was expecting to see a more significant drop in the price of commodity related items such as sugar, canola oil (which is also used for biofuel and linked in price movement to that of oil), coffee and aluminum foil but that didn't pan out as only coffee saw a minor price decrease over that period.</p>
<p>So what is the upshot?&nbsp; From my perspective in the grocery aisles, deflation and falling prices are generally taking hold.&nbsp; There might be actual increases due to legitimate supply and demand issues such as the western US drought, but the inflationary policy is losing out,&nbsp; Bigtime.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>The Messages From the Super Bowl</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Just like the tens of millions of other American households, we had friends over last night to watch the game.&nbsp; And like millions of other households whose teams were not in the contest, we were watching as much for the commercials as for the actual game.&nbsp; Dinner?&nbsp; <em>check.</em>&nbsp; Snacks?&nbsp; <em>check.</em>&nbsp; Done and in front of the television by game time?&nbsp; <em>check</em>.&nbsp; The event over the years has almost become as much about watching the creativity of Madison Avenue ad firms as about running backs and linebackers and we were anticipating the latest from Doritos, Budweiser and GoDaddy.&nbsp; But by the end of the first half, I was taken aback by the commercials because the tone of the ads wasn't remotely close to the care-free beer, babes and goofiness of ads from previous years.&nbsp; What gives?</p>
<p>It was a discordance from previous years that was noticed by others in the household, although I don't know that they'd take a shot at figuring out why.&nbsp; For the record, I believe that television commercials - and shows - are a great indicator of the national consciousness although I do wonder whether there's a <em>chicken/egg</em> question here; do the shows and commercials initially set the tone and direct the consciousness or are they merely channeling what is permeating the nation's consciousness?&nbsp; I'm certain that some shows do try to direct but I don't know whether they're the small minority and the rest just channel and they're jumping on the bandwagon.&nbsp; The science fiction movies of the 1950s certainly played out our national fear about the effects of radiation and nuclear testing (<em>Them</em>, for example).&nbsp; The movies of the early 1970s to the 1980s usually showed a distaste and opposition to the military as the country worked through the after-effects of the draining Vietnamese War.&nbsp; Many television shows of the 1980s and onwards worked through dual issues of divorce and feminism by often - as in most of the time - portraying fathers as buffoons and well-intentioned idiots.&nbsp;  A bit broad perhaps, but the evidence is there.</p>
<p>But the commercials' tone was vastly different last night.&nbsp; I actually made notes as to topics and there were three separate commercials that played upon the important role that fathers play in the lives of their children.&nbsp; More men do the laundry and cook than before, but the role is more amorphous than the typical mother's role.&nbsp; The most notable was the car commercial in which a boy - a la the Oscar-nominated <em>Boyhood</em> - is shown at points in his life without his father, who is apparently a well-known race car driver.&nbsp; Mom is ever-present but it's obvious that by the time that he's a teen, he's withdrawn from her and the relationship is problematic.&nbsp; But Dad re-enters the picture at the end as he picks up the teen and somehow, magically, the two reconnect in a front-seat hug.&nbsp; Would that it were that easy, but the point is obvious that when your attention is not upon the family but upon yourself, there's a steep price to be paid.&nbsp; These aren't about mothers who are presumed to be present and engaged, but about fathers - <em>us</em> - with the message that we matter.&nbsp; Even the Budweiser lost dog commercial is clearly carrying a message that it's necessary to look after the little ones, who are likely to suffer if we aren't present and in the game.&nbsp; The most glaring example was the suicide-inducing Nationwide commercial about a kid who will never enjoy a prom or other activities because he died in a childhood accident.&nbsp; It was a message so out of keeping with past Super Bowl ads that both and my eldest son and I immediately and vociferously remarked on it.&nbsp; <em>Whoa!&nbsp; Did you see that?!&nbsp; Holy shit!&nbsp; Way to kill the buzz, Nationwide!</em></p>
<p>The other message of note pertained to overcoming obstacles.&nbsp; There were two, from different corporations, that each featured real-life people overcoming the loss of legs and obviously on the national consciousness for all of the veterans who have lost limbs in the past fourteen years.&nbsp; These people weren't veterans - one was a female athlete and the other a small boy - but each was capable of overcoming such an obvious loss and taking on an active and vibrant life.&nbsp; Another ad dealt with helping teenage girls overcome the self-image issues that plague them with the onset of puberty.&nbsp; Each child or person was asked to run like a girl, throw a ball or punch like a girl and the result was predictably sexist.&nbsp; These shots are then compared with the results when young girls are themselves asked and the results are not sexist in the least as the girls run, punch and throw an imaginary ball without any hint of obvious effeminacy.&nbsp; The point of these ads is that what matters is what you think and not others so go ahead and don't be discouraged.</p>
<p>The most notable difference however was in the GoDaddy commercial.&nbsp; Previous years all played out around beautiful, sexy women and displayed a glitz and raciness that left people talking afterwards for days.&nbsp; But the sole GoDaddy ad quietly showed a man working patiently at his desk with the surrounding windows portraying nighttime.&nbsp; No wild music, no women and just the narrator stating that for all of the hard work that you, the small business owner, is putting in to get ahead, we'll lift a dip-filled chip in salute to you.&nbsp; The advertisers are obviously aware that in the present state of zombified-economy America, there are more businesses <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/more-businesses-are-closing-than-starting-can-congress-help-turn-that-around/2014/09/17/06576cb8-385a-11e4-8601-97ba88884ffd_story.html" title="washingtonpost.com">closing than opening</a> and with much of their own business dependent upon domain registration and website management, it's crucial that their clients buckle down and grind it out.</p>
<p>Whether Madison Avenue is the chicken that's just passing along the gist of the national consciousness or it's the egg that's cluing in a mass audience that all really isn't well, the message is there and clear.&nbsp; <em>Buckle down and get ready for the grind.&nbsp; It's going to be difficult with many obstacles, but it's certainly not unconquerable.&nbsp; And above all, look to your family - especially you men - and understand that despite what's been televised for the past quarter-century or so, you have an important role in raising your children and preparing them for the world.</em>&nbsp; The gravity found in these commercials on what is typically such a light-hearted broadcast indicates that the consciousness is aware that exceedingly difficult times are ahead and is now formulating it for the mass consumption to the widest audience possible.&nbsp; Get ready and gather the kids in.&nbsp; Something wicked this way comes.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>The Dollar&#8217;s Flaw as the Global Reserve Currency</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>Middle is now immersed in AP Economics, learning about variable and marginal cost curves and utility, yet still without any notion of something as basic as the definition of money.&nbsp; This is a follow-up to a previous article that I wrote for him - <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/741" title="PracticalDad:  So, Just What is Money?">So, Just What is Money?</a> - because I find it problematic to learn about details without a general understanding of larger, more basic topics within the subject.&nbsp; So, Middle, once again grab a soda and your earbuds and make yourself comfortable for another lesson.</em></p>
<p>There's a solid argument to be made, amidst the ongoing currency wars, that the American Dollar could soon lose it's status as the Global Reserve Currency despite its present <em>big kid on the block</em> status when compared with the rest of the world's currencies.&nbsp; I frankly believe that it will happen and sooner than later.&nbsp; Yet while there are many rationales and explanations for why this might occur, I think that the true reason rests at the economically molecular level of the definition of money.&nbsp; Yes, many in the world want to see the dollar fall as a poke-in-the-eye to the arrogant Americans and God knows there are others who cannot reconcile a Global Reserve Currency with a huge debtload.&nbsp; But the core reason is that we no longer manage our currency, the dollar, with the same emphasis as the remainder of the world must manage their own currencies and the world will somehow - messily - create a system that better aligns its needs.</p>
<p>Understand that <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/741" title="PracticalDad:  So, Just What is Money?">there are three operative characteristics for anything that is agreed upon to serve as money</a>.&nbsp; First, it must be <em>fungible</em> such that any one unit of currency can be used in place of any other unit of that currency; in other words, a crisp new Benjamin from the bank can be as readily accepted as a Benjamin that you pull from your wallet.&nbsp; Second, money is a <em>medium of exchange</em> which serves to simply make the daily transaction of business all that much easier.&nbsp; My wallet is far less bulky with three Benjamins than it might be with the assortment of chickens and rabbits that might be required to purchase a like amount of goods were the Benjamins not available.&nbsp; Finally, money should be reliably relied upon to serve as a <em>store of value</em>; it should be expected to purchase the same amount of goods and services in the future as it does today.&nbsp; With a few exceptions in the world, most nations have a currency that serves as money because each sufficiently meets the three criteria that the population accepts it.&nbsp; When there is a sufficiently large breakdown in a currency, such as in Zimbabwe, then the population creates and sustains a black market in some other material that serves in lieu of the local currency.</p>
<p>And it's here, within these three characteristics, that the flaw lies.&nbsp; Since the end of the Second World War, the American economy has been predicated upon consumption as an economic driver and all efforts have gone to build and sustain that consumption.&nbsp; The supposition is that as people spend their money on goods and services, that money flows throughout the economy and provides demand for other goods and services in a sort of virtuous economic circle.&nbsp; It was during the Great Depression of the 1930s that the American government adopted Keynesian theory in the hopes of providing demand by running governmental deficits, using public debt as fuel for a stricken economy until it could recover enough to not require the debt-fuel.&nbsp; That thinking has generally continued since then with debt run-ups shifting back and forth from private to public sector through the decades until there's presently a huge overhang of total debt.&nbsp; The use of debt to fuel consumption also serves to pump money into the money supply, which is essentially an <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/669" title="PracticalDad:  What is Inflation Anyway?">inflationary practice</a> that not only has a domestic effect but an international effect as well since the dollar is the global reserve currency.&nbsp; The upshot is that if business is transacted in dollars and the cost of a good rises as the supply of dollars rises, then any nation wishing to engage in business will see prices rise in its own currency since it would take more to purchase the dollars to satisfy the transaction.&nbsp; The offsetting result to this practice is that while consumption continues and debt builds, such practices are inherently inflationary and slowly, willingly sacrifice the <em>store of value</em> characteristic.</p>
<p>This is apparently fine for our own country but it does create problems for the rest of the world.&nbsp; The American economy since the Second World War has been something that's outstripped any previous economy in the history of the world.&nbsp; Our citizens have prospered and reached a standard of living that no other society had ever before achieved.&nbsp; Having a currency with the Global Reserve Status allows a privilege and latitude that people with other currencies don't enjoy if simply by dint that those with the GRC status can literally print as much as they choose while the Norwegians, South Africans, Jordanians and Chinese cannot.&nbsp; These other countries must still contend with the quaint notion that money should serve as a store of value so that their people can continue the finer things in life, such as bread and adequate shelter.&nbsp; They do not have the amount of wealth as the average American - or at least the .1% - and their economic security in the global economy is a bit more tenuous and dependent upon the policy decisions of foreigners than we are as Americans.&nbsp; At least for now.</p>
<p>Writers such as Yves Smith of <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com" title="nakedcapitalism.com">naked capitalism</a> have explained how economists went to great lengths to quantify economics and make it into a hard-style science such as physics or chemistry.&nbsp; Yet why a nation's currency is granted the GRC status is essentially unquantifiable, based upon non-economic factors.&nbsp; It's that nation which is not only militarily strong, but also perceived to be solid and relatively prudent, at least until the leadership drinks the kool-aid and sends that nation down the path to Wonderland.&nbsp; The key word is perception and that is simply unquantifiable.&nbsp; But any money must meet the three criteria for common acceptance and there has to be a general agreement amongst all users - domestic and foreign - that there is a semblance of parity between the three.&nbsp; There can be temporary discrepancies but if the semblance of balance isn't maintained, then pressures grow within the system until such time that the perception breaks and something new comes about to take its place.&nbsp; In the case of the Dollar, the notion that a store of value could be maintained existed so long as the Dollar was essentially backed by gold, that material that everyone across the globe considers as the principal store of value <em>par excellence</em>.&nbsp; But when Richard Nixon took the United States off of the gold standard in 1971, it was then that the notion of perception truly took center stage.&nbsp; It is because we have chosen to so over-emphasize the medium of exchange characteristic, sacrificing the store of value as our leadership purposefully strives for inflation to simultaneously stoke consumption and inflate away our debt, that the rest of the world has altered their perception of our collective wisdom to manage the dollar in a way that is truly mindful of its status as the Global Reserve Currency.&nbsp; There is no way to quantify how this perception has suffered or measure when such a massive change will occur.&nbsp; But the rise of the BRICS and the increasing use of the Remimbi to settle international transactions makes clear that the Dollar's days are numbered.&nbsp; The problem for the average person is that reading about it is, by nature, sterile and unexciting; real life however, is generally far more exciting and colorful as it plays out in the store aisles and down the street.&nbsp; We have raised our children in a society that demands consumption.&nbsp; We will have to collectively figure out how to raise them in a new society that is far more mindful of value than it has been in generations.</p>

 <title>A WTF Proposal on Reducing 529 Tax Benefits</title>
 <content:encoded><p>It was an audible <em>what the f*#%</em> that escaped my lips as I read a NY Times article that explained how <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/your-money/obamas-proposed-changes-to-529-college-savings-plans-would-reduce-benefits.html?_r=0" title="nytimes.com">President Obama was now proposing to eliminate tax-free withdrawals from 529 college savings plans.</a>&nbsp; Under the proposed changes, the money earned from any new contributions to 529 accounts would lose the capital gains tax protections that have made 529 plans a decent tool in the belt for paying for higher education.&nbsp; In addition to the loss of the capital gains tax forgiveness - if the money is used for qualified educational expenses - the money earned via the accounts investments would actually be taxed at the much higher ordinary income rate.&nbsp; Incredibly enough, the proposal is part of a much broader package that a White House official described as designed to consolidate a variety of educational tax breaks and also funnel more money to middle-class families.</p>
<p>Let's take a few minutes to actually parse through the proposed changes since this strikes me as a measure with multiple intents.&nbsp; First, I have no doubt that this is tied to the floated proposal to <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/738" title="PracticalDad:  Some Thoughts on Free Community College">fund free community college for eligible students.</a>.&nbsp; While the tuition proposal is the carrot however, this measure would be the stick to help herd even more young people into the community college track.&nbsp; We already know that the disparity between the stagnant income and the wildly inflative tuition rates has led to a shifting of family income levels downwards through the college system.&nbsp; What I mean by this is that as tuition rates have risen far faster than family incomes, what a family could afford for their children has shifted downwards from private non-profit institutions (Yale or Pacific Lutheran for example) to state supported institutions (any of the SUNY institutions or your local state college).&nbsp; So while a solidly middle class family could get the kids through a Pacific Lutheran in 1980, the same family would be hard-pressed to do so in 2015 and would be more likely to have the kid attending the local state college or university instead.&nbsp; Even if the states are, as a group, funding less on a per student basis than in the past decades, state schools are still more affordable and the 529 plans are a legitimate tool in saving for that alternative.&nbsp; Remove the 529 plans as an effective savings instrument and even the public institutions become more unaffordable; the result is that if the youngsters are going to be educated, then one of the few alternatives is to utilize the community college for an associate degree or if a bachelor's degree is sought, the first two years of general education requirements.</p>
<p>Second, make no mistake that there's an almost punitive intent in this proposal.&nbsp; It would be one thing to make the 529 less attractive by simply removing the preferred tax status of capital gains forgiveness and there are more than a few people who would probably look at the 529 and say <em>meh</em>, moving on to other alternatives.&nbsp; But this proposal moves far beyond that:  this actually turns standard taxation and accounting measures on their heads by taking what monies have been made from a capital gain status - which is precisely what they are - and wholesale shifting them to an income status with a concomitant increase in taxes.&nbsp; The authors of this proposal are doing the old west equivalent of dumping dead animals in the water hole to poison it for anyone else.</p>
<p>Third, there is signifcant debate over what income level is, in the eyes of the authors, the middle class.&nbsp; The class card is played by the notion that the 529 plans "primarily provide a subsidy to people who would save in other forms anyway", according to Sandy Baum of the Urban Institute.&nbsp; Yes, it does provide extra bang for the proverbial buck over other investment vehicles.&nbsp; But that tax provision was an intentional public policy message that higher education did matter and this program was an effort to help offset what even then was recognized as an oncoming problem.&nbsp; The notion that the 529 is simply another investment vehicle, akin to the standard mutual fund or whatever, is also not true since anybody who's investing in the 529 plan understands that use of the funds for any other purposes means that there's going to be a tax penalty for withdrawal.&nbsp; If this is just another savings vehicle, then just take the money and dump into a consistent money-losing fund that costs you 10% annually.&nbsp; The class argument is also offset by the fact that the average 529 account only has about $19770 and the average regular monthly contribution is $175.&nbsp; This isn't the kind of investor that's looking to get subsidized; this is the kind of investor that's hoping to squirrel away enough money to get the kids through a state institution.&nbsp; The GAO notes that while only a small percentage of families utilize 529 accounts, the median income of those families with 529 accounts is three times that of those without 529 accounts.&nbsp; I believe that would actually be true, apart from the fact that it's coming from the GAO.&nbsp; The simple fact however, is that it's common knowledge that higher incomes simply remove the possibility of any grant or need-based scholarship for the student, leaving the costs to be either borne by the family and/or student with savings and debt.</p>
<p>The Obama Administration notes that it has other incentives to more than adequately offset the 529 change.&nbsp; These include making the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/American-Opportunity-Tax-Credit" title="irs.gov">American Opportunity Tax Credit </a> permanent, with a maximum credit of $2500 annually, subject to income requirements.&nbsp; The other notable action put forward by the administration is that the tax bill on any student forgiven (yes, they'll forgive the debt but you have to pay taxes as though it was an income) would be eliminated.&nbsp; The reality there is that unless you are engaged in a program that eliminates student debt in return for service of some kind, it's damned hard to get the student debt forgiven.&nbsp; The onus is upon the borrower and the person has to demonstrably show that it is indeed a hardship for self and family; that is a steep hill to climb and few are able to do so.</p>
<p>The families utilizing the 529 plans are the ones who are looking ahead to the future and making an effort to save for it.&nbsp; Eliminating the benefits of the 529 is as much a penalty for savers as are the other policies of the government, most especially the ridiculous rates on various savings accounts.&nbsp; The message from the power structure is that we aren't to worry, that there will be other options and if nothing else, we can always just borrow more when the time comes...precisely the last thing that savers and responsible parents want to hear.</p>
<p>There is also another aspect to this entire matter that bothers me, but it's something that I frankly have to work through before I put it out there.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, there will something more on this when I'm comfortable that I've thought it through.</p>

 <title>So, Just What is Money?</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>It's been clear that we're involved globally in currency wars and the recent decision by the Swiss National Bank to cut its peg to the Euro is one more skirmish.&nbsp; Yet at the same time on the family front, Middle is beginning a semester course in AP Economics so there are basic questions about economics to be discussed.&nbsp; I've already written about <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/463" title="PracticalDad Primer on Interest Rates">what interest rates are</a> as well as <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/669" title="PracticalDad:  Just What is Inflation Anyway?">the definition of inflation</a> with the notion that the kids will read them at some point.&nbsp; But what's happening globally begs a very, very basic question:  just what is money?&nbsp; I'll be forwarding this to Middle for his light evening reading because I believe that the heart of the current global currency wars and economic dislocations centers on a basic disagreement of the operational function of money, particularly between the United States - holder of the global reserve currency - and the Chinese.&nbsp; So, Middle, grab a soda and earbuds and settle down for a little while...</em></p>
<p>We're inundated with all manner of informational overload about Personal Finance.&nbsp; We worry about what the kids are learning and how they'll cope in their future.&nbsp; But for all of the ink, there's a simple question that's overlooked:  what exactly is money?&nbsp; What is it about that crumpled five dollar bill that I just pulled out of your jeans before they went into the wash (and it's now waiting for you on the dresser) or that 1 Euro coin that came back from last summer's <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/714" title="Traveling With The Kids:  IG2BTK Tour 2014">long-awaited trip</a>?&nbsp; They are obviously different in all ways - shape and substance, language, etc. - but each serves an identical purpose for its respective nation(s).&nbsp; It doesn't make much sense to go into marginal analysis and supply/demand curves or ascertaining the cost of interest if you don't at least have a handle on that most basic financial tool, money.&nbsp; For all of the differences in currencies across the globe - dollar, euro, krona, yuan, yen - each has three operative characteristics in common that make them able to serve as money.&nbsp; It's important to understand these three characteristics because I believe that the heart of the most basic issues involving the currency wars is because the rest of the world places a greater emphasis upon one characteristic than the US does and the difference has created fundamental problems for the world that can no longer be ignored.</p>
<p>The first characteristic of money is that it is <em>fungible</em>.&nbsp; One unit of money within a particular issuing region is precisely interchangeable with any other unit of that money.&nbsp; In other words, that crumpled five dollar bill on your dresser could be taken to the soda cave at the nearby convenience store and used to purchase a bottle of Stewart's Orange Cream Soda as well as the five dollar bill that I pulled from my wallet to give you for that same bottle of soda, assuming of course that I was willing to do that.&nbsp; You could borrow a five dollar bill from your buddy for the soda and that would serve as well as the crisp new fiver that you got from the bank.&nbsp; The point is that they are interchangeable for use - fungible - and the store clerk is legally required to take any fiver presented to pay for the soda.&nbsp; The sole reasons for not taking the note would be that it was either somehow damaged beyond repair - sorry, but half of a note is unusable - or there's reason to believe that it's counterfeit.&nbsp; This same premise holds true across the globe in any reasonably functioning nation in which the citizenry actually has a semblance of trust in its currency; any ten pound note could be used to purchase chips in an English pub and any renmimbi note could be used to purchase cigarettes in a Chinese market.&nbsp; If the people of a particular country want to take some other currency instead of their own for daily life - think Zimbabwe or Argentina for instance - then they have much deeper issues both economically <em>and</em> politically since the two go together like crap and stink.</p>
<p>The second characteristic of money is that it serves as a <em>medium of exchange</em> for any transactions that occur in an economy.&nbsp; It that sense, money is a kind of tool that makes life easier.&nbsp; The classic example would be in a simple farm and trade economy in which everybody has to barter what they have - chicken eggs for instance - for something else that they need.&nbsp; If Farmer A has eggs but needs a plow fixed and the blacksmith doesn't need eggs but would rather have sheep wool, then Farmer A has to figure out exactly who both needs his eggs <em>and</em> has sheep wool; if no one else readily comes to mind, then the potential range of transactions becomes larger:&nbsp;  A trades his eggs to C for five bushels of excess grain and A in turn gives four of those bushels to F for the wool; A can then give the wool to the blacksmith for the plow repair and keep the grain as profit.&nbsp; Over the course of centuries of this barter economy, people began to use various forms of money to make their lives easier and eliminate the need to navigate a massive web in order to get the plow repaired.&nbsp; The biggest hurdle to overcoming barter and moving to money was the rise of a common belief that that form of currency would be good so that all parties could buy into that system and participate.&nbsp; This was frequently based upon the belief that the political power was stable to enforce the laws and back that currency.&nbsp; If you want a more up-to-date example of currency and the forms that it could take, think back to the night that we watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046359/" title="imdb.com">Stalag 17</a> on <em>Turner Classic Movies</em>.&nbsp; William Holden played Sergeant JJ Sefton, a cynical anti-hero who was the resident scrounger and procurer of all good things within the German prison camp.&nbsp; There's a scene in the first half in which he has his minion - because we all need our minions - inventory the contents of his usually locked footlocker.&nbsp; He is loaded with cigarettes but also has a lesser quantity of chocolate bars, silk hosiery, men's cologne and even a camera.&nbsp; In the closed society of the Stalag, the American dollar is worthless for everyday transactions because it is simply not accepted as a medium of exchange and God knows that the Germans wouldn't be giving the prisoners Deutschemarks.&nbsp; But the cigarette is the commonly accepted medium of exchange for transactions between the prisoners and even the guards since the Germans produced lousy cigarettes and even they acknowledged that.&nbsp; The cigarette is ideal because in that time and place, everybody smokes and accepts them; there is also a constant, but rationed supply coming into the Stalag via the Red Cross parcels that the prisoners periodically receive.&nbsp; So if you want to bribe a guard or transact some business with another prisoner, the cigarette is the ideal form of money and the lesser quantity items would serve as the higher denominated forms of money.&nbsp; A Red Cross parcel might contain two packs of 20 cigarettes each but only two chocolate bars, so in the purely theoretical world of currency exchange, a chocolate bar would be worth a pack of cigarettes and if it wasn't, then that would be due to purely local conditions.&nbsp; The point is that everybody accepted them because all believed that American cigarettes were superior and that they were typically available.</p>
<p>Which leads to the third operative characteristic of money, a <em>store of value</em>.&nbsp; People will use something as a form of money if it can reliably be found to hold it's value, particularly measured by an ability to purchase the same amount of something over time.&nbsp; If that form can't maintain it's value, then the people will engage in economic behaviors to account for that until another form of money is found to replace it.&nbsp; What might those behaviors be?&nbsp; One might be to simply spend it as soon as possible instead of even bothering to save - the grasshopper side of Aesop's <em>Ant and the Grasshopper</em> - because there's no point to keeping it.&nbsp; The person might also find something else to purchase that she believes will hold value better than the current form of money and in this regard, so-called <em>hard assets</em> such as gold, silver or even diamonds are prime examples.&nbsp; No, you can't buy a Stewart's Orange Cream Soda with a gram of silver but you'll purchase the silver and simply set it aside and hold it as a form of savings since it can hold value.&nbsp; When there's a reason to purchase the Stewart's, then you simply sell the silver and use the actual money as the medium of exchange with the clerk.&nbsp; For the record, I can see absolutely no reason to sell silver in order to purchase Stewart's and if there is, you have more important items to purchase for survival than Stewart's.&nbsp; Think back to the example we used from the movie <em>Stalag 17</em>.&nbsp; The cigarettes are also a valid form of money because they do hold their value well.&nbsp; There is a general equilibrium of value between the supply of cigarettes (periodic supply via the Red Cross parcels) and the demand for cigarettes since they are all smoked.&nbsp; The conditions are set as well for their use since there's really nothing else of commonly-accepted value amongst the general population that could change.&nbsp; On the one hand, the war might end as victorious Allied armies overrun the camps which means that the prisoners are released to the larger society in which they use dollars, and cigarettes become much more plentiful and hence less valuable.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Allied Air Forces under the command of General Bernanke might decide to provide a mass cigarette drop on all known German Stalags as a morale boosting effort.&nbsp; That would certainly make the prisoners happy, but it would utterly ruin Sefton's meticulously constructed business.</p>
<p>So what's the takeaway from this lesson?&nbsp; That whatever serves as a viable form of money in an society must meet three basic criteria and that there should be a general balance between the three.&nbsp; There can certainly be stresses to a currency dependent upon any number of factors whether they are social, economic or political, internal or external.&nbsp; But to appreciate what's going on around you, you have to get your nose off of the screen and begin to pay attention, especially over the course of time; you have to start thinking beyond the now and try to view something as dynamic and within the context of a much longer timespan.&nbsp; And finally, look for any number of ways to place what you're seeing within the context of the greater world.&nbsp; You don't live in a vacuum and what occurs nationally or globally can have a significant local presence right in front of you.</p>

 <title>Another Look at the American Middle Class</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There's been a persistent drumbeat of commentary over the past eight years - since the onset of the Financial Crisis of 2007 - that pertains to the demise of the American Middle Class.&nbsp; It's the start of a period that I refer to myself as <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/666" title="PracticalDad:  The Great Reversion">The Great Reversion</a>.&nbsp; It's framed within the context of a declining median family income as well as declining number of assets, backdropped against what is now the largest gap in wealth distribution since the Roaring Twenties, prior to the Great Depression.&nbsp; But to consider the American Middle Class in such a light is too shallow, both in terms of what it is happening as well as how it came about.&nbsp; What's happening to the American Middle Class is not just an <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/450" title="economic event">economic event</a>.&nbsp; To say that the American Middle Class will suddenly make a magical comeback with a </content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index -January 2015</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The New Year came and went and immediately afterwards, I did the routine for determining the activity of the PracticalDad Price Index of 47 items.&nbsp; This composite marketbasket of 37 foodstuffs and 10 non-foodstuffs is done at the first of each month at three unrelated grocery stores in the area and has been occurring monthly since it's inception in November 2010 (November 2010 = 100).</p>
<p>After a signficant jump in the 37 item Food-Only Subindex from November 2014's 113.87 to December's 115.13 (November 2010 = 100), the January 2015 Food-Only Subindex dropped back to 114.00.&nbsp; The Full Basket Index of 47 items (see <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index - November 2010">here</a>) actually rose slightly from December's 111.18 to January's 111.32 based upon price increases in non-food items such as soap, diapers and paper towels.</p>
<p>The December increase was led by a rise in the cost of a dozen large eggs, reflecting foreign demand for American supply due to Avian Influenza and I surmised then that the price would decrease again, and this occurred as the average price of a dozen eggs dropped by 19%; this was still higher than the November price before the December spike.&nbsp; Dairy products also showed an improvement as Milk (1 gallon 2%) and butter (1 lb quarters) each dropped by 8.8% and 10.7% respectively.&nbsp; Looking at the 37 foodstuffs in all, there were eight items with a price increase versus seven items that decreased in price, although the average price decrease was 6.58% versus an average price rise of 2.17%.</p>
<p>The price increases in soap and diapers were extremely small but the index was affected most by a price increase at one store - and yes, there's the downfall to a small sampling size - of paper towels by 52%.&nbsp; Because this store was part of a chain, I checked at another of the same chain's stores in the area and the price for that item was consistent elsewhere so this change was not an individual store's error.&nbsp; This massive increase was not seen by the other two stores as one of those stores actually had a small decrease in the cost of their paper towels (eight rolls double ply package).&nbsp; What I do know is that across the past several years, this particular store with the major price increase has become a sort of canary in the coal mine for me with price changes occurring here first and then reflected elsewhere at a later time.&nbsp; So we'll just have to see as the next several months go on as to whether this change is meaningful or just some isolated anomaly.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Some Thoughts on Free Community College</title>
 <content:encoded><p>I was sitting with my Better Half when there was an online article about President Obama's <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/01/08/obama-free-community-college/21466969/" title="usatoday.com">recently announced plan for free community college tuition.</a>&nbsp; As we read the article and then followed up with other sites, the commentary flowed.&nbsp; On the one hand, it can be trolled as yet another spending program with dubious results but there are some other aspects to consider.</p>
<p>Our conversation was framed by a discussion earlier at dinner with one of Middle's friends, who is presently a college junior at a state university.&nbsp; As he explained his course load, he commented that the very first Gen Ed class that he took on Day One was a math course, which started with the concept of <em>counting</em>.&nbsp; Both of us looked at him and my wife stopped and asked for clarification and he confirmed that it started with simple counting before moving on to more complex topics such as addition.&nbsp; This was on top of stories from others of his contemporaries, which led us to the conclusion that much of the early college course load is simply remedial and if this is indeed the case, then there is actually some value in the President's proposal.</p>
<p>But before that, what is the core of the proposal?&nbsp;When you read the brief articles - and yes, the devil is in the details - there are requirements of all parties involved for this to work.&nbsp; First, the students - those who are eligible and I smell income requirements in the air - are required to maintain a GPA of 2.5 and must be in school for at least half-time.&nbsp; They must also show continuing progress towards their program goal, whatever that may be.&nbsp; For their own part, the community colleges will have to offer programs that are either fully transferrable to a <em>local</em> four-year public university or occupational training programs for which there is high demand (and oh yeah, actual job opportunities).&nbsp; The government part of the deal is that the Federal Government will put up three-quarters of the money and the states will put up the other quarter of the funding; in the ideal theoretical world, the student would be able to save $3800 in tuition each year.</p>
<p>Now let's pick this apart as we did on the sofa.&nbsp; The reality facing America is that our students, as a whole, are performing poorly versus their peers across the globe.&nbsp; Our students are behind in science and math, critical in today's technological society.&nbsp; But look at the cost differential of the same type of course taught at both the community college and local state university.&nbsp; A basic three credit Math 100 course at my local community college (and I've verified the numbers via the respective tuition website pages) would cost a student $458 while a basic three credit Math 100 course at the local state university would cost $792, a differential of $334.&nbsp; Since these basic courses would be generally identical in scope, it makes no sense on a societal level to duplicate the courses with some students paying the higher amount and effectively wasting the resources.&nbsp; This is clearly an effort to bring about some relief to the issue of student debt, which now is in excess of <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/10/pf/college/student-loans/" title="$1.2 Trillion">$1.2 Trillion</a>, more than the amount of outstanding credit card debt.&nbsp; It is also a concrete effort to combat the several decade mantra that the college route is the route to take after high school; it's a mantra that has now sucked in enough people to swell the rolls of student debt holders to more than 40 million  young adults.&nbsp; The inclusion of the word <em>local</em> is also meaningful to students.&nbsp; Part of the message sold over the past several decades is loosely reminiscent of Bluto Blutarsky's infamous line from the movie <em>Animal House</em>:  <em>...the best seven years of my life.</em>&nbsp; The community college proposal is squarely saying that a quality higher education doesn't have to include the now-expected time away from home.&nbsp; I understand that there are plenty of young people who crave that - God knows that I did - but that was a different time with a different set of circumstances.&nbsp; With the job market being what it is in terms of wages, would you rather live away from home now and take on debt or clear your decks now and then proceed with your life?</p>
<p>There are other points to make here.&nbsp; It's a message to community colleges that they need to take greater care in offering programs that are indeed timely and of value.&nbsp; As costs drive more away from any higher education, the message is that the money will be there for students if there are programs that make sense; so cull away the nonsense and put together curricula that meets society's demands.&nbsp; It also sends a message that there has to be a greater effort by both the community colleges and four year institutions to mesh what's offered so that money isn't wasted on credits that won't transfer to the four year university.&nbsp; There have been several instances in which I've been told by someone that their kid or neighbor's kid won't have credits transferred, meaning that the resources are wasted.&nbsp; Multiply this across - at least - several hundred thousand students and that's considerable money simply down the tubes.&nbsp; There's likewise a message to the four year institutions that perhaps there are other options to the public and that in a period of declining resources, they're best served putting the money into that which truly does train, educate and enlighten.</p>
<p>Since I began this article two days ago, other information about the proposed cost has been issued by the administration, assuming that you actually believe them.&nbsp; According to the Press Secretary, the President's program would cost about $60 Billion over the course of a decade...so call it roughly $6 Billion annually.&nbsp; The knives will come out and it's going to be decried as budget-busting, although the concept that an outlay of $6 Billion - nah, since we're all of going on $20 Trillion in debt, let's use the lower case and call it <em>billions</em> - is actually laughable in the greater scheme of things.&nbsp; There's actually the argument that this type of spending would actually be an investment.&nbsp; According to the Federal Education Budget Project, produced by the New America Foundation, the collective student default rate for federal student loans as of 2011 <a href="http://febp.newamerica.net/background-analysis/federal-student-loan-default-rates" title="febp.com">was approximately 18%.</a>&nbsp; Yes, this is 2011 data but let's apply this default rate to the 2014 student loans issued in the amount of almost $100 billion; this is a default of approximately $18 billion.&nbsp; The same article from FEBP shows that the net recovery of defaulted money is approximately 80% for a net loss of $3.6 billion.&nbsp; The net differential on the $6 billion average annual outlay is a loss of $2.4 billion.&nbsp; The important thing is that as the system begins to change over time, the defaults should lessen and the money begin to flow to where it's most effective.&nbsp; This doesn't even address the psychic and emotional toll on young adults who are stuck with a debt albatross around their neck as they start out in their adult life, nor does it address the delayed creation of households, which is actually important for the national economic health.</p>
<p>There's one other point from both our conversation and a review of the information.&nbsp; There's a collective failure when the colleges - community and four-year - are forced to offer such utterly ridiculous course offerings as taken by Middle's friend.&nbsp; This information is certainly offered by at the secondary - hell, even the primary - level and it's a complete failure that the information isn't being collectively learned.&nbsp; And that's on us.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Embracing the Suck</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The term <em>embracing the suck</em> was popularized some years ago as a military term, the modern equivalent to the WW2 GI terms <em>FUBAR</em> or <em>SNAFU</em>.&nbsp; The gist of the expression is that there are times when regardless of what you try to do, you're going to be stuck with something so you might as well make the best of it.&nbsp; It's a term that's come into use in the PracticalDad household and particularly in regard to Youngest, who is now in middle school - <em>Dear God, when did that happen?</em> - and finding it as I did during that time, a purgatory to be endured until able to move on to someplace better.&nbsp; The issue surrounds interpersonal stuff with kids, especially the use of nicknames.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's an issue that I know all too well, having spent years - from late elementary school through high school - with the moniker "Weird" attached to my last name.&nbsp; It came quickly enough in elementary school when Bill Cosby premiered his <em>Fat Albert</em> show on Saturday mornings and the kids in my class latched onto it since the character's first name is literally the same as my last name.&nbsp; But the name stuck for more than a short period and suddenly, I found it downright painful at times.&nbsp; I don't know that I was any more weird than any other boy of that age, at the cusp of puberty and entering a phase that truly can be odd on any number of levels.&nbsp; Regardless of my own opinion, the name stuck.</p>
<p>In Youngest's case, his is a nickname that comes not out of behavior or appearance but instead, circumstance.&nbsp; Youngest is an active kid who is in some ways a throwback with his neighborhood buddies, a group of boys who  have routinely gathered at different yards after school to play sandlot football and generally beat the crap out of one another.&nbsp; But through the unorganized activities and the various sports, he's incurred a string of significant injuries over a span of time that have, in each instance, wiped out months of any strenuous physical activity.&nbsp; The most recent injury has had a permanent effect since he's now forbidden to play organized football in school, a sport for which he'd campaigned for several years and one which his mother and I had finally relented, agreeing to give permission to play.&nbsp; With all of the facts now coming out about traumatic brain injuries and the recurrence rate among athletes who have already incurred such an injury, the risk is simply too great.&nbsp; With yet another freak accident this Autumn, his fate and nickname were sealed and even kids at school who don't know his real name, recognize him by the nickname.</p>
<p>Youngest would come home and in discussing the day, he'd express frustration at the ongoing situation.&nbsp; Not only was there too much drama among the collective hormonal melting pot, but now there was this damned nickname.&nbsp; As the conversations continued, he learned that there are really only three options when dealing with the interpersonal crap from others.&nbsp; The first is to simply try ignoring it in the hopes that it either becomes boring for others or someone else is gifted with an even worse moniker to steal the verbal limelight.&nbsp; The second is to make an issue of it with others and deal with it head-on, and typically in an aggressive and occasionally violent way.&nbsp; The third is to simply embrace it, taking it on and trying to make peace with its existence.&nbsp; The first option of trying to ignore it is, for a kid, largely unrealistic.&nbsp; Kids have little patience and sense of time and it would probably take much longer to die away than they're willing to wait.&nbsp; I discussed my own experience with him and freely acknowledge that my own situation eventually went on for years...so look how well that one turned out for me, son.&nbsp; The second, aggressive, option is generally unworkable since there's always - and at any age - some ass who's more than happy to twist the knife and watch the ensuing fireworks.&nbsp; The reality is that by going off, you're surrendering control of the circumstances and wind up dancing to another's tune.&nbsp; The last option is to simply try to find a way to make peace with the situation and even work it to your advantage, i.e. <em>embrace the suck</em>.&nbsp; This option is the one that I adopted in my own youth after some conversation with my own parents.&nbsp; The opinion that I took was that if I was going to be called <em>weird</em>, then I might as well give people something to talk about and hey, maybe even have some fun in the process.&nbsp; So yes, I wound up doing some things that I might not have were it not for the nickname but the truth is also that I had a bit more fun that I would have had otherwise.</p>
<p>Youngest realizes that of all the possible nicknames in the world, his isn't even remotely the worst possible one; this is especially after learning from his grandfather that one of that man's childhood friends was nicknamed <em>booger</em>, a moniker still attached even after six decades.&nbsp; Youngest has also decided to embrace the situation and one of his Christmas gifts was something that he can wear to school that pokes fun at his own situation.&nbsp; It's something that he asked for specifically after seeing it advertised and it now awaits the proper moment for an appearance in school.&nbsp; I have to admire his willingness to go ahead with it and understand it completely since purposefully trotting it out in front of others takes their power away by showing that you can't be affected by their own remarks, comments often made with the intent to belittle and cut.&nbsp; I have no idea when he'll pull out the item and it's possible that it will wait until the weather is not so bitterly cold.&nbsp; But it will come out and Youngest will embrace the suck, a lesson in character that will last him, like others, a lifetime.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - December 2014:&nbsp; Egging on Inflation</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The December 2014 data for the PracticalDad Price Index was collected and tabulated and while the Total Index of the 47 item <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticaldDad Price Index:  November 2010">marketbasket</a> was static from November's 111.15 to 111.18 (November 2010 = 100), the 37 item Food-Only Sub-Index rose to a new high of 115.13 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; This surpasses the previous Sub-Index high of 114.73 reached in September 2014.</p>
<p>Of the 47 items in the marketbasket - 37 foodstuff and 10 non-foodstuff - there were actually more items that decreased in price than increased, 10 decreases to 7 increases with the remainder unchanged.&nbsp; But these were smaller decreases that were offset by a major increase of approximately 37% in the retail price of a dozen large eggs; the average November 1 price of a dozen large eggs was  $1.89 to December's $2.62 per dozen.&nbsp; Why the rise?&nbsp; First, the data from the past four years of the PracticalDad Index demonstrates a Fall/Winter spike in egg prices that subsequently drops back and it's likely that this is another example of those same spikes.&nbsp; Second however, the wholesale price of eggs across the country rose signficantly in the past several months because of increased foreign demand for American eggs.&nbsp; Just as there's been increased foreign demand for American <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/733" title="PracticalDad:  Yes, Meat and Dairy Prices Are Increasing">dairy products</a> because the New Zealand dairy suppliers are also affected by a drought that impacts their own production, Mexico has seen a major decrease in production because of the forced destruction of poultry flocks affected by an outbreak of <a href="http://www.nationalchickencouncil.org/bird-flu-its-not-in-your-food/questions-and-answers-on-avian-influenza/" title="National Chicken Council (yep, it really exists)">Avian Influenza</a>.&nbsp; This poultry virus is highly contagious and the only real measure to combat it is to destroy any flock - healthy birds included - in which it's been detected.&nbsp; It's the possibility that this can mutate and be passed on to humans that keeps epidemiologists awake at night.&nbsp; Any significant  outbreak will accordingly affect supply and Mexico has consequently met its egg demand by importing more from the US.</p>
<p>Will eggs again drop in price in future months?&nbsp; I suspect so, but not to previous levels as before.</p>
<p>There is one other curious observation from the past several months of price surveillance.&nbsp; In two of the three supermarkets - each of which is wholly unrelated to the others - I've been seeing empty sections on the shelves.&nbsp; These spaces aren't just because the product hasn't yet been restocked, but on several occasions there have been small signs stating that the items are discontinued.&nbsp; When I return a different time, that shelf space is filled with another item.&nbsp; I haven't collected any data but am working purely on observation.&nbsp; It does however, make me wonder whether all of the dislocation that we're seeing in this slow motion real-economy train wreck is starting to have an effect on the supply chain and if so, to what extent it will spread.</p>
<p>And now for the past six months of results.</p?

 <title>Cancelling Christmas?&nbsp; Yeah, I&#8217;m Down With That&#8230;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Now that the first third of the major painting project is finished - and that's fodder for another article on practical economics and kids - it's time to get back to writing and what should appear but mild uproar over <a href="http://www.overthebigmoon.com/why-my-husband-and-i-cancelled-christmas/" title="overthebigmoon.com">a parental decision to "cancel" Christmas.</a>&nbsp; Is this going too far?</p>
<p>Let's set the stage here.&nbsp; The parents live in the western US and have three sons ranging from five to eleven years of age.&nbsp; Upset at the ongoing disrespect and ingratitude for a period of months, the two reached a point at which they pulled the plug on Christmas, at least the material Santa-aspect of it.&nbsp; There will still be a tree and the kids will be allowed to receive their gifts from their grandparents and other family members, but the usual Santa-aspect fol-de-rol will be gone this year.&nbsp; In its stead will be activities that foster what should be a greater appreciation for the season - adopting less-fortunate families, adopting elderly neighbors as "grandparents" and inviting them to meals and sending care packages to a weather-devastated village.&nbsp; It isn't simply refusing to even acknowledge the season, but a purposeful refocusing on the meaning of the season to teach a lesson in gratitude and respect for others.</p>
<p>But is it going too far?&nbsp; From my standpoint as a parent of three kids, it's frankly not too far at all and given the ages of the boys, probably not a moment too soon.&nbsp; If you're going to discipline your children, you need to start at a very early age so that you aren't forced to fight battles with recalcitrant and hormonally addled teens, some of whom might actually be bigger than you are.</p>
<p>First, understand that raising kids to be appreciative, respectful and grateful is difficult in present American society.&nbsp; The consumerism runs amok and with the plethora of kid-centric programming - Nick Jr., Nick, Cartoon Network, etc. - there's an ongoing push to have whatever is coming down the pike.&nbsp; This can be coupled with programming that also shows frankly disrespectful behavior to parents and other elders and yes, it is corrosive.&nbsp; At an evening meal this past Thanksgiving break, Eldest and Middle - now in college and high school respectively - rode Youngest for getting Cartoon Network's <em>Fairly Oddparents</em> banned from the household eight years ago when he responded to me with a character's phrase, <em>blah blah blah</em>.&nbsp; Even if the family controls the household electronic media, the kids will likely be spending time in school with more than a few peers in which the programming and media isn't controlled; the upshot is that the kids will still be exposed and influenced via their classmates.&nbsp; We're raising our kids to take their place in the world and the unfortunate reality is that the attitudes and behaviors of other kids will bleed over into our own households and will require ongoing monitoring and conversation.</p>
<p>Second, the mother states in a paragraph that there seems to be a fair number of parents who aren't enforcing discipline upon their kids.&nbsp; There are parents who will threaten consequences that on one hand seem thoroughly unenforceable, such as the several parents that I've overheard at airports threaten their misbehaving children with leaving them behind instead of taking them along to Florida.&nbsp; <em>Really?&nbsp; You're not going to take them along?</em>&nbsp; At some point, the smarter kid realizes that there's no way this is going to happen and the parent loses stature in the kid's eyes and the belief is born that what's coming from the 'rents mouths really is <em>blah blah blah</em>.&nbsp; If discipline is going to be effective, it has to first be enforceable; you can't in the spur of the moment make a threat that can actually be met.&nbsp;<em>Kid, if you don't pull yourself together and stop that behavior now, when we get to Florida, you'll be sitting on the beach towel for the first half hour instead of going in the water.</em>&nbsp; The next part of the deal is to actually enforce the discipline, however unpleasant that might be in the moment.&nbsp; In the case of traveling to Florida, it's actually best if you already have a track record of enforcing the discipline so that the child complies in the public airport instead of melting down into a massive tantrum.&nbsp; So if you promise
in the household to remove a bedroom door for three days should certain misbehavior continue, then you had better follow through when that moment occurs again.&nbsp; When the child realizes that you are actually serious and willing to follow through, then good behavior will generally occur later without the need for public histrionics.</p>
<p>The third point is that our economy is changing before our eyes.&nbsp; In the past several years, the typical family has seen falling income and declining assets, coupled with the need to take on greater responsibility for medical bills and health insurance than before.&nbsp; This is the kiss of death for the consumption model with which we ourselves were raised, when benefits were routinely provided by employers and Grandpa had a pension that provided at least a semblance of some security in his old age.&nbsp; Our own kids need to start seeing a change in the Christmas behaviors and practices so that they can themselves adapt and work within the economic constraints within which they are likely to find themselves.</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm good with the notion of cancelling Christmas if the parents think that that's what is necessary to restore some order in the household.&nbsp;It's not just a simple ban but is being reinforced with more positive behavior that models the better aspects of the season and yes, it is something that the boys will remember, especially when Mom and Dad are telling them something when they're man-children instead of boys.&nbsp; If my own wife and I haven't had to cancel Christmas, it's only because we've already removed bedroom doors and cleaned out bedrooms of all toys for a week at a shot so that the kids understand that we're serious when we say something.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - November 2014:&nbsp; Hot Dog(s)!</title>
 <content:encoded><p>I'll keep this brief since I'm now sandwiched and involved in a home project which promises to morph into something much larger.&nbsp; The November 2014 PracticalDad Price Index was completed and the results show that the Total Index for the 47 item marketbasket rose slightly to 111.15 (November 2010 = 100) from October's 111.11.&nbsp; Despite the fact that beef and dairy prices have been rising significantly in the past several months because of the impact of the drought in the western US, the Food-Only Index for the 37 foodstuff items in the basket actually dropped from October's 114.45 (November 2010 = 100) to November's 113.87, a drop of more than a half point (.58 to be specific).</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the meat and dairy prices will continue to increase, although those prices were static over the course of the month.&nbsp; The drop however, occurred because of a significant price decline in the price of one store's package of hot dogs.&nbsp; It's fascinating to watch since this particular grocer actually engaged in stealth inflation with their hot dog packaging, decreasing the size of the package from 16 to 15 ounces during the summer; their price for hot dogs was substantially higher than their competitors so they decreased the package size to make it more competitive.&nbsp; But within a four month period, they managed to drop the price by 28% and I can only assume that it was because they managed to find a producer capable of offering much lower cost dogs, which is essentially stealth deflation as prices are controlled not by altering the physical package size but rather, the quality of the input foods.&nbsp; So one grocer has managed to engage in both stealth inflation <em>and</em> stealth deflation within a five month period.</p>
<p I do wonder whether there will be a nudge to return to pink slime in order to help extend the supply and keep the price down.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Yes, Dairy and Meat Prices Are Increasing</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The New York Post headline announced that prices were rising for many food staple items, <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/10/26/meat-fruit-milk-and-butter-prices-skyrocket/" title="particularly meat, fruit, milk and butter">particularly meat, fruit, milk and butter</a>.</p>
<p>This was the same message that I got when I recently went shopping with my better half.&nbsp; We had come up the refrigerated dairy aisle and stopped alongside about four other people as everyone gazed at the rows of shredded and block cheese products that were all on sale at prices that, roughly two years ago, were full prices.&nbsp; One person stood with her hand on her chin and commented to her neighbor about the prices and my better half likewise asked, <em>what's going on with cheese?</em>&nbsp; My response was that it was simply due to the mega-drought that's presently parching the western US.</p>
<p>Prices are going up for all of these items and as much as I truly dislike the Federal Reserve, it's actually a supply and demand issue instead of a monetary policy issue.&nbsp; The reality is that the western United States - and especially California - is now locked into a horrendous drought, which some scientists state is the type <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/09/02/california-megadrought/14446195/" title="USA Today">that occurs only about once in a hundred years or so.</a>&nbsp; <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/slideshow/nasa_images_show_severity_of_californias_record-setting_drought/263/1/" title="Yale e360">Satellite images of the San Joaquin valley</a> show the tremendous difference to that valley in the course of only year; what's especially startling in the January year-over-year photos is the loss of the typical snowpack.&nbsp; It's the melting of the snowpack that helps provide water to replenish reservoirs and land and with that diminished, the effect is impressive.&nbsp; It was this kind of megadrought that was thought to be responsible for the gradual destruction of the Anasazi culture that flourished in the pre-European southwestern United States, leaving behind the famous cliff dwellings at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/chcu/index.htm" title="nps.gov">Chaco Canyon</a> in present-day Arizona.&nbsp; This isn't meant to be breathlessly apocalytic, but a drought of this magnitude is going to leave a considerable hurting on how we live in those conditions and in those areas.</p>
<p>The fact is, California and the western US provide a significant percentage of our national food supply.&nbsp; The state's top five agricultural products are <a href="http://westernfarmpress.com/tree-nuts/what-happens-if-us-loses-california-food-production" title="westernfarmpress.com">dairy, greenhouse/nursery products, grapes, walnuts and beef livestock</a> and the effect of the drought has already been dramatic;&nbsp; In late 2013, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/17/cargill-beef-closing-idUSL1N0I72IU20131017" title="reuters.com">agricultural conglomerate Cargill announced that it was closing yet another beef feedlot </a> in Texas as the size of the aggregate US cattle herd dropped to levels unseen since the early 1950s.&nbsp; The principal cause of the herd decline is due to drought-related high feed costs for ranchers, who correspondingly culled their herds to bring their margins back into line.&nbsp; Considering that the population of the US has more than doubled from 131 million to 308 million from 1950 to 2010, it's a given that a significant drop in supply would affect prices.&nbsp; When the USDA reports that <a href="http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter2.pdf" title="usda.gov">the typical American consumes 7 more pounds of beef today than in the 1950s</a>, then clearly the demand is up as well and with that, prices.&nbsp; California provides the same for dairy as it is <a href="http://www.californiadairypressroom.com/Press_Kit/Dairy_Industry_Facts" title="californiadairypresskit.com">the number one state for production of milk and dairy products, accounting for about 20% of domestic US milk production.</a>&nbsp; So it's a given there as well that any impact upon the supply is going to have a corresponding effect upon prices, especially when Americans are likewise prolific milk drinkers.&nbsp; But the other part of the demand issue is that we're now exporting far more dairy production to other countries, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-06-05/china-wants-americas-milk-and-u-dot-s-dot-dairy-exports-benefit" title="bw.com">particularly China</a>, than in the past.&nbsp; New Zealand leads the world in dairy exports but is likewise suffering from drought-related supply issues so that their customers are looking elsewhere and that elsewhere is the US.&nbsp; China's appetite for milk has led to a 39% rise in US dairy exports in the first quarter of 2014 alone and while it's nominally only about $700 million - <em>how jaded are we when a million of anything doesn't seem like much?</em> - that's still a lot of dairy that isn't making it to our own shelves.</p>
<p>So yes, prices are rising and as the drought continues and we use our own food supplies for export purposes, they're going to continue doing so.&nbsp; It's a simple math problem.&nbsp; Understand that inflation is not a single variable issue but a bubbling stew of multiple ingredients - supply and demand, monetary supply and policy, technological change and political policy amongst others.&nbsp; But when you examine the causes, you have the ability to look at larger issues and the mundane price of those blocks of cheese on that refrigerated aisle shelf take on new meaning.&nbsp; A New Yorker commented to the Post reporter that while prices have gone up, her income has not, as it hasn't for hundreds of millions of other Americans.&nbsp; If we're going to permit an unfettered laissez-faire capitalism by producers, then we have to look to the income side of the house and see why our incomes haven't risen accordingly.&nbsp; What's the cause and what can and must be done to bolster that income to sustain a diminishing middle class?&nbsp; Indeed, should we begin adopting policies that protect the food supply for our own citizenry instead of using food as an export entry in the trade balance ledger?&nbsp; Much as I don't want anyone anywhere to starve, China's demand for milk is partially predicated upon their own citizens' distrust of their domestic production due to pollution and safety issues, and that is their problem.&nbsp; Not ours.</p>
<p>Prices for those items will continue to rise until such time as either demand decreases or supply increases.&nbsp; Until then, we'll certainly have to make the necessary micro-level changes such as buying and freezing extra blocks of cheese on sale, shifting to other protein sources to replace beef, and becoming far more purposeful in our meal-planning and shopping.&nbsp; But we'll have to also begin expecting that our leadership - political and business - review and change the policies that benefit the corporations to the detriment of the individual.&nbsp; We can't repeal the laws of supply and demand...they are as real as gravity.&nbsp; But we can and should expect that leadership won't engage in monetary and political policies that create conditions that are only exacerbated when supply and demand go south.</p>

 <title>Conversations with the Kids:&nbsp; Corporate versus Local</title>
 <content:encoded><p>One of the great issues of our day - and one that casts a shadow over our youngsters as they move forward - is that of the power of the corporation versus the power of the individual.&nbsp; We're in a time that's most akin to the Gilded Age of the late 1800s as the uber-wealthy, the corporations and the financial sector hold outsized control of the levers of power in the nation.&nbsp; The situation has become so outlandish that the Supreme Court has ruled that capping the amount of political contributions is a violation of the right of free speech, including that of corporations which are at their heart, wholly fictitious legal entities created solely to earn a profit for a small group of initial investors.&nbsp; Until there is significant enough unrest to force change, and that was at the heart of the labor conflicts of the late 19th century, this is the world into which my children will enter.&nbsp; So what can and should I do as a father and parent to prepare them for entry into that world?</p>
<p>Short of singing union songs about beating up the scabs in lieu of grace at the dinner table, there are two important things, even if they seem insignificantly small in the moment.&nbsp; The first is to understand that the kids are watching you and taking their cues from you in how they deal with the daily issues of life.&nbsp; Many parents wonder whether the kids are even paying attention as immersed as they are in the electronic ether but I believe that they are paying attention to both your actions and inactions.&nbsp; If I'm going to preach the inequities caused by the rise of the corporations at the expense of the individual, then I'm going to have to be far more purposeful in my own spending and that goes to where I shop.&nbsp; The persistent drumbeat of consumerism - <em>buy more, buy cheap</em> - over decades of advertising does create real <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/595" title="practicaldad:  cognitive dissonance and shopping">cognitive dissonance</a> for someone who's shopping.&nbsp; The simple reality is that purchasing an American made consumer product is probably going to cost more simply because the labor costs of an adult labor is greater than that of Chinese peasants or Indonesian children.&nbsp; The upshot is that there's going to be less money around for the stupid crap that so many Americans purchase in the hopes of filling whatever emptiness exists in their lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second thing is to constantly look for situations in which you can have conversation with the kids, the proverbial <em>teaching moments</em>.&nbsp; Such instances do crop up and two did so within the last week.&nbsp; In the first case, Eldest called me from college with the news that her car had a flat tire.&nbsp; No big deal since we purchased a AAA membership for her when she took the car to school and she'd already contacted them to arrange service.&nbsp; She also arranged to have it towed to a tire dealer for a new tire, which was fine thus far.&nbsp; But we parted ways when she then told the tire dealer - a Firestone dealer - to have the mechanic look at other issues under her hood, which she couldn't specify apart from a perceived shimmy and grinding noise.&nbsp; The bill was coming back to me and my immediate response was to tell her to have the dealer contact me directly.&nbsp; When they did so, they had already done some looking under the hood and had a list of things that could be the issue and were of possible concern.&nbsp; Eldest was concerned about the driveability of the car while I was more concerned about a vehicle which, in my opinion, had issued the dealer a fishing license.&nbsp; If the tire hadn't gone flat, the car wouldn't have been there in the first place and with so little specificity, I was greatly concerned that the repairs would be unnecessary and financially excessive.&nbsp; In the end, I authorized only the purchase of two new mid-range tires and asked for a list of what they considered possible causes and then directed Eldest to take the car to a reputable local mechanic, one who had serviced the cars of other family in that area for decades.&nbsp; Eldest had the list of suggested repairs in hand when she went to the local mechanic and after a test drive, he solved her issues with a $50 repair that wasn't even on the dealer's list.&nbsp; The lesson to Eldest was that the corporate dealers had no loyalty to any individual and were usually only concerned with their own bottom line instead of yours.&nbsp; A good local mechanic however, was intimately aware of the power of referral and good service and was generally in the mindset that customers were also neighbors as well.</p>
<p>The second moment occurred with Youngest, an aspiring drummer.&nbsp; His first drum set is a decent beater set from a thrift store, a reputable brand that has simply seen better days despite it's continued usefulness.&nbsp; It was good for the first year of practice in which the user typically beats instead of plays the drums but the boy is  moving beyond that.&nbsp; He asked for a floor Tom to supplement the existing pieces and that request led to a visit to a local Guitar Center, a corporate music store that specializes in rock n' roll stuff such as guitars, drums, keyboards and amps.&nbsp; He understood that this was simply an educational visit on top of a small purchase to help repair a high-hat cymbal and listened as I spoke with the employee in the drum section.&nbsp; The employee was clear that while they might be able to get ahold a floor Tom on special order, the usual route to purchasing drums was to buy an entire set in order to get a significant price break and if we wanted, there were any number of good mid-line sets that he could show us.&nbsp; I let Youngest look but demurred on anything apart from the needed piece and the boy left the store with stars in his eyes for a set that cost in excess of $800.&nbsp; But while on the other side of town, I passed a locally owned drum store that services multiple counties and decided to stop in to learn more about floor Toms and buying by the piece instead of the set.&nbsp; The owner is a younger guy who's decided to be the go-to guy for the region and is far more well stocked for all manner of drums than the corporate Guitar Center.&nbsp; He took me to a room in which there were a significant number of used Toms available, traded in by previous drummers.&nbsp; We spoke for a good quarter hour and the gist of the conversation was that no two drummers were alike and in fact, many preferred to buy by the piece and assemble their own custom set.&nbsp; He challenged the statement that you should only buy by the set and confirmed by belief that there was greater profit - and salesman commission - in selling by the set; it also made it easier for a staff that wouldn't be as familiar with the merchandise as someone who did this full-time.&nbsp; I have since shared this with Youngest, including the fact that there's greater commission for a salesman who can sell an entire set at one time, even if it is pricier than the customer might be able or willing to afford.&nbsp; The upshot for each child has been a lesson in practical economics, that you're liable to get better and more customized service from a local merchant who has skin in the community's game.</p>
<p>As the middle class is winnowed away, there will be increasing social and political friction until there's a breaking point.&nbsp; I don't profess to know what the final result will be, except for the fact that the resources and opportunities available to our adult children will be less than they are today let alone what they were when we were young.&nbsp; My job until that time is to teach the kids and help them find a way to safely navigate this economy with some integrity.&nbsp; If I can also set the stage for a future more vibrant and diversified local economy that's able to withstand the corporations, then that's the added bonus.&nbsp; I will continue to search for the teachable moments as they arise and in this corporate version of America, those moments will repeatedly present themselves.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>China (Kind of) Overtakes the US.&nbsp; But Maybe Not For Long.&nbsp; Or Maybe.</title>
 <content:encoded><p>I believe in serendipity, the notion that things fall into place unexpectedly; the definition is meant with pleasant connotations but I'll take it however I find it.&nbsp; Shortly after I posted the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/729" title="practicaldad.com">October 2014 PracticalDad Price Index results</a>, I came across two separate and seemingly unrelated news articles.</p>
<p>The first article pertained to the announcement that <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/ftdata/2014/10/08/chinas-leap-forward-overtaking-the-us-as-worlds-biggest-economy/" title="ft.blog">China has finally overtaken the US as the world's largest economy</a>.&nbsp; It was surprising on the face of it since other sources were all pegging that event to finally occur in 8 to 10 years.&nbsp; But further reading showed that this was a different metric, called <i>purchasing power parity</i>.&nbsp; What this means is that the GDP for each nation is adjusted by an international body for the purchasing power of its currency.&nbsp;Since the given is that the price of most items in the US are comparatively more expensive than in China - from the average price of housing to a Big Mac - then this pricing power should be factored into the national GDP.&nbsp; While it sounds a bit far-fetched, the notion that nations such as Italy and the UK are now calculating the contribution of such illegal activites as <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/10853756/Italy-to-boost-GDP-figures-with-drugs-and-prostitution.html" title="telegraph.uk">hookers and blow</a> to their national GDP, then it really isn't that much of a stretch at all.&nbsp; This was a new twist that was implemented just within the past several years and is a different result from the traditional GDP metric which, while still showing the US ahead of China. showed a trend that indicated China was on track to overtake the US by the early 2020s.&nbsp; Naturally, there was some conservative talk radio blowback, condemning the Obama Administration and Democratic Congressional policies for permitting this unconscionable event to occur.&nbsp; And this is what sets me to wondering after reflecting on the second article.</p>
<p>The second article is from the NY Post, which alleged in 2013 that the government cooked the books on the unemployment rate prior to the 2012 presidential election.&nbsp; This most recent column <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/10/06/denver-census-staffer-brings-data-falsification-to-light/" title="nypost.com">alleges that a Denver field office whistleblower has come forward with information that the unemployment numbers are again being cooked</a>.&nbsp; What caught my eye in the article was a comment that it also extended to inflation data.&nbsp; In fairness, the original allegation regarding the pre-election unemployment numbers was investigated by the Commerce Department's OIG with the resultant finding that there was no substantiation to the claim; but the new allegation does make me wonder...especially in light of the ongoing findings about the weaponization of the IRS against conservative groups.&nbsp; It's difficult to know who to believe in this world of <em>he said, she said</em> journalism, a newspaper with a definitive political leaning or an agency of an increasingly distrusted government.&nbsp; It might be a purely academic spitting contest save for one fact:  the inflation rates are now key to the purchasing power parity metric and if anything ever shifted from purely interesting to important, it would be this particular issue.&nbsp; Since the median American family income is still multiple times greater than the median Chinese family income, the ability to keep the inflation rate low in comparison to the Chinese rate could conceivably have some impact on the GDP competition.</p>
<p>I have an elderly friend of Irish descent and his repeated mantra has been <em>never let the facts get in the way of a good story</em> and it's certainly possible that we're now in this operative mode.&nbsp; God knows that there are plenty of other issues that have been, and are, gamed.&nbsp; I won't sit here and say the numbers are or aren't gamed since I simply have no way of knowing.&nbsp; But the question is planted and I'll keep plugging each month with the PracticalDad Price Index.&nbsp; In the long-term, the question of potentially gamed inflation data is a short-term sideshow because the real issue is the passing of the torch of economic dominance from one nation to another.&nbsp; And the truth is that for all of its own problems, China is moving along in such a way as to truly overtake us in a decade or less.&nbsp; Regardless of the question about data quality.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - October 2014</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The following brief <a href="http://www.aol.com/article/2014/09/17/how-everyone-in-america-just-got-a-raise/20963667/?icid=maing-grid7|htmlws-main-bb|dl15|sec1_lnk3%26pLid%3D530427" title="aol.com">article</a> was attached in a quick note from my better half, who commented <i>Wonder how this comports with your pricing</i>.&nbsp; The quick piece was a snarky bit from a writer who noted that we should all feel wealthier for the low food inflation as noted by the government's CPI.&nbsp; As I was several days away from doing the pricing, I thought that it would be worthwhile to compare how the PracticalDad Price Index does actually compare with the monthly results of the CPI?&nbsp; More importantly, what might account for any differences?</p>
<p>First things first, however.&nbsp; The Total Index for the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="practicaldad.com">47 item marketbasket</a> rose slightly from September's 111.07 to October's 111.11 (November 2010 = 100.00); the Food-Only Index covering the 37 items within the basket dropped by .28 from September's 114.73 to October's 114.45 (November 2010 = 100.00).&nbsp; While butter and hot dogs continued to demonstrate the effect of inflation by rising 11.4 and 6% respectively, these were offset by significant declines in white bread, sugar and rice (15.3, 8.1 and 6.4% respectively).&nbsp; In the case of a 20 ounce loaf of store brand white bread, each of the three grocery stores has now dropped the standard price to $1 or less, whereas the prices for the loaf had been on the order of $1.25 or more in past months.&nbsp; As usually occurs, these declines occurred in different months so that the price impact is muted over a longer period of time.&nbsp; What this does show however, is that the grocers are responding to the decreasing buying power of the typical consumer by finding ways to offer a lower priced basic good; I expect that this is because there is use of lower quality flour or some other ingredient than before (<a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/701" title="practicaldad.com">stealth deflation</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how does the CPI figure issued by the US Government differ from what I'm capturing with the PracticalDad Price Index?&nbsp; Let's examine the six months of results, ending with the most recent comparable month of August 2014.&nbsp; Understand that because the CPI is calculated for multiple geographic areas, there's roughly a two month window difference between the most recent PracticalDad and CPI results.&nbsp; For comparison purposes, I'm looking at the 37 foodstuff items of the PracticalDad basket and comparing that sub-index result with the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf" title="Bureau of Labor Statistics">Food-at-home line from the CPI monthly report</a>; the full Food Index from the BLS CPI report also includes the change in prices for food purchased in restaurants so I'm reviewing against the sub-category for similarity.&nbsp; In the table below, I'm showing the monthly Food-Only Index from the PracticalDad site as well as the monthly change from the previous month (M-o-M) for both the PracticalDad and CPI Indices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's most noticeable about the Month-over-Month results between the two is that the PracticalDad Index has a much greater variability from one month to the next than the CPI.&nbsp; This makes sense given that the PracticalDad Index is calculated at only three stores in a single geographic vicinity while the CPI Food-at-home is priced nationally from multiple geographically disparate markets across the country.&nbsp; Likewise, the CPI basket is much larger than the 37 foodstuff items in the PracticalDad basket so that there's a larger number of sampled items; the larger the sample, the less the variability.&nbsp; For a look at the foodstuffs sampled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, see <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpid1408.pdf" title="bls.gov">here</a>, especially down at page 8.&nbsp; Even with this roster from the BLS, it doesn't list the individual items sampled each month.&nbsp; When I began to sample prices in November 2010, it was a purposeful decision to keep the basket manageable, using the most common items that a family would purchase each month, based upon my own experience as shopper, cook and chief bottle-washer through the years.</p>
<p>The monthly pricing for the PracticalDad Index is done solely by me and even with four years of familiarity, it's not uncommon to have to return to a store more than once in order to double-check a particular item.&nbsp; This is particularly the case when there's an incident of stealth inflation and a package size changes.&nbsp; What sometimes makes it difficult is that the change is insidious so that one foodstuff package changes across the stores over a period of months.&nbsp; That said however, the PracticalDad Index has captured instances of stealth inflation in the following products: sugar, orange juice, hot dogs, women's pads, diapers, store brand tomato sauce, cereal, and coffee.&nbsp; In the case of the BLS, the pricing is done by "economic assistants" hired by the individual metropolitan field offices of the BLS; these individuals are trained in what to look for and then set loose with the results forwarded to the DC office of BLS.&nbsp; The data is then inspected by analysts and any questions are returned to the field if there are issues.&nbsp; The analysts do adjust for any qualitative and quantitative changes, but these changes are never reported in the actual report.&nbsp; So even if the changes are noted in the calculations, they are never individually reported in the monthly results.&nbsp; While I actually believe that BLS process is fundamentally sound, the presence of so many different assistants with so many different products to price can lead to some missed prices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that the pricing in the PracticalDad Index is limited to a small area means that there can be a greater examination of the inflation versus deflation scenario as well.&nbsp; The index has captured price increases that are attributable to monetary policy, most especially in the pricing of commodity products when hot money flows into, and then out of, that product.&nbsp; Coffee, Canola oil and sugar are prime examples as their prices exploded several years ago with the hot money flows into the commodity markets; these prices have since dropped from previous highs, even accounting for stealth inflation packaging changes in coffee and sugar.&nbsp; I'm also able to see the deflationary side as individual stores are having to adjust for the increasing lack of consumer buying power.&nbsp; One store in particular has had to simply cut prices of some basic foodstuffs since their customer base doesn't have the funding.&nbsp; The practice has shifted to the other stores in multiple cases as well.&nbsp; Ultimately, it's this micro-scale that helps explain some of the distrust of the CPI figures by the general public.&nbsp; No one person shops in a wide variety of stores and their viewpoint is limited.&nbsp; But not all stores price in the same way and have the same bargaining power with their suppliers; a regional grocery chain simply can't bargain with suppliers as well as a national or international chain such as Royal Ahold.&nbsp; Likewise, different stores serve different customer levels and a customer at Trader Joes won't feel the same pain as one in rural Indiana.&nbsp; When a store raises prices or passes along steath inflationary packaging, you might see it in your store but on a macro-level, it might not be fully processed through the entire system and hence not fully reflected in the CPI.</p>
<p>Here's my own perspective on the issue of CPI reliability.&nbsp; I have come to believe that the mechanism is fundamentally sound, even if the presence of so many "fingers in the pot" can make pricing problematic at times.&nbsp; But if there's issue to be taken, it's to be taken at the upper levels of the government, who split out the more critical sector of food from the CPI component when they determine what increases to put through for benefit recipients.</p>

 <title>Honesty at the College Visit</title>
 <content:encoded><p>This weekend saw yet another college visit for Middle, who is now in his senior year of high school.&nbsp; It occurred at a major urban east coast university and naturally, the place was festooned for the thousands of visiting prospects and parents, who were respectively excited and terrified.&nbsp; Before the breakout sessions for the Admissions/Aid and then the various individual academic schools within the university structure, there was the obligatory reach-'n-grab for all manner of flyers, pens and cheap lanyards as the herd milled past the tables set up in the arena concourse.&nbsp; For all of the obligatory rah-rah however, there was a session of clarity and honesty in the early afternoon and it was eye-opening for the handful who were in attendance.</p>
<p>Middle is an arts kid - creative and talented, someone who appreciates the poetry of E.E. Cummings more than the need to subtract - and in his element, he's a wonder to behold.&nbsp; All of the paternal gush now aside, we joined dozens of students and parents for the Theatre Department's information session.&nbsp; It was hosted by the Theatre Department's Assistant Chair as well as the graduate theatre program director, each with years of experience running this nationally recognized program and it occurred in the front rows before a stage undergoing transformation to the mythical Scottish village of Brigadoon.&nbsp; The department chair spoke about the program and it's structure, as well as the various concentrations and where the graduates were getting work.&nbsp; He then however, commented that if the students were hoping to come here and then simply make it into the big-time, they were suffering from a notion that was <i>preposterous</i>; they would work diligently and hard to learn a craft that might earn them a weekly wage of $150 to start.&nbsp; As he discussed the capabilities of the various adjunct faculty, he told of a graduate who had been on Broadway but was now back and teaching as her mother was helping care for the graduate's child since the typical Broadway salary didn't allow for the burden of childcare expenses.&nbsp; I glanced at Middle, who was silently digesting all of the information that was more telling of reality than he'd get from the glossy brochures that inundate the mailbox.&nbsp; The two of them also acknowledged that they were glad that it was far more affordable for the in-state kids and they didn't blink when a mother later asked about the state residency requirements; this woman was a heavily-accented immigrant who would be willing to move to make this work for her child, even if it meant that her child would have to wait a year for the opportunity.</p>
<p>When it was over, we joined a group who were waiting to make personal comments or ask questions.&nbsp; I thanked the gentleman for his candor and he remarked that he very much understood the issue of tuition.&nbsp; When he himself was in high school, he had the opportunity to attend a college for free and his own father decreed <i>you will go <b>here</b></i>.&nbsp; He then touched his index finger to his thumb to make a small circle that he placed before his eye, and commented that it made a huge difference for him, allowing him to take advantage of opportunities that paid nothing yet provided real dividends for his career.&nbsp; Middle stood nearby listening, taking all of this in and it was invaluable since it wasn't coming from the 'rents.</p>
<p>The old reality of college - <i>the best seven years of my life</i>, as Bluto Blutarsky once commented - is dead.&nbsp; I don't know where Middle will ultimately wind up or what he'll do and I know that the decision will be hashed out in the coming months.&nbsp; But there were three lessons that I believe he took with him from the sessions.&nbsp; The first is that beneath the glossy exteriors and play to the emotions, this is a difficult first lesson in finding the balance between the dreams and the adult realities of the present-day world.&nbsp; The second lesson is probably more important, and that is that this is a decision that will be made with the parents; indeed, the folks might just be more far-sighted than he realizes as he comes to terms with the reality that you can't have it all, despite what it proclaimed in advertising.&nbsp; The third lesson is that it's not just his own Mom and Dad who are asking hard questions, ones that he simply doesn't yet grasp as a teenager.</p>
<p>This coming weekend will see yet another college visit and this time, we'll go as a family and bring Youngest along.&nbsp;He'll be bored at moments and that's fine, he's old and disciplined enough to suffer well for the short duration.&nbsp; But my hope is that even years away from this decision, he'll take enough in to see the process so that he's not so swayed by the marketing that's printed to sway the kids.&nbsp; Because last week, he - now in seventh grade - looked at a brochure sitting on the kitchen island and stated <i>man, I wanna go here 'cause everyone looks so friendly</i>.&nbsp; Yes, the boy's coming along.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Politicians and Parenthood:&nbsp; The Message</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There's a huge and well-deserved knock on politicians, and if a kid states that she someday wants to be a politician then the response of most would be to fault the parents. &nbsp; But there is one particular attribute of successful politicians that parents should remember:  stay on message.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Staying on message</em> means that you aren't easily distracted from one or more salient points that you continually return to when you're with the kids.&nbsp; There can be entire weeks that you don't mention that message but if the opportunity arises, you return to it consistently, bringing the point home again, <i>and again</i>.&nbsp; The message is typically something that drives you and that you want the kids to take to heart, that they'll carry with them moving forward.&nbsp; It's a message that is short and succinct, a parental tagline that fits into the short attention span mindset and is especially crucial in a period in which the kids are getting more conversation from the entertainment/media complex than from their own parents.</p>
<p>In my particular childhood and youth, there were two salient messages that came through from both of my parents.&nbsp; My mother's mantra - derived from a Great Depression childhood - was simply <i>we've gotta pay the mortgage</i>. &nbsp; In a society in which the consumerist mentality had begun to blossom, this simple message was the response to the purposefully created need versus want confusion.&nbsp; You can certainly ask for the latest and greatest toy or trip, but <i>we've gotta pay the mortgage</i>, so your wants be damned, the need of putting a roof over the head first must be met.&nbsp; When I got a little older, it became a running joke with the family and I'd sit at the dinner table, taking potshots like an absurdist ass:  <em>Mom, can I have a new pair of shoes?&nbsp; Nope, (answering myself) gotta pay the mortgage.</em><em>&nbsp; Mom, can I please have a second helping of carrots?&nbsp; Nope, (answering myself) gotta pay the mortgage.&nbsp;</em> My mother suffered the slings in good grace and it wasn't until I was finally living in my own apartment with the full freedom and responsibility of adulthood that this message came back.&nbsp; I worked for a corporation with a load of other twenty-somethings and the conversation amongst multiple co-workers would turn to spending on this or that and presented with a particular decision on a major purchase decision, I found that phrase creep back repeatedly into my head:  <em>gotta pay the mortgage</em>.&nbsp; I could certainly afford the particular item if I took a second job to cover the cost along with the other necessities, such as rent.&nbsp; But the stretch was such that if I lost my primary job, I'd be forced to return home.&nbsp; <em>Gotta pay the mortgage.</em></p>
<p>The message from my father was blunter and broader:  <em>pull your head out of your ass and look around.</em>&nbsp; It was a message that I received repeatedly from around fourth grade onwards, when the thought process starting going to hell.&nbsp; It was harsh and consistent, and would be trotted out when he'd encounter some 'tween/teen stupidity that either I or my sister had said or done.&nbsp; It also became a weird form of bonding between the two of us and when I reached my later teens, we'd actually joke about it and he'd even note that he'd done something proving that he'd demonstrably had his head up his own ass.&nbsp; It was only in my adulthood when he began to open up to my wife and I about his Korean War experiences that the import behind this message came home.&nbsp; There was certainly an element of fate about whether or not a shrapnel fragment or bullet took you out, but there was also an element of carelessness and lack of thought that got you killed as well.&nbsp; As a company first sergeant, which he reached at the tender age of 20 via the demise of his predecessors, he routinely told new arrivals that if they wanted to survive, they'd better find one of the veterans and pay attention to what they did and then copy it.&nbsp; The verbal message to me was harsh but he never scared me with the stories of why he stressed attention, awareness and thought; that phrase is one that I swore that I'd never use with my own kids but there have been a very few instances when it's been trotted out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My own taglines are simple and one of them is a G-rated version of my father's acidic remark: <em>Think.&nbsp; Use your head for more than just a hatrack.</em>&nbsp; The second pertains to the college experience and debt, <em>we need to get you through with as little debt as possible</em> and I talk consistently about the impact of debt on the ability to actually get out of the house and on with their own lives.&nbsp; There's no guarantee of what job or career you'll get, but there's no sense making things worse by starting out with a small mortgage hung around your neck.&nbsp; The phrases aren't embroidered and hung upon the wall nor are they used on a daily basis, but I try to use them consistently and in the same format every time so that it winds up as a rhetorical bumper sticker pasted to their thought process, one that they see every time that they decide to take it out for a ride.</p>
<p>Understand that when the kids get older and more into the world of school and peers, your time around them will lessen.&nbsp; Decide what you value and the lessons that you wish to impart and then find the tagline that best captures what you want to say.&nbsp; Then deliver it again and again and again.&nbsp; Expect that you might even be teased, but keep it up because it's sinking in and it's liable to be at a crucial moment in your child's life when that tagline pops into his head and makes all the difference in a particular choice facing him.</p>

 <title>Teen (Un)Employment</title>
 <content:encoded><p>One of the big knocks on the new and improved economy is the status of (un)employment.&nbsp; There's a push amongst the fast food workers for a higher minimum wage of $15/hour and the response of the fast food industry is to <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/22/technology/innovation/fast-food-robot/" title="money.com">automate the process</a>, rendering the great majority of the workers obsolete.&nbsp; But the real cost of an actual increase in the minimum to $15/hour will be borne by the teenagers, who are forced out of the job market entirely.&nbsp; <em>First, they came for the newspaper carriers and I said nothing, then they came for the yard work and I said nothing...</em>&nbsp; The worst regions of teen unemployment are in the urban areas and there are still part-time and summer jobs available for teens in our area, but there are signs that it's getting interesting.</p>
<p>MIddle has worked on a part-time basis for a friend's small organ repair firm for several years, initially doing the cleanup and yard work.&nbsp; But he came in one day about two months ago and as we chatted, noted that one of the older guys at this small business had commented that he'd be leaving and that it would indeed be permanently.&nbsp; He commented to my son that work was thinning out with far less to do so he might as well just retire.&nbsp; The subsequent kitchen conversation with Middle centered around the idea that if there wasn't sufficient work to keep the adults busy, his days as a teen employee would probably be numbered; that was indeed what happened as our friend had to release him for lack of work.&nbsp; In the interim, Middle did look for other part-time jobs to keep some money in his pocket and his bank account.</p>
<p>What caught my attention was what he encountered at a fast food restaurant.&nbsp; This is actually a pita joint that we've frequented and in a nearby college neighborhood.&nbsp; The food is decent and the owner was advertising at one point for help.&nbsp; Middle took an application and then completed it; what he found when he returned it  however, was that they wouldn't accept it unless he also provided a <em>resume</em>.&nbsp; Seriously, a resume?&nbsp; It's a variant of a fast food joint and the guy is asking for a resume before considering the application?&nbsp; Part of my internal monologue is that there's a reasonable explanation for this, perhaps to teach the youngsters how to walk through the process and give them a taste of what is really required when they hit the pavement looking for a job.&nbsp; Yet the other part of me responds that <em>it's a pita joint fer chrissakes, so have we reached the point that the increased competition is going to be handled much as though they were applying for a position at Chase?</em>&nbsp; The tongue-in-cheek remarks about delivering newspapers and mowing yards are actually true, as the teens are pushed out of those jobs by adults who have in turned been pushed out, much as Native American tribes jostled with one another - sometimes violently - as many moved westwards to escape the coming of the settlers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Americans don't think past the short-term implications such as the kids having less spending money and more free time.&nbsp; But there is a longer-term implication as is already being seen in Europe, particularly along the southern periphery, with youth unemployment reaching upwards of 40% and higher.&nbsp; This is a society-killer as the young adults, locked out of adulthood and unable to get a real start on their own, turn surly and ultimately violent.&nbsp; This is the condition which has led in part to any number of disturbances as desperate and dissatisfied young adults turn to violence to show their frustration.&nbsp; But now the trend towards teen employment has turned a corner and it's come to a small, mostly white-bread Mid-Atlantic city where teens are being expected to handle job searches as adults for positions that will never allow them to afford actually taking their place in the economic world of independent adults.</p>
<p>For the record, Middle took my advice and let it go, finding another job as he proceeds through high school.</p></content:encoded>

 <category>Commentary</category>
 <title>Per the Federal Reserve, We&#8217;re &#8220;Hoarding Money&#8221;</title>
 <content:encoded><p>In a recent article discussing the <a href="http://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/what-does-money-velocity-tell-us-about-low-inflation-in-the-u-s/" title="St Louis Federal Reserve">dramatic decline in monetary velocity</a> - the number of times that a dollar is turned over in the economy as a measure of economic activity - the author states that <em>The answer lies in the private sector’s dramatic increase in their willingness to hoard money instead of spend it.</em> To which I, as a member of the private sector, can only reply <em>no shit, Sherlock.</em></p>
<p>This simple comment is clearly symptomatic of multiple issues facing American society today.</p>
<p>The first is the simple use of the term <em>hoard</em>, a word with clearly pejorative connotations.&nbsp; To previous generations of Americans, the term was <em>save</em> and it was something that was done because the responsibility for the family future was overwhelmingly the responsibility of the family itself.&nbsp; Saving was something done because there were responsibilities such as educating the kids and providing for retirement and it was considered unfortunate and unseemly and unwise to place yourself at the mercy of others.&nbsp; But using the term <em>hoard</em> implies that we are both selfish for not spending and perhaps just a bit mentally ill; gathering everything around us irrationally in fear of the future, retreating to our own little worlds and ignoring the outside world.</p>
<p>The second is the sense that the mandarins at the Fed simply don't see things as the rest of us.&nbsp; Families now have greater uncertainty and competing demands upon their resources.&nbsp; The median family wealth has fallen by a full third in the past decade, the median family income is lower than before and yet it's becoming clear that the fiscal obligations facing the family are rising.&nbsp; The passage of the Affordable Care Act - Obamacare - is hitting more families with higher medical insurance costs than before and as businesses cut out the benefits, then the medical bills themselves will rise as families take on higher and higher deductibles in order to afford even the smallest premiums.&nbsp; The decline of the pension plan means that we're now responsible for our own retirements and parents wonder how in God's name they're going to get the kids educated.</p>
<p>The third is the illustration of the extent to which our economy is now dependent upon <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/638" title="PracticalDad:  CIGXM">consumption</a> as an economic driver in lieu of everything else.&nbsp; We're supposed to ignore the flashing <em>check engine</em> light on our dashboard and continue spending; the point of how off-the-rails we'd become was driven home after 9/11 when the president commented that we shouldn't let the terrorists take over our daily lives but should go shopping instead.&nbsp; We're now caught in an impossible position.&nbsp; The realities facing the family are significant yet the mandarins view the impetus to drive the economy - to spend - as paramount because they don't seem to realize that we're now trapped, and the push to spend is all that they can offer.</p>
<p>In keeping with the present horror craze, many describe ours as a <em>zombie economy</em>.&nbsp; There is no more life left in the consumer model as the family faces competing and frankly, more important, demands upon its resources.&nbsp; Yet the system - and folks, the Fed is at the heart of the system - describes the common-sense response in the pejorative and implies that if we only freed ourselves from our delusions, all would be better.&nbsp; Understand this:  the old system is dying rapidly, if it's not fully dead yet.&nbsp; The system can only push what the system knows, even if it's ultimately more harmful to our families.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - September 2014:&nbsp; New Highs Reached</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The pricing is in for the September 2014 edition of the PracticalDad Price Index and what really caught my eye was the proud <em>New Look!</em> advertised in the upper right corner of the Dial Soap packaging.&nbsp; This makes up for the fact that the soap offered now comes in packages of six bars instead of the previous eight bars, another example of stealth inflation that we've seen over the years.&nbsp; This product is one of the multiple reasons that the PracticalDad Price Index has risen in September to new highs for both the 47 <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">item marketbasket</a> Full Index as well as the 37 item Food-Only Subindex.</p>
<p>The Total Index of 47 items rose to a new high of 111.07 (November 2010 = 100) and the Food-Only Subindex of 37 foodstuff items also rose to a new high of 114.73 (November 2010 = 100), surpassing the previous high index of 114.33 reached in December 2012.</p>
<p>What was notable about the month's data was that stealth inflation has occurred again.&nbsp; In the first instance, a grocer's store brand package of hot dogs decreased in size from a previous package of 16 ounces to the new package of 15 ounces for the same number of hot dogs.&nbsp; This particular grocer has consistently had the highest priced dogs amongst the three separate sampled grocers and it's impossible to determine yet if the other two will follow along with this move.&nbsp; The other instance of stealth inflation will be followed by the other two within the next several months since that product is a national brand, Dial Bath Soap; the new package size comprises six bars instead of the previous eight bars and was found on the shelf of one of the stores.&nbsp; As the others sell off that inventory, they will also begin to sell the reduced size packaging of six bars of soap.&nbsp; The <em>New Look!</em> advertised supposedly refers to the individual bar but with no previous bar for comparison, I can only note that the new look refers to the size of the entire package.&nbsp; In each of these instances, I have continued as before by adjusting the price to reflect what it would be selling for the original package sizing.</p>
<p>Since much attention has been placed on the rise in protein prices, most specifically ground beef, I thought it would be worth noting that in the almost four years since the start of the PracticalDad Price Index, a pound of 80% lean ground beef has risen by 44%, from the November 2010 average price of $3.02/lb. to $4.36/lb.&nbsp; The results for September and the previous three months are listed below.</p>

 <title>A Nine Year-Old With an Uzi?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>On the news that <a href="http://news.msn.com/us/shooting-by-9-year-old-girl-stirs-debate-over-guns" title="msn.com">a nine year-old girl accidentally killed a shooting instructor with an Uzi submachine gun</a>, I could only sit back in slack-jawed wonder and shake my head in literal disbelief.&nbsp; Seriously, who in the hell even considered that this would be a good idea?&nbsp; The range owner?&nbsp; The parents?&nbsp; The dead instructor?&nbsp; Certainly, common sense died well before the child took the weapon and it's with that that the questions now arise once again about gun control.&nbsp; But even before you get to the philosophical questions about the right to bear arms in America, what are some of the common sense questions that a parent should ask before allowing their child to handle a firearm, if at all?</p>
<p>As a full disclosure, I am a gun owner and have had each of my three children undergo basic pistol training with a trained instructor.</content:encoded>

 <title>Re-setting the Home Page</title>
 <content:encoded><p>As schools across the country struggle with budget issues, the majority are looking squarely at one line item for control - paper.&nbsp; So information is now being made available via other means and it's probably in your best interest to reset the browser's home page to the school district website.&nbsp; Kids still come home from school on the first day with a backpack full of paperwork and parents are used to sitting down and culling through the chaff to get to those single pieces of wheat which really do concern them, but it's afterwards that the paper usage is being truly controlled to save money.&nbsp; The upshot is that if you expect to see the information in the kids' backpacks, then you're liable to miss something important.</p>
<p>It was at a different event the other evening that someone shared a statistic that her spouse had picked up at a local school district staff meeting: if the district could cut it's paper cost by 10%, the savings would be sufficient to fund the salaries and benefits of two additional teachers.&nbsp; So the hunt for eliminating paper usage continues in an era of budgetary constraints and it's showing up here - or not, actually - in the household.&nbsp; School calendars sent to each household with a full complement of activities and events?&nbsp; <em>Gone.</em>&nbsp; Paper reminders from advisers?&nbsp; <em>Gone.</em>&nbsp; School planners for each student?&nbsp; Actually not, since the much-smaller and less costly planner was a train-wreck for kids who don't have the capacity to write in very small print; this led to the re-introduction of the older and larger planners.&nbsp; If the schools are going to stress planning skills, then they have to at least give them something with which to work and the less-costly alternative was simply not functional.</p>
<p>The godsend however, is that the information is now being made available online and readily available, provided that the parents are willing to keep up with it.&nbsp; Site tabs lead to school lunch menus and athletic calendars, directories and a full gamut of district policies.&nbsp; Student and district achievements are touted routinely.&nbsp; But the real value of putting the district site on the browser homepage is in those announcements that make you appreciate the heads up, such as the announcement that Youngest's school would be the site for after-school SWAT team training.&nbsp; Had I not seen the article yesterday morning, I would have been mightily surprised when one of Youngest's friends told me last night that the SWAT team was there during his after-school football practice, a tragic training necessity given the times in which we live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So for the next number of years, the browser's home page will be set to the school district's site and the only question will be with what is it replaced when we've finally got the kids through the educational pipeline.&nbsp; And for Middle, who might read this:  whatever it is, it won't be AARP.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Exposing the Kids to Reality</title>
 <content:encoded><p>It was the other day that Youngest, now with a PS3, asked for permission to buy the <em>Call-of-Duty: Black Ops</em> game and my response was a firm <em>no</em>.&nbsp; I understand that he's played the game elsewhere, will certainly play it again at some friend's house and that's alright.&nbsp; But I've made it clear that I won't be purchasing such a game because I want him to understand that there's a grim reality behind the virtual sterility of the two-dimensional game, a world of pain and loss that only the combat-initiated can truly understand.&nbsp; It's a function of my own father, who returned home from the first year of the Korean War a changed man who sold his hunting rifles and swore to neither fire a weapon nor sleep outside again.&nbsp; It was this desire to teach the reality that led to a <a href="http://www.ijreview.com/2014/08/167349-two-sons-asked-call-duty-dad-showed-real-war-middle-east/" title="ijreview.com">Swedish father's trek with his two sons when they asked for a Call-of-Duty game.</a></p>
<p>This father took his two sons on a journey to the Middle East in early 2014 to show them the reality of warfare.&nbsp; Much of the game - like other first-person shooter games - takes place in an urban wasteland of ruins and debris.&nbsp; But it's one thing to move among the virtual debris and fully another to see the rubble around you and recognize that it doesn't go away as it does when the television is turned off; let alone the notion that the people there have to live among it with the knowledge that to them, that brick pile might at one time have been called <em>home</em>.&nbsp; It's an admittedly over-the-top exercise, an expensive lesson that does however, prove his commitment to his personal beliefs.&nbsp; In the course of the two week excursion, they visited a refugee camp and had the figurative impact of young people paralyzed by taking rubber bullets to the spine with the commentary that these youngsters, their own age, would never again be able to engage in any of their favorite sports and activities.</p>
<p>This father does understand that he and his wife are not the only adults having a conversation with their sons.&nbsp; The reality is that the kids - all of them - are having an ongoing conversation with the media/entertainment complex and honestly, it's occurring more readily with many than with the parents.&nbsp; The great majority of fathers in today's world spend less than a half hour each day in any meaningful interaction with the kids while the kids themselves are having a good six hours daily in some interaction with the media/entertainment complex.&nbsp; That complex can be seductive and fun, requiring nothing of the kids apart from their brand loyalty and ongoing viewership.&nbsp; The complex has no other role in raising the child and demands nothing, holds none accountable for grades or chores and will never, ever have to clean up the pieces when the child or teen does something that goes spectacularly, explosively wrong.&nbsp; The only surefire option to competing with the complex is to go full-tilt Amish and for the great majority, that's neither a valid choice nor even an option; what is required at the minimum is the understanding that the other conversations exist and more importantly, the ongoing effort to continually engage the kids whenever and wherever the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>We've had similar opportunities for mind-expansion in this household, although not to the extent of Mr. Helgegren.&nbsp; The first was the decision to let Youngest watch <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/440" title="practicaldad.com">Saving Private Ryan</a> as a third grader.&nbsp; I knew from conversations that he was playing <em>Black Ops</em> at friends' houses, yet wanted him to have a sense of the reality of war and the Spielberg film was the closest that I could conceivably get short of taking the kids to an actual war zone.&nbsp; The effect was what I hoped as he was clearly moved at the grinding violence of the film's opening invasion sequence and it served as the departure point for further, later conversations.&nbsp; The other major occurrence was the decision - only a few weeks after viewing the film - to take the kids to Athens' <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/445" title="practicaldad.com">Syntagma Square</a> during the much awaited - and saved for - trip to Europe.&nbsp; The demonstrations that year took off on the first leg of our trip to Rome and I made repeated visits on the hotel computer to the US State Department website to determine whether there had been a travel advisory issued for Athens.&nbsp; Between that and touching base with the tour company's guides in Athens, we decided to go ahead with that leg of the trip and while it was safe, it was eye-opening for the kids to see militarized riot police and to do so a full three years before the rest of America saw them in Ferguson, Missouri.</p>
<p>And that's the point of exposing the kids to the reality.&nbsp; It's important that we as parents act in what has become an almost counter-cultural fashion because the culture now promotes behaviors and norms that are crass at best and detrimental at worst to the well-being of our kids.&nbsp; There is liable to be blowback to our efforts at conversation and you might even wish to book tickets for a flight to Syria, one-way in the worst moments.&nbsp; But understand that if you keep chipping away at it, keep making an effort, keep finding ways to expose the kids to reality, then there's a decent chance that they're going to actually listen and adjust accordingly.&nbsp; Letting the kids' reality be shaped by the media/entertainment complex is setting them up for future heartache, unprepared for what they actually see when the blinders come off and they have to live in the real world.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index, August 2014:&nbsp; Food Inflation Picking Up Again</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The pricing was done for the August 2014 PracticalDad Price Index and a review shows that while the cost of the 47 item grocery marketbasket declined slightly, from July's 110.20 to August's 110.14 (November 2010 = 100), the Food-Only Sub-index of 37 foodstuff items rose by almost a full half point, from July's 113.22 to August's 113.71 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; The upshot is that, when you consider the 37 foodstuff items alone, the cost of these has risen 13.71% since November 2010 and a full half percentage point in the course of a single month.</p>
<p>The foodstuffs (for a full listing of the PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket, see <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="practicaldad.com">here</a>) did not occur across the board however.&nbsp; Produce and Dairy items decreased very slightly, but the rise was driven by a 2.6% increase in the price of meat - ground beef, hot dogs, eggs, tuna, cooked deli ham, chicken and fish sticks - from the previous month.&nbsp; This is simply showing the retail effects of the supply issues in the economy as the national beef herds have decreased in size to levels not seen in 60 years and pork herds have been hit by PED, which has led to culling to control the disease.</p>
<p>One final comment on the results.&nbsp; Over a year ago, I began to follow what I refer to as the <em>spread</em> and it's this which is the final column in the chart.&nbsp; The idea behind the spread is to simply note the differential between the rise in food prices versus the non-food prices within the basket.&nbsp; What is notable about this is that the food prices have again been increasing and the spread between the Full Index and the Food-Only Index is rising, showing how food costs are now outpacing and driving the basket.</p>
<p>The results for August and the previous three months follow.</p>

 <category>Family / Personal Economics</category>
 <title>DIY</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Our present home is one that was built in 1997, and we purchased out of logistical necessity in late 2007.&nbsp; What I subsequently found out was that we're actually the fourth family to live in the house so that three families lived in it over the previous ten year period, for an average of three years and four months residency per family...in other words, it was flipped multiple times during the realty bubble of late '90s to 2007.&nbsp; On the one hand, it's got a nice layout and meets our needs but we've been encountering the flippers' mentality for the past few months - <em>make it look good, but don't do shit otherwise</em>.&nbsp; Fundamental work has been ignored and I'm running into previous jury-rig repairs that are creating issues when other repairs have to occur; when we first purchased the house - and it's only a house until we make it a home, regardless of what the realtors say - I found to my amazement that the gas furnace had never been serviced since installation.&nbsp; When the gas fireplace in the family room died two years later, I found the same issue as we paid to get it operational again.&nbsp; So now multiple issues are occurring simultaneously and the repairs are potentially costly.&nbsp; So do we pay someone to come in or do I suck it up and manage as much of it as possible?&nbsp; And what does this have to do with the kids?</p>
<p>In a nation in which both the median family income and median wealth has declined in the better part of the last decade, the family budget really isn't able to absorb the stray hits from home and auto repair that it could say, two decades ago (or even longer if you consider the way that the use of debt hid the real effect on living standards).&nbsp; We're reaching a point akin to every ninth episode of <em>Star Trek:  Next Generation</em>, in which Picard orders all power to the life support systems because he spent too much time reasoning with the unreasonable while they reduced his ship to wreckage.&nbsp; I swear to God, Picard could have worked for the SEC or the CFTC.&nbsp; Anyway, if families are now having to figure out more about helping the kids with education and taking on a greater burden in healthcare insurance and costs, let alone set aside for their dotage, there simply isn't the amount to be paid out for every last little repair around the house.&nbsp; What this has to do with the kids is that they see Dad and Mom taking up the work and figuring things out.</p>
<p>Being a do-it-yourselfer requires not just a certain facility with working with your hands, but also a mindset that you're able to both figure it out and adapt when the first approach doesn't work.&nbsp; We've become a nation of specialists, with colleges graduating young adults with very specific skill sets and oriented towards the intellectual over the manual.&nbsp; Mike Rowe of <em>Dirty Jobs</em> fame is probably the first person in a long time to take a crack at dispelling the notion that manual and physical jobs were beneath many Americans.&nbsp; That seems to have taken root and in tandem with the realization the money isn't there, networks like HGTV and DIY have offered more and more shows to educate people on what has to be done.&nbsp; What I've seen in my own household is a growing interest in <a href="http://www.pinterest.com" title="pinterest.com">Pinterest</a> for ideas on projects and links to sites that teach how to do them.&nbsp; This particular site has led to at least one handmade Christmas present and an ongoing effort to create glassware from old alcohol bottles that leaves my garage resembling a bootlegger's storage unit.&nbsp; But while it's frustrating on one hand to know that a section of the garage is given over to that particular project, understanding that an effort is being made to try something different makes the frustration infinitely more bearable.</p>
<p>We live in a culture of instant gratification and that mindset bleeds through to almost everything.&nbsp; Because I'm a decent writer - just saying - I've had parents ask me to help their kids with certain essays, as well as reading some of my own kids' efforts.&nbsp; What is universal amongst the youngsters is the notion that their first effort is the one to be turned in and the universal response to my typical comment that the work was a decent first draft was a consistent disbelief that it wasn't finished and presentable.&nbsp; Many youngsters don't grasp the concept that something isn't going to succeed on the first try and that they might have to re-group and try it a second, third and possibly fourth time and the same process holds true for many Do-It-Yourself household projects in which the person has little or no experience.&nbsp; If the kids are going to learn this, then as parents we might have to put ourselves out there and model that behavior; study plan schematics, go back a second or third time to attempt a repair, and give a serious effort to complete the job before we finally cave in and hire out to get the job done.&nbsp; There's value in failing and learning how to try again.&nbsp; There's value in demonstrating how to use the internet to study videos on how to accomplish a task that might have previously been subbed out to a repairman.&nbsp; There's value in keeping track of the savings so that you can share it with the kids and put it in terms of the opportunity cost of how that money might otherwise be used.&nbsp; We undertook and finished a DIY backyard fishpond refurbishment - at Eldest's insistence and assistance - that saved approximately $4000 off a professional's quote, savings that are worth approximately a semester's tuition at the local state university.</p>
<p>There are always kids who instinctively understand what has to be done in certain projects and how to use their hands.&nbsp; But for many, that understanding isn't going to come if they spend six hours daily in front of a screen and it won't come if they consistently see the parents picking up the phone for an estimate and appointment.&nbsp; When I began this article several days ago, I was looking at multiple repairs split between the house and the car.&nbsp; The first was on Eldest's car and that's one that the two of us handled together instead of farming out to a garage.&nbsp; The second will require a repairman to finish a job that I started simply because it's in a summer heat attic and my middle-aged body gave up the ghost after more than four hours of effort, but at least the project is moved along far enough to save some of the labor costs.&nbsp; The third is one that I'm simply setting up for a professional since all of the separate literature that I read routinely mentions the prospect of significant bodily injury if performed improperly and y'know, that one's just not worth it.&nbsp; It's an imperfect process, but at least the kids are seeing that the effort is being made to keep the costs under control and that's a lesson that they're going to have to take to heart going forward.</p>

 <title>A PracticalDad Look at Concussions</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>Guns don't kill people, 90 mph free kicks kill people.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; Poster on door of Middle's bedroom</em></p>
<p><em>It was during the second half of a mid-season Division II college soccer game with the ball rolling free in the visiting team's penalty box.&nbsp; Both Diane,a forward, and a defending fullback raced from opposite directions towards the ball and the defender reached it in stride about two steps ahead of Diane.&nbsp; The fullback cleared the ball with a strong kick and it traveled perhaps five feet before it collided solidly with Diane's face, connecting squarely in the forehead.&nbsp; Diane dropped flat onto her back, propelled torso backwards by an object kicked with sufficient force that it instantly - violently - eliminated all of her own forward momentum.&nbsp; According to her teammates, the coach was on the field and running towards her as soon as she hit the turf; after several minutes on her back - conscious the entire time - Diane left for both the remainder of the game and the season.&nbsp; The subsequent diagnosis from the university's medical staff was that Diane suffered a major concussion.</em></p>
<p>While it isn't a certainty that it will occur, there's a respectable chance that any active kid will suffer a concussion either through organized sports or the simple <em>*boom*</em> of an accident from hard play.&nbsp; But what exactly is a concussion and what should you expect to see if your child suffers one?&nbsp; And as a full disclosure, the PracticalDad household has had first-hand experience with the injury.</p>
<p>A concussion is the common term for a brain trauma, a sudden event in which the brain is jarred or shaken severely enough that there's an acute injury to it.&nbsp; The design of a person's head is - like the rest of the human body - a wonderful bit of engineering.&nbsp; This crucial organ is housed within the helmet-like skull, but there's actually no contact between the brain and the skull.&nbsp; Between the brain and the skull is a thin layer of fluid which cushions it from the movements and shocks of everyday activity.&nbsp; But a concussion can occur when the body undergoes a physical that overwhelms the cushioning capacity of the fluid and the brain is severely shaken or actually comes into contact with the skull itself.&nbsp; In Diane's case, <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/441962-how-much-force-does-an-average-soccer-player-kick-the-ball-with/" title="livestrong.com">getting pounded by a 430 gram ball kicked around 60 mph</a> is clearly beyond the body's natural absorption capacity.</p>
<p>We used to call a concussion <em>getting your bell rung</em> and the old treatment was taking a few minutes to clear your head before returning to the practice or game.&nbsp; But the bright light of publicity that began years ago with the tragedy of former long-time Steelers center <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Webster" title="Mike Webster">Mike Webster</a> and progressing most recently to San Diego's Junior Seau have brought greater awareness to the insidious damage to the brain caused by concussions, especially if they're repetitive.&nbsp; The long-term toll of concussions is now being given greater attention so that there are improvements both in terms of treatment as well as prevention.&nbsp; What the medical community is now aware of is that the risk of long-term brain damage rises with a person's number of concussions.</p>
<p><em>Concussion Rates:  Who and How Often?</em></p>
<p>For all of the attention being focused on football, a male sport, the reality is that females will suffer a significant number of concussions as well.&nbsp; At the high school level, girls' soccer players reported the next highest number of concussions for any sport after football and girl basketball players suffered concussions at almost the same rate as their male counterparts.&nbsp; For soccer however, girl players suffered concussions at almost twice the same rate as their male counterparts; it's unclear as to why but the prevailing opinion is that it's primarily physiological as the female heads are lighter - lending credence to the many fathers' thoughts that boys are boneheaded - and have weaker neck muscles to support the head when it's hit.&nbsp; The other thought is that culture plays a role as boys are taught to "suck it up" while girls are more likely to say when something is wrong.</p>
<p>For a chart of the concussion rates per common youth sports, by gender, see <a href="http://www.momsteam.com/health-safety/concussion-rates-high-school-sports?page=0%2C1" title="www.momsteam.com">here.</a></p>
<p>Additional research has shown that the incidence rate for concussion is several times higher for those who have already had a concussion; the fact that there's already been trauma creates a lower threshold for a concussion than if the individual had never had one in the first place.&nbsp; In Diane's case, this was her third concussion over a three year period.</p>
<p>There are two upshots here.&nbsp; The first is that your daughter-athlete is as much at risk for a concussion as your son-athlete.&nbsp; The second is that if your child has already suffered a concussion, there's a lower threshold for suffering another from a head trauma than another child-athlete who has not yet had a concussion.</p>
<p><em>Concussion's Symptoms and Diagnosis</em></p>
<p>What makes a concussion difficult to diagnose is that there can be interior damage to the brain even if there's no actual sign of exterior damage to the body, such as a bruise or laceration.&nbsp; This is compounded by the fact that the interior damage might not be immediately evident; while Diane was visibly groggy in the immediate aftermath of the injury, she never lost consciousness and two decades ago, might even have been allowed to re-enter the game if she appeared to have been able since there doesn't have to be loss of consciousness with a serious concussion.</p>
<p>The symptoms that arise from a concussion can be classified into four different categories.</p>
<p>Thinking/Memory</p>
     <li>Inability to concentrate</li>

<p>The takeaway for parents with active kids is this:  if you child is struck in the head - by a ball or bat (been there on both), a hard impact with wall or ground (been there, too) - then there's the prospect of a concussion.&nbsp; Because there might not be an immediate sign, it's best to begin the watch for these symptoms and that watch can last for days.&nbsp; It's not easy and the child's age can make it more difficult, especially if they're younger.&nbsp; For small children - kindergarten or younger - take it as a sign of possible concussion if he or she is showing signs of a regression in skills that you might have considered already mastered beforehand.</p>
<p>If you notice any of these, immediately contact your physician.&nbsp; There are objective cognitive tests that can be performed and don't be surprised if a scan is ordered to ascertain if there's overt damage to the brain, such as bleeding inside the skull.&nbsp; But even if there's no overt sign on the scan, the cognitive tests can help ascertain if the child has been concussed.&nbsp; The only objective examination that can help ascertain the severity of the concussion would be if the child had a pre-injury baseline <a href="https://www.impacttest.com/" title="impact test">impact test</a> such as used by professional and college sports teams; it might sound far-fetched for a child - actually a teen - but more middle and high schools are having their student athletes undergo them prior to the season's start.&nbsp; The online test can be performed on youth as young as 11 years of age if they're involved in sports and can be performed at the office of any medical professional which offers it.&nbsp; In our case, Youngest - a baseball player - took an impact test a year ago at a physical therapy practice which offers the test and the results are now available to serve as a baseline for future reference.&nbsp; After a concussion was suffered, periodic test re-takings would serve as waypoints on recovery when compared to the original baseline examination.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Treatment of Concussions</em></p>
There's no overt treatment regimen - physical therapy, medication - for a concussion and the only help is what was once called <em>the tincture of time</em>.&nbsp; That said, the tincture can be aided by a simple regimen of true rest; this is rest not only from strenuous activity or exercise which might continue to shake the brain, but also rest from the single activity that preoccupies the majority of the waking time of most adolescents, electronics.</p>
<p>When the brain is concussed, the purpose of the recovery period is to avoid any physical stressors to the brain.&nbsp; That certainly includes minimal physical activity and more sleep but what most don't realize is that there are other stressors and these include light, noise and the constant input of watching the flickering of any kind of electronic screen.&nbsp; When I spoke with Diane's father, he commented that he was surprised to find that the treatment regimen for his daughter included as little screen time as possible as the flickering, combined with the constant eye movements, were stressors that aggravated the brain and actually lengthened the recovery period.&nbsp; Other aspects of the treatment regimen included the wearing of sunglasses and a visored cap when outside to shade the eyes and the absolute minimum of traveling so that she couldn't even attend away games with her team, if only to stand on the sideline.&nbsp; In other words, she was to avoid any movement and sensory stimuli that typically cause the brain to work.&nbsp; This treatment regimen was to continue for as long as she had symptoms and in Diane's case, the symptoms continued for a full six weeks before she was finally cleared to return to play and by that point, the season was finished.</p>
<p>The upshot for parents is this.&nbsp; <em>What provides the greatest entertainment for youth today - electronic media - is one of the activities that has to be minimized, if not completely avoided, if the kid is going to recover both the most fully and in the shortest time possible.</em>&nbsp; The small upside is that the kids at greatest risk of concussion are the athletes and are probably on the screens less that the six hour daily average.&nbsp; Yet the kid will still have to avoid the screens as much as possible for the recovery and the stress in the household will be greatly elevated as parents have to take into account the mood and temperament of a child who not only suffers from concussion symptoms, but can't even find respite in those activities which were previously entertaining.</p>
<p>A concussion is a frustrating injury for parents.&nbsp; It requires vigilance from parents to maintain the rest regimen for a full recovery but it cannot be easily judged as to how it's progressing.&nbsp; Likewise, the child should be kept away from the typical favorite pastimes and the stage will be set for potential conflict between child and parent.&nbsp; The other issue for parents is that in their youthful sense of invincibility, the kids don't always understand that they're at an increased risk of reinjury when compared to their uninjured peers and many will balk at the notion that they might not be able to play their favorite sport again.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>And *Boom*...</title>
 <content:encoded><p>...went the summer as one of the kids suffered injuries that have ended his - and our - summer.&nbsp; The accident resulted in a significant orthopedic injury that terminated any plans for baseball or scout camp, as well as any other physical activity.&nbsp; But insult to injury was a concussion that meant that the mental activities that could relieve boredom - television, reading, computer - are also out the window as brain rest is required while the brain heals and sorts itself out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are fortunate however, in that it could have been far, far worse.&nbsp; So we'll take the hit and give thanks for what we have, and I'll go back to the role of nurse.</p></content:encoded>

 <title>Re-evaluating the Pets</title>
 <content:encoded><p>It's interesting how things align since I've just asked Eldest to take the dog outside, on the heels of looking at past bills paid and learning that the <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/419" title="PracticalDad:  What Are BRICS and Why Should I Care?">BRICS</a> are now forming a <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-15/brics-announce-100-billion-reserve-bypass-fed-developed-world-central-banks" title="zerohedge.com">$100 Billion Development bank to rival the IMF</a> .&nbsp; So how do I bridge from the distant sound of dollar-decline to the family dog?&nbsp; The leap is because within the next number of years, the money is probably not going to be there to manage the niceties to which many American families have become accustomed, such as family pets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an animal-friendly family, not so much for political/fashion reasons as much as the simple fact that we just like animals.&nbsp; What started as a single stray cat adopted two months after I married my wife - and I'm a dog guy, so you can see how that early power-struggle turned out - has now morphed into a present stable of four rescued cats, a rescued dog and a rescued snake.&nbsp; Until two months ago, there was also a rescued hamster but he has since moved on to that great wheel in the sky.&nbsp; Simply put, we take in animals and give them homes.&nbsp; But how many resources should be spent on all of these animals, given the ongoing winnowing of the middle class?</p>
<p>We're no different than millions of other Americans who spent more than $56 billion dollars in 2013 on their various and sundry pets.&nbsp; The cost goes beyond food to veterinary bills, toys, corollary products and even pet medications and pet health insurance and God knows that we've covered several of those categories.&nbsp; Our intent has always been to take in strays and rescues since (a) they're there, and (b) they're relatively cheap, at least in comparison to the cost of a purebred puppy or kitten.&nbsp; But it was within the past year that the sense of restraint blew straight through to hell because of three separate animals.</p>
<p>The first animal was a temporary addition to the household, a cat who Eldest found in an animal shelter.&nbsp; Although we were at the full complement of alloted animals, an allotment agreed upon because I simply can't handle any more, a dispensation was made because the shelter assured her that this cat was terminally ill and that they simply wanted him adopted out so that he could die in comfort.&nbsp; One of my concerns to Eldest was financial - how much extra medical was going to be required and for how much would we be on the hook?&nbsp; Assured that the death was likely within weeks, I agreed and "McGee" joined the family although he was restricted to the basement so that the potential upset with four other cats was minimized.&nbsp; Unfortunately, what should have been a cat hospice morphed into a long-term care facility as McGee rebounded with comfortable new surroundings and attention and a very few weeks of life extended into months.&nbsp; There were a few vet visits with labwork, expensive enough, and then McGee finally began a decline that signaled the approaching end.&nbsp; The unfortunate part of this decline was a loss of physical control that utterly ruined Pergo flooring and required my efforts to replace an approximately 60 square foot section with the unused flooring left over from installation years ago.&nbsp; Had I not kept the unused flooring for use in piecing together repair, the upshot would have been several thousand dollars in new flooring.&nbsp; We subsequently had him put down because his health had finally declined both precipitously and disastrously, for him and for us.</p>
<p>The second animal was our elderly Golden Retriever, who we took in as a pup from a local family because she was picked on and badgered by their older dog, for whom they had purchased her as a companion animal (because every pet needs a pet, right?).&nbsp; This lovable spastic girl, had she been human, would have been on meds for ADHD and was periodically frustrating in her goofiness.&nbsp; The costs for Cassie were what you'd expect for a responsible dog-owner with vet and food bills; as she aged however, we did shift the care during vacations and other absences from a kennel to a responsible known-quantity teen who could housesit for us in our absence.&nbsp; The thought process in this shift was two-fold since we'd have to have someone come in to monitor the cats anyways and it could also allow the dollars spent to go even more locally, to a teen who could apply it to college.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The financial hole came late one evening last year, the night before we were to leave for a week's vacation, when Cassie stepped on a glass shard from a jar that had broken when it was dropped by one of the kids the day before.&nbsp; Although the kid had done a presumably thorough job in cleaning up the mess, he didn't account for the fact that shards could travel into the next room and lodge themselves into the carpet.&nbsp; I had just finished <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/671" title="practicaldad.com">an article</a> and when I stepped away from the computer, found the retriever licking furiously at her paw to stem the prodigious blood flow from the wound; the shard had done far enough into the paw to sever the artery and the blood was flowing freely into the carpet.&nbsp; Because this was a late night, the option was to get her to the emergency vet center and that's what happened to my night-before-late morning departure while my wife and older kids went to work on the blood in the family room carpet.</p>
<p>This veterinary center has a policy that after initially addressing the immediate problem, the manager will speak with the pet owner and provide an estimate as to the cost of actual treatment for the injury or illness.&nbsp; My situation, according to the manager, was a deep puncture wound with a severed artery - <em>and she would've bled to death if you hadn't found her</em> - that required full-blown surgery to repair, including general anesthesia, to the tune of more than $1100.&nbsp; I blanched at the cost and texted with my wife, but it didn't occur to either of us not to proceed, and I was frankly surprised that the manager was actually happy and relieved that we'd do so.&nbsp; This was my first inkling that the middle-class winnowing has hit the pet business since the manager's experience was that many owners would simply have cut their losses at the visit and opted for euthanasia.&nbsp; The upshot is that I returned home in the early morning with a thoroughly groggy and miserable dog, who required considerably more care from Eldest's housesitting friend during the coming week, including a followup appointment with our regular vet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was around the time of the dog's injury that my wife's beloved older cat, Bear, became notably off in his behavior.&nbsp; As with the other animals, Bear was adopted as a stray, but this was a cat who was as much a gentleman as any male of any species that I've ever seen.&nbsp; He was lovingly attentive to his person - my wife - and actually helped maintain order amongst the other animals in the household, including the retriever.&nbsp; When we adopted two male kitten siblings years ago, I witnessed this cat physically corner the two little ones after a rambunctious period and discipline them, laying down the law to them in whatever language that the felines use with one another; it was honestly one of the more amazing things that I've seen in my years.&nbsp; When the listlessness and mewing continued for a few days, we took him to our regular vet, who diagnosed him with bladder cancer.&nbsp; Because there were actually surgical options, we opted for that route but after several months with some improvement, Bear declined dramatically and we were forced to put him down to save him further pain.</p>
<p>And several weeks later, I had to return to the emergency vet one evening when the retriever suddenly couldn't walk.&nbsp; The girl was suffering from a liver tumor that had ruptured and was now bleeding out internally, a situation that was simply untreatable and within 90 minutes of arrival at the vet center, she was put down.&nbsp; It was honestly a relief to know that it was untreatable since I was mentally tallying the costs that we'd incurred in the previous three months and it spared me from having to make an unpleasant choice of euthanasia or further treatment costs.&nbsp; For a guy who prides himself on a straight-forward and logical approach to things, I was torn by multiple thorns: sadness that this sweet, goofy girl was leaving; anger at myself that I could have missed any early warning signs that might have prevented this sudden trainwreck; concern over the amount of money that I might wind up spending; and a strange wish to show the center staff that I was indeed a good guy and not a cheapskate who wouldn't spring for treatment.&nbsp; The reality was that I really didn't have a choice but that still hasn't salved the lingering irritation.</p>
<p>The financial upshot of these incidents cost us in the thousands of dollars over a three month period, money that I had simply had no idea would be incurred and far beyond the usual monthly costs that we incur for our animals.&nbsp; After a recent visit to the vet for another animal, the office manager commented that I might want to consider purchasing health insurance for the animals; an expenditure that I simply find objectionable given the human need that we face in America.&nbsp; But the events and my responses also demonstrate that the new generations of American parents are going to have to be willing and able to steel themselves for the instances when the cost of pet ownership momentarily spirals out of control, to simply say no and cut the losses when they occur.</p>
<p>Economists understand that there's a principle called <em>opportunity cost</em>, meaning that the money spent now could instead be spent in another way or saved for a different priority.&nbsp; The consumerist mindset of having it all has combined with the easy credit availability to lull people into thinking that choices don't have to be made when you can do both, paying for at least one over time.&nbsp; But one of the recurring thoughts during that period was the realization that the money was finite and there were uses for that money elsewhere; in at least one of three animal situations, emotions took over the thought process.&nbsp; My philosophy is now changing to recognize that there is indeed opportunity cost for my family, especially now that another kid is looking at college.&nbsp; What will happen now is the admission that we simply can't afford the extended care and recognizing that in providing a loving home for these cast-offs, they're still far better off than they might have been otherwise.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index July 2014:&nbsp; Eating Hamburgers for Fiber</title>
 <content:encoded><p>It's a less than delicious irony that on the day that I gathered the prices for the July 2014 PracticalDad Price Index, I stopped at a local Burger King for a Whopper and fries.&nbsp; Later that evening, I read that Burger King is one of a number of fast-food chains that are extending beef supplies - and padding profits - <a title="qz.com" href="http://qz.com/223742/there-is-a-secret-ingredient-in-your-burgers-wood-pulp/">by using MCC (Microcrystalline Cellulose), aka wood pulp</a> in their burgers.&nbsp; The irony is that for all of the Burger King concern about rising meat prices, the cost of a pound of 80% lean ground beef was unchanged in July from the previous month.&nbsp; The less than delicious part was the taste in my mouth when I realized that I not only have to now concern myself with cavities, but also splinters.</p>
<p>As to the PracticalDad Price Index, the Total Index of the 47 item <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="practicaldad.com">market basket</a> actually declined slightly to 110.2 from June's 110.53 (November 2010 = 100) so that the total price of the market basket of grocery and related items was 10.2% higher than in November 2010.&nbsp; When the ten non-food items (soap, aluminum foil, etc) are removed so that 37 core food items remain, that 37 item Food-Only Index actually rose to 113.22 from June's 112.65 (November 2010 = 100) so that the cumulative price of the 37 items has risen 13.22% since November 2010.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big movers in previous months - meat and dairy - were essentially flat with only a minor rise in the cost of a pound of hot dogs and pound of chicken with the cost of ground beef unchanged.&nbsp; The big increases this month were in wheat based products - specifically hot dog rolls and spaghetti - as one of the three grocery retailers jacked prices on those items by 29% from the previous month.&nbsp; Note that this retailer, which has had some profitability issues, unilaterally cut prices on specific core items as part of a program to show their customers that they were passing along savings; this was not a one or two week sale, or even a two month sale but instead a program that actually changed the unit price labelling on the shelves for an extended period of time.&nbsp; Well, that program ended and the prices for some of these items are now rejoining their brethren amongst the other stores.</p>
<p>The point to take from this is not that one retailer was masking the issue, but instead that the issue of inflation is a conflict between monetary policy (commodity prices such as sugar, aluminum and et cetera), supply-demand issues (dairy and meat) and actual deflation due to the economic weakness of the end consumer, who is watching his/her income continually decline.&nbsp; This particular retailer has had issues related to profitability and has had to take measures to shore up the customer base and provide competition based upon price instead of other factors.</p>
<p>The story about Burger King is one more brick in the mental wall that I'm building against corporations.&nbsp; The ostensible line is that they're just trying to keep prices down for the end-consumer but the real question for me is when the addition of the cellulose extender began, because the recent rise in meat prices is relatively recent and probably post-dates the cellulose usage.</p>
<p>And here's the update for July and previous months.</p>

 <title>Traveling With the Kids:&nbsp; IG2BTK Tour 2014</title>
 <content:encoded><p><em>IG2BTK.</em></p>
<p><em>It's Good to Be The King</em>.</p>
<p>The site's been silent recently since we just returned yesterday from a two week trip to Europe - Paris, London and Edinburgh - which was dubbed the <em>It's Good to Be The King 2014&nbsp;</em>tour.&nbsp; This is the follow-up to the family's 2011<em> European Collapse </em>tour (<a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/444" title="here">here</a> and <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/445" title="here">here</a>).&nbsp; Just as I found that traveling with children changes as they age, it continues to change as they work their way through the teen years (Eldest is no longer a teen and Youngest might as well be for what it's worth).&nbsp; I clearly remember when traveling with kids meant assuring that there were sufficient diapers and plenty of activities planned to make the physical aspect of traveling easier for the youngsters.&nbsp; But that's progressed and while I love traveling with the family, there are moments when the changes are jarring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's worth noting with the teens and nascent adult?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure that the kids understand that if breakfast is included in the cost of the room, then they'd better take advantage of the &quot;free food&quot; instead of sleeping in and then looking for a lunch because they're hungry.&nbsp; For that matter, make sure that the kids understand the difference between a continental breakfast - the serve yourself available at places such as Hampton Inn - and what is referred to as an <em>english breakfast</em>, which is prepared by a cook and brought by staff for an additional charge.&nbsp; Likewise, keep water bottles refilled so that you don't have to spend money needlessly on water.</li>
    <li>Make sure that they understand that they are clearly prey for any number of grifters and beggars.&nbsp; Paris was loaded with gypsies at public sites who approached with request for petition signatures; the catch was that if you signed the petition, you'd receive small useless token as thanks and a demand for money to pay for said token.&nbsp; I first learned this schtick in New York City last year after signing a petition for some Buddhist about his temple.&nbsp; He gave me some meaningless fabric flower petal and demanded $20 and when I refused, it got...unpleasant.&nbsp; I'm fortunate that my paternal male line has a recessive <em>asshole</em> gene for such moments.&nbsp; The kids learned to simply repeat <em>no</em> and keep on walking.</li>
    <li>Press personal security.&nbsp; Men's wallets should be shifted to the front pocket and women's purses should be held with the strap over the shoulder and the zipper compartment secured.&nbsp; Since I carry a backpack during the travels, I kept it slung over the shoulder with the zippers secured towards the front so that they were near the hand grasping the strap in order to thwart anyone who might try to unzip it from the rear.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the kids know what to expect from the weather and can pack accordingly, and likewise for any special events planned that might require better dress.&nbsp; Since the last stop on the tour was Edinburgh, Scotland, I checked the expected weather in advance and found that the mid-June averages were a full 20 degrees less than here, akin to a mid-Spring day instead of summer.&nbsp; Also decide whether you trust them to pack without a physical luggage check or if you just want to run through a checklist prior to departure.&nbsp; The kids are old enough now that if they choose to ignore common sense in clothing choices, they can suffer well if they're chilly.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Expect moments of cognitive dissonance since the kids are now growing and are capable of far more than they were younger.&nbsp; This was personally the case with Eldest, who is well into college and could legally order alcohol at meals.&nbsp; Our traveling philosophy is that the kids should experience the local culture as much as possible but within the bounds of legality and this especially goes to the issue of alcohol.&nbsp; What is the legal drinking age where you're at?&nbsp; It was 16 in Italy, so Eldest could have an occasional beer or wine at dinner during the <em>Collapse</em> tour in 2011 while Middle could only share ours.&nbsp; But it's 18 in France, England and Scotland and the wait staff throughout was assiduous in carding, so Eldest could again order at dinner - and not occasionally - while Middle was again stuck sharing ours.&nbsp; My only caveat with Eldest was that she have something that wasn't usually available here <em>so if you're going to have a beer, make sure that it isn't a Budweiser</em>.&nbsp; The dissonance also struck in handling the processes since Eldest was much quicker in figuring out the Paris metrocard machines than I was, leading to an apology to her for being brusque because I couldn't believe that she had it down quicker than me.</li>
    <li>Security goes beyond the physical and to the cyber aspect as well.&nbsp; Kids should be aware that while they can certainly share with their friends, such a prolonged trip isn't something to be announced via Facebook or another social networking platform where literally anybody - and if the kid has more than 500 &quot;friends&quot;, it's anybody - can see that the house is wide open for pillaging and/or epic parties.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Use any opportunity available for teaching the kids, whether it's about politics, economics, history or simply life.&nbsp; Our accommodations in London were a classic mix of the sixth level of Dante's <em>Inferno</em> and John Cleese's <em>Fawlty Towers</em> and as satisfying as yelling would be, I was cognizant that the kids were watching.&nbsp; So the lessons were twofold:&nbsp; first, that the person in front of you is liable to not be the person responsible for your dilemma so yelling is probably harmful since you become the enemy instead of the wronged customer; second, that you need to have a plan and know what you actually want when you find that one responsible party. Talk about the situation and pick it apart with the kids, and then share the results of any actions or conversations with them.&nbsp; In other words, plan, execute and then do a post-mortem on the situation.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Teach the kids to double-check that what they've purchased is actually what's wrapped up by the sales staff.&nbsp; Twice this trip, my wife and I found that items that we thought we were purchasing weren't what actually came out of the package.&nbsp; My wife was more upset since she was purchasing silk scarf whereas I was bringing home a bottle of scottish whiskey and cream.&nbsp; I'll certainly see through my disappointment, but it might not be as easy for a ten-year old who had her heart set on a special something.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of our principal family values is the exposure to other cultures and we'll continue to travel as the opportunities arise - or we make them.&nbsp; But all things change and the nature of the family vacation does as well with the aging and maturing of the kids.&nbsp; Carpe diem.</p>

 <content:encoded><p>Since this site started, I've managed to put out hundreds of articles at a fairly steady pace - although it has declined in the past several months due to family demands.&nbsp; Life is going to again intrude on the writing and the site will be silent for a few weeks.&nbsp; Still here since I've managed to renew the domain name without screwing that up, but the new articles will be quiet.</p>
<p>But things will flow again in a few weeks and I hope that you will continue reading.&nbsp; Thanks for reading the articles and putting me on the RSS feed, which is about the only metric to which I pay attention.</p>
<p>It is greatly appreciated.</p>

 <title>Conversation with the Teen:&nbsp; Is the American Middle Class Dead?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>You know that a concept has hit the mainstream when high school social studies teachers raise it in class.&nbsp; Such was the case with the apparently imminent death of the American Middle Class, a topic that was raised by Middle's honors history teacher the other week.&nbsp; This teacher is a known and highly respected quantity since Eldest made it a point to tell Middle that he had to get this guy if at all possible since he makes it a point to riff on the subject matter with topics of modern consequence.&nbsp; As he discussed the industrialization of the Far East, he shifted the topic over to the problems facing today's American Middle Class and it was a topic that Middle brought home in a later conversation.</p>
<p>What Middle, and most, know is that the American Middle Class is suffering from a significant income drop over the past decade due to a true paucity of jobs.&nbsp; He's aware that many of the jobs now created are of the lower paying, benefit-free variety in the service sector so that the typical American that loses a decent survivable wage job can replace it with a lower paying job.&nbsp; The first whammy is the loss of income and the second whammy is the new need to suddenly pay for previously &quot;free&quot; benefits that had been covered by the former employer such as health insurance.&nbsp; <em>Okay, you not only now have less but you have new and unexpected uses for that decreased income...</em>When the news hit that millions of health insurance policies were being cancelled and the former policyholders were being forced to go to the market via the 1929 Obamacare Flivver (with a rumble seat), we had to explain that the cancellations were actually expected since the old policies were non-compliant with the new health insurance feature. Reissuing new ones with the required features, available to anyone now, would cause new policies with wholly new pricing.&nbsp; Lesser income, likelihood of more variant hours worked and a new category for the money than what was faced by the parents are huge stressors.</p>
<p>So the middle class is under assault but like the refrain from the old Monty Python skit goes, <em>I'm not dead yet...</em></p></content:encoded>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index - June 2014 - Prices Up (But Due to Supply, Not the Fed&#8230;)</title>
 <content:encoded><p>The results of the June 2014 PracticalDad Price Index are in and it tracks with what we're seeing in the media as prices are up again, driven by increases in dairy and meat prices.&nbsp; The Total Index for the 47 item grocery marketbasket rose from May's 109.85 (November 2010 = 100) to June's 110.53.&nbsp; Removing the ten non-food items in the basket (see the basket composition <a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="here">here</a>), the Food-Only Index for the remaining 37 foodstuff items rose significantly from May's 111.54 (November 2010 = 100) to June's 112.65.&nbsp; In other words, the price of the representative foodstuffs in the basket are up 12.65% since November 2010's Index inception but the Food-Only Index is still well below the high of 114.33 reached in December 2012.</p>
<p>There appears to be a significant difference between the reasons for the recent and prior price increases however.&nbsp; In late 2012, there were significant increases in the prices of commodity items such as canola oil (affected by oil prices and the offsetting rise in biofuel demand), sugar and coffee due to the apparent flow of hot money liquidity caused by the existant quantitative easing process.&nbsp; But since then, the Federal Reserve has step-decreased the quantitative easing to approximately $45 Billion per month so that the money isn't flowing as readily as it did previously.&nbsp; When the Food-Only Index peaked in December 2012 at 114.33 (14.33% over the November 2010 start), the average cost of a 48 ounce bottle of canola oil was $4.09 and the cost of a five pound bag of sugar was $3.49.&nbsp; As of June 2014 however, the cost of the same size bottle of canola oil is $3.96 and the adjusted cost of a bag of sugar is $2.82; note that the sugar has been adjusted upwards to a five pound bag size since the grocers and producers have decreased the standard size bag of sugar via <em>stealth inflation</em> to a four pound bag.&nbsp; The unadjusted price of a bag of sugar is even less now.&nbsp; It's the same for coffee.&nbsp; Even though the producers utilized <em>stealth inflation</em> packaging changes to decrease the size of the standard can from 13 ounces to anywhere between 11 and 11.5 ounces, the adjusted cost of the can of coffee (back to a 13 ounce equivalence) is now averaging $3.30.&nbsp; This is down from the December 2012 can price of $4.47, for a decrease of 26% over the same 18 month period.&nbsp; Again, the hot money has receded...</p>
<p>But why the renewed price increases now?&nbsp; After the December 2012 peak, the Indices actually began to decline and you could watch the ongoing combat between the Fed policies and deflationary forces caused by a weakened economy.&nbsp; But the uptick began again recently and this time is due not to monetary policies but to actual forces of supply and demand.&nbsp; In the past year, the size of the national cattle herds have actually dropped to <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-01-23/us-cattle-herd-61-year-low-and-organic-food-shortages-are-being-reported-all-over-am?page=1" title="zerohedge.com">lows not seen since 1952</a> and drought out west is worsening, affecting the food and dairy supply out of that region.&nbsp; Beef has since increased in the cost per pound as well as dairy and cheese prices; also on the cusp is the effect of PEDV - Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus - which has caused hog farmers to cull herds with affected swine.&nbsp; This disease began in the US in mid 2013 and has spread with an impact on the cost of bacon and ham.&nbsp; While I do not track the cost of bacon, a pound of sliced cooked deli ham has risen from $4.83 in December 2012 to $6.32 in June 2014 for an increase of almost 31% in an 18 month period.</p>
<p>This is clearly beyond the purview of the Fed policies and it probably makes some within the bowels of the Marriner Eccles Building happy since it accomplishes what they wanted in the first place.&nbsp; The only problem is that these price issues are beyond the immediate remedy of the Powers That Be and compound the impact of a decreasing family income.</p>

 <title>A Prophet In His Own Land</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There are times when it's better for the kids to hear it from another adult since repeated commentary in the household smacks of the <em>prophet in his own land</em> deal, just more nonsense spewing out of the old man's mouth.&nbsp; Today was one of those rare occasions when one of the kids got to hear it full bore from another parent, even if that kid was Eldest, the college student who actually gets it.</p>
<p>She's home on summer break and joined me at the grocery store.&nbsp; Our cashier at the checkout line was a mother of two that had, at one time, gone to our church.&nbsp; Her kids are of similar ages to Eldest and Middle and as we transacted business, I inquired as to their whereabouts.&nbsp; The discussion was fascinating because it encapsulated both what I've been saying to my kids for years as well as providing a snapshot of larger economic issues.&nbsp; Neither of her kids are now in school, although her eldest had spent a year in college before transferring elsewhere and ultimately dropping out.&nbsp; There was significant discord in her household as she and her husband refused to take out a <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/types/loans/plus" title="PLUS loan">PLUS loan</a> or co-sign for any loans that he might take on himself, leading him to withdraw for now.&nbsp; It wasn't that they didn't want to; but both Mom and Dad recognized that the old college model - <em>the best seven years of my life</em> - are gone.&nbsp; The boy wasn't deadly serious about it and uncertain as to what he wanted; topping it off was that Dad had lost his own job and their own finances were shaky although they at least owned their home free and clear.&nbsp; The unhappy conclusion for their Eldest was that he would find a job and pay off his existing student debt while he figured out his next step.&nbsp; The cashier's daughter is graduating in a week but has decided, despite straight A's and a stellar athletic stint, that she'd rather work for now while she figured out her next steps.</p>
<p>What came through in the conversation, as Eldest listened, were several points.&nbsp; First, that there really is a shortage of livable wage jobs out there for young adults as this woman's kids are struggling to find adequate employment.&nbsp; Second, that the student loans really are a deadweight on household formation, a cornerstone of viable economic growth; she commented that her kids, and others that she knew, were having difficulty pulling together the down payment for a used car, let alone for a house.&nbsp; This is borne out by the recent Zerohedge/Pew Research article showing that the <a title="zerohedge.com" href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-05-18/net-worth-college-grads-student-debt-20-less-high-school-grads-no-debt">average net worth of a college graduate with student debt is a full 20% less than an unindebted high school graduate of the same age</a>.&nbsp; As she pointed out to Eldest, her wish - and mine as well - was that the adult kids would come for Sunday dinner and visits, not every breakfast without fail.&nbsp; My contribution to the conversation was the third point, one that Eldest has heard me make before:&nbsp; if an average young person's lifespan is expected to surpass 80 years, does it make sense to take on the debt now instead of growing a bit and letting the post-high school smoke clear?&nbsp; Make sure that there's a plan for college, otherwise take some time to get your life in order before incurring the cost.</p>
<p>Eldest clearly wants to be out in the great wide world on her own.&nbsp; She's smart and in the past several weeks that she's been home, I've noted thought processes that were dormant in earlier years and some of these go to standing on her own two feet.&nbsp; She didn't say much in the conversation with the cashier acquaintance but I could tell that the persistent home meme about student debt had paid off, leaving her with the prospect of doing what she wants when college is through.&nbsp; Setting up her own place and moving out into the great wide world.</p>
<p>Now I have to keep talking to her younger siblings.&nbsp;</p>

 <title>So, What Did You Learn?</title>
 <content:encoded><p>There are moments when it's entirely appropriate to rain fire and brimstone upon a kid or teen for behavior or stupidity, and there are other moments when it's unnecessary because they're raining it upon themselves.&nbsp; This typically happens in competitive situations when an error causes points to score and it's especially likely - for many kids - when it involves a team sport and the letdown affects teammates as well. There are parents out there who will willingly take the kid to task for the error but it is, in most cases, needless and unnecessarily painful because any worthwhile kid is beating himself up for all of them.</p>
<p>Such was the case this entire baseball season for Youngest, whose team is providing ample opportunities for what can best be described as &quot;character-building lessons&quot;.&nbsp; Decent pitching and hitting is wholly overwhelmed by poor fielding and a complete lack of understanding on what to do with that round white thing when it's hit into the field.&nbsp; Dropped balls are treated as dead plays when they are actually as live as a hand grenade and easy outs are wrapped in tinsel and handed to the other teams as tickets that can be exchanged by opposing teams for more and more runs.&nbsp; Once that truck starts moving downhill, then it's difficult to stop and eventually everybody climbs aboard as almost everything degrades.</p>
<p>With multiple kids, other responsibilities and two parents, it's problematic getting to everything and I missed seeing a recent Saturday afternoon game.&nbsp; But I heard about it in glorious, gory detail in the kitchen as Youngest related one particular play in which he was involved and which allowed the winning run to score in the last inning.&nbsp; I could hear the embarrassment in his voice and even though it takes more than one person to make up a team, he blamed himself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's the best approach?&nbsp; Do I look for the bright side in every little thing and minimize the particular play?&nbsp; Or do I lose my cool and hammer the kid?&nbsp; God knows that I've heard plenty of parents through the years hammer their kids for a mistake.&nbsp; There's ultimately no way to put lipstick on the pig so after hearing the story, I opted to simply stop preparing dinner and ask <em>so what did you learn from this?&nbsp; What's your lesson?</em>&nbsp; And after stopping for a moment, he simply responded <em>I have to know where the play is going to be made. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>A similar scenario played out with Middle in an after-school conversation the other day.&nbsp; He has a teacher whose reputation is that he'll challenge the kids and he apparently lives up to it, based upon what I hear.&nbsp; In class, the teacher posed an analogy for the Ottoman Empire with a $5 payoff to anyone who could get it right.&nbsp; Multiple kids took the stab and failed and Middle mouthed an answer to a neighbor, who then claimed it publicly as his own.&nbsp; It was also the correct answer and the neighbor took home $5.&nbsp; When Middle approached the teacher after class, he admitted that he'd seen Middle mouthing the answer to the other kid yet did nothing when it was claimed...<em>so what did you learn from this? &nbsp;</em>I inquired.&nbsp; Middle shook his head and acknowledged that he might as well take the shot at an answer, at a minimum.&nbsp; I agreed and noted that the teacher was also explicitly teaching him - Middle - a lesson that is invaluable even if it doesn't come from a book.</p>
<p>Our job as fathers and parents is to prepare them for life, to help them learn to think for themselves and stand on their own and that's not going to happen if we don't stop and make them think.&nbsp; I've even walked through my own screwups and laid out the lessons that I should take from the situation, what my own father referred to as the Post Mortem.&nbsp; Giving them pep talks or dressing them down simply isn't of much value unless they actually learn the lesson that should flow from their growing experiences.</p>

 <title>The College Food Bank</title>
 <content:encoded><p>It's been awhile since I've written on the college debt issue although the topic has certainly had play within the household as Eldest continues her way through college and Middle starts to examine options.&nbsp; But while inured to the issue, I was <em>appalled</em> to find that the local state university's Student Christian organization now runs a food bank for students so that they have something to eat.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because in an effort to get through with as little debt as possible, students are cutting out the student meal plan and getting by on what they can cadge.</p>
<p>This particular food bank is not officially sanctioned by the university as any approved student organization but is indeed one of the multiple services offered by the campus student christian organization.&nbsp; It has a paid chaplain whose salary is covered by the local ministerium of churches but no other staff and it's office is located in a university provided building.&nbsp; The need was noticed a very few years ago by the chaplain when he found that some students were simply going without and then hitting events in order to feed themselves.&nbsp; Now the notion of college students living on ramen isn't new and even I had friends and acquaintances eating cheap hot dogs, spaghetti and ramen in college; but what's different is now that these students can't even afford the cheapest food and are simply doing without in entirety.&nbsp; When I spoke with my own pastor, who sits on that group's board and informed me of the bank's existence, she stated that what they were handing out were single serving items such as instant soup or single serving mac/cheese which were easy to fix when there are minimal kitchen facilities.&nbsp; The kids aren't cutting out the niceties to go to the basics, they're being forced to cut out the basics in the entirety.</p>
<p>There's now a fundamental disconnect in our society.&nbsp; We sell the importance of a college education and many kids take it to heart, yet we saddle them with crippling debt and a barista job at Starbucks.&nbsp; Now that they're getting the disconnect, they're doing everything that they can - unhealthy as it is - to still get the degree.&nbsp; It's time to rethink higher education and put our money where our mouth is...because God knows that more than a few kids aren't putting anything in their mouths.</p>

 <title>PracticalDad Price Index:&nbsp; May 2014</title>
 <content:encoded><p>Although this is being posted later than would normally happen, the pricing for the May 2014 PracticalDad Price Index occurred at the first of the month and the results were simply unexpected.&nbsp; For all of the talk about incipient inflation - given credence by April 2014's jump in the 37 item Food-Only Segment Index by greater than 1.5 points - the battle between Fed desired inflation and deflation continues as both of the indices declined again; this was led by Food-Only Segment Index literal collapse of greater than 2 points from April's 113.59 to May's 111.54 (November 2010 = 100).&nbsp; The results are listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table width="500" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="1" align="left">
    <caption>PracticalDad Price Index - May 2014</caption>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most notable about this result is the sheer size of the index swing downwards - more than 2 full index points - and especially on the heels of the largest upward swing of 1.53 full points in the previous month.&nbsp; If the marketbasket were a machine, I'd swear that the vibrations were increasing in such a manner as to damage it.</p>
<p>So for all of the talk about inflation, why the sharp move downwards?&nbsp; Remember that deflation is symptomatic of a decline in the money supply as well as incomes and if the money supply is at all time highs, then prices are declining because the producers/retailers are having to drop them to help maintain sales; the Great Depression of 1929 was a situation in which businesses lost all control of their pricing because of a collapse in jobs and income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In May 2014, the index decline was again due to the price decreases in multiple food items at one store.&nbsp; This same store has had <a title="PracticalDad Price Index - February 2014:  Deflation is Taking Hold" href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/695">greater than a half dozen food item price cuts</a> since January 2014 and an additional three food items saw price declines as of the May pricing excursions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Let's put this in perspective.&nbsp; The PracticalDad Price Index marketbasket is composed of 47 common grocery store items, of which 37 are foodstuff products (for a complete list of the items in the marketbasket, see </em><a href="http://www.practicaldad.com/index.php/article/357" title="PracticalDad Price Index:  November 2010">here</a><em>).&nbsp; Of the three constituent stores surveyed, one store has had price cuts in ten separate foodstuff products from the Index - more than a quarter of the food items - in the past five months. </em></p>
<p>There were certainly price increases in meat and dairy products as the cost of milk rose and the effects of the national beef herd culling rolls through to the consumer, but these factors were more than offset by the efforts of a grocer to stay afloat amidst a customer base that is cutting back spending because it's being starved of income in the bifurcated American economy.<em> <br />
</em></p>
<p>I'm waiting to see if and when this trend starts to hit the other two grocers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps it should say long-leggedy teenagers, instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask any middle-aged parent about teenagers and the response is liable to be an audible sigh accompanied by a visible shaking and dropping of the head.&nbsp; They are capable of things that are utterly breathtaking to the parents - <em>where in the hell did that come from? -&nbsp;</em>to be immediately followed by an equally breathtaking lapse of the most basic common sense.&nbsp; As I pause on the threshold of having three kids within the teen pipeline, Youngest on the verge of entering and Eldest on the verge of exiting with Middle in the...middle, it occurred that I exist in a perpetual and abiding state of PACE (Perpetual Annoyance and Chronic Exasperation), far different from what I recall during their early years when it was a given that the onus of most personal care and thinking fell upon me instead of them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was easy to remember when they were tykes that the burden fell upon me for the majority of their care.&nbsp; But the tykes grow into more adult-sized bodies, albeit often disproportionate with feet and/or hands placed upon the extended limbs that don't quite mesh the rest of their forms.&nbsp; The result is a sense, and I freely admit unfounded, that this life-size ersatz adult should be able to think with the structure of an adult mind.&nbsp; This isn't to say that I expect them to understand much about the adult American world since most adults don't seemingly comprehend it either, with it's opaque financial and cultural structures that defy understanding and increasing security structures that discourage even questioning.&nbsp; It's a common recurring misconception of mine, that believes that possessing size 12 feet also confers a degree of common sense when the reality is that the visible body's size is wholly unrelated to their ability to think and use even a minimal degree of common sense.&nbsp; <em>Seriously, I'd expect that such a possibility would even remotely cross your mind...</em>as my blood pressure increases over the short period of time.</p>
<p>But what happens to the teenage brain over the pubescent teen years is far different.&nbsp; Feet grow and body hair develops, but the child's brain is doing things that have taken the breath of neuroscientists away.&nbsp; With the development of the MRI and CT-scan machines, someone had the bright idea of doing periodic brain scans for the same children - akin to snapshots - at regular intervals over the course of years.&nbsp; The upshot of these scans was the realization that the brain of the typical kid was literally rewiring itself with new pathways being formed over the course of years.&nbsp; When I first learned this, my response was <em>so when I told her to take out the trash on three different </em><em>instances, it didn't happen because the requests were stuck in synaptic construction traffic.</em>&nbsp; This knowledge is a sop to the frustration when clothing is strewn about, milk left and requests/commands ignored; but the accumulation of stuff still drives my blood pressure upwards and leaves me wondering, what else to do?</p>
<p>But for all of the teeth-grinding frustration, there are moments when I realize that despite the haywire thinking processes, the kids are developing character and making choices that reflect a growing awareness of the world and their place within it.&nbsp; This character, and the understanding of the difference between right and wrong, is something that I consider even more important than the developing ability to think.&nbsp; This is the literal framework within which they will think as adults, the lens that focuses their decisions reached after thought, consideration or perhaps the occasional coin toss.&nbsp; Until they're on their own, all that I can do is try to bite my tongue - or not bite theirs - and hang onto the knowledge that this too shall pass when their brains catch up with the rest of their bodies.&nbsp; The effort until then is to talk with them and try to help them develop the structure with which they can think their way through problems and questions.&nbsp; It should also go without saying that the character work has to continue as well.</p>

 <title>The Virus Cocktail</title>
 <content:encoded><p>I must be slipping.</p>
<p>This morning saw a quick early morning run to the grocery store for the ingredients of the PracticalDad family virus cocktail, apple juice and Sprite.&nbsp; They are the ingredients that for years,I kept on the basement storage shelves precisely for the moment when I heard the night-time Siren's call, <em>I'm not feeling well and think that I have to throw up. &nbsp;</em>Which is what my wife and I heard from Youngest in the middle of last night as he entered our room.&nbsp; We both got up with him and after settling him back into bed, I took disinfectant wipes to the touchable surfaces in the kids bathroom; I then settled into the Eldest's vacant bed in the room next to his in the event that there were other issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each family seems to have its own magic elixir for handling illness and ours is the virus cocktail.&nbsp; We adopted it for multiple reasons, not least of which is an effort to at least keep the sick ones hydrated and away from an emergency room IV drip for dehydration and excepting one occasion amongst three kids, it's worked.&nbsp; The non-acidic apple juice contains much needed vitamin C to help bolster an ailing immune system and is supplemented by the Sprite so that the antsy stomach isn't out-and-out assaulted by the juice; when we're fixing it, we even stir it before delivery to remove the carbonated bubbles so that again, the stomach is spared.&nbsp; The fact that it's tasty also makes sipping it less of a chore than water, which an ailing kid is likely to look at with an unspoken <em>blecchhhh </em>crossing the face. We also kept a spare bottle of Pedialyte on the shelves to help correct the sick child's body chemistry but found that the taste was simply unappealing and after a horrendous session years ago, coaxing a sick child to take in some nutrients only to meet them again within 15 minutes, the option was to stick with the cocktail.</p>
<p>When the kids were very small and I knew that my better half was leaving on business, it was a point to assure that we had at least two bottles of each within the house.&nbsp; We seemed to live under a curse that left one or more kids simultaneously - or sequentially - ill with one thing or another and with her gone, any sickness left me housebound to manage until their recovery or her return.&nbsp; Within two days of either, it was a given that I'd be in the same boat as the now-healed children.&nbsp; But as the kids have grown and learned to cope with the illnesses, the practice of stocking for the cocktail has fallen into disuse so that this most recent event left me ill-prepared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's easier now that the kids are a bit older and not so physically incapable of caring for themselves.&nbsp; There's no panic with sickness and a sense of routine - <em>okay, here we go again so just stay to my room, nap and let it run the course -</em> and sure enough, when Eldest was sick the other week in college, my wife received a text announcing the stomach virus with the news that a roommate had already been dispatched to the nearby grocery for...apple juice and Sprite.&nbsp; Eldest then took to her room with her cocktail and let it run the 24 hour course.&nbsp; On the refrigerator door is a note to remind me to pick up the replacement ingredients for the cocktail on my next trip so that I'm not caught unprepared again.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I need to stock up on more hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.</p>
